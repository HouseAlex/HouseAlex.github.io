259,SAM:,"I let Lucifer out, I gotta put him back in."
259,SAMIFER:,Sammy's long gone.
259,CASTIEL:,It's his soul. It's gone.
259,DEATH:,"I can't erase Sam's Hell, but I can put it behind a wall."
259,DEATH:,"Keep digging, Dean."
259,DEAN:,"Are you just going to be cryptic, or..."
259,DEATH:,It's about the souls.
259,CASTIEL:,I will save Sam. But only if you stand down.
259,DEAN:,What happened to you Cas?
259,CASTIEL:,I'm at war.
259,CROWLEY:,"I want to discuss a simple business transaction, that's all."
259,CASTIEL:,You want to make a deal? With me?
259,CROWLEY:,It's the souls.
259,CASTIEL:,They're all inside me. Millions upon millions of souls.
259,CASTIEL:,"The angel blade won't work, because I'm not an angel anymore. I'm your new god. You will bow down and profess your love unto me, your Lord, or I shall destroy you."
259,BOBBY:,"Well, all right then. Is this good, or you want the whole ""forehead to the carpet"" thing?"
259,CASTIEL:,"Stop. What's the point if you don't mean it? You fear me. Not love, not respect, just fear."
259,SAM:,Cas...
259,CASTIEL:,"Sam, you have nothing to say to me; you stabbed me in the back. (to BOBBY and DEAN): Get up."
259,DEAN:,"Cas, come on, this isn't you."
259,CASTIEL:,The Castiel you knew is gone.
259,DEAN:,"So what, then? Kill us?"
259,CASTIEL:,"What a brave little ant you are. You know you're powerless, you wouldn't dare move against me again. That would be pointless. So I have no need to kill you. Not now. Besides...once you were my favorite pets before you turned and bit me."
259,DEAN:,Who are you?
259,CASTIEL:,"I'm God. And if you stay in your place, you may live in my kingdom. If you rise up, I will strike you down. Not doing so well, are you Sam?"
259,SAM:,I'm fine...(clears throat)...I'm...fine.
259,DEAN:,You said you would fix him - you promised!
259,CASTIEL:,"IF you stood down, which you hardly did. Be thankful for my mercy. I could have cast you back into the pit."
259,DEAN:,"Cas, come on, this is nuts! You can turn this around, please!"
259,CASTIEL:,I hope for your sake this is the last you see me.
259,DEAN:,"Sam, you okay?"
259,CASTIEL:,"Understand. If you followed Raphael, if you stood against me, punishment is certain; there is nowhere to hide. The rest of you, our Father left a long time ago, and that was hard. I thought the answer was free will. But I understand now. You need a firm hand. You need a father. And I am your father now. Be obedient, children. Or this will be your fate."
259,CASTIEL:,"It is a new day. On earth, and in heaven. Rejoice."
259,DEAN:,"(Grunts) Come on. (grunts) (the sound of groaning metal is heard as he tries to push the dented roof out with his feet). Come on, baby!"
259,BOBBY:,"So, you fixin' her or primal screamin'?"
259,DEAN:,"Ah, thanks. How's Sam?"
259,BOBBY:,He's still under. But alive.
259,DEAN:,Yeah? What about God part deux?
259,BOBBY:,"I got all kinds of feelers out, so far diddly."
259,DEAN:,And what exactly are you looking for?
259,BOBBY:,"Exactly. What? Miracles, mass visions, trenchcoat on a tortilla? I don't know what I'm lookin' for."
259,DEAN:,"Ah, well, he'll surface."
259,BOBBY:,"So say we do suss out where ""new and improved"" flew off to..."""
259,DEAN:,Yeah?
259,BOBBY:,The hell we plan to do about it?
259,DEAN:,"I don't know, Bobby, I got no more clue than you do."
259,BOBBY:,"I don't even know what books to hit for this, Dean."
259,DEAN:,"Well, figure it out! I'm sorry. This ain't in no book. If you stick your neck out, Cas steps on it. So you know what I'm gonna do?"
259,BOBBY:,What?
259,DEAN:,"Imma fix this car. Because that's what I can do. I can work on her 'til she's mint. And when Sam wakes up, no matter what shape he's in, we'll glue him back together too. We owe him that."
259,BOBBY:,I'm with you.
259,SAM:,Hey Dean.
259,DEAN:,"Ah, you're walking and talking."
259,SAM:,"Yeah. I, uh, put on my own socks, the whole nine."
259,DEAN:,"Well, that's uh... I mean you, uh, you sure you're okay?"
259,SAM:,"Yeah. My head hurts a little, but...basically."
259,DEAN:,Seriously?
259,SAM:,"Look man, I'm as surprised as you are but, yeah, I swear."
259,DEAN:,"Good! No reason putting a gift horse under a microscope, right?"
259,SAM:,Yeah. So what happened with Cas?
259,DEAN:,"Why don't you come help me with the car, I'll fill you in?"
259,SAM:,Okay.
259,REVEREND:,"Plenty speak for them and their so-called lifestyle. Media, Hollywood, Lady Gaga won't shut up for love or money."
259,REVEREND:,"Yeah, funny, but that's why we raise our voices! And picket their so-called weddings, and their funerals. Someone has to speak for God."
259,CASTIEL:,"You're wrong, I am utterly indifferent to sexual orientation. On the other hand, I cannot abide hypocrites like you, Reverend."
259,REVEREND:,"Okay, fun's over friend."
259,CASTIEL:,Tell your flock where your genitals have been before you speak for me.
259,REVEREND:,And who the heck are you?
259,CASTIEL:,I'm God.
259,CASTIEL:,"And he who lies in my name shall choke on his own false tongue, and his poisonous words shall betray him."
259,VOICE:,Castiel...
259,VOICE:,Cas!
259,SAM:,"No, no, this can't be happening."
259,BOBBY:,"It's Cas, we think. Come on."
259,SAM:,Yeah. Coming.
259,SAM:,Motivational speakers?
259,DEAN:,"Yeah, I'm not sure new Cas gets irony any better than old Cas. Of course, old Cas wouldn't smite Madison Square Garden just to prove a point. He is off the deep end of the deep end. And there's no slowing down."
259,SAM:,"So, what? Try to talk to him again?"
259,DEAN:,Sam.
259,SAM:,"Dean, all we can do is talk to the guy."
259,DEAN:,"He's not a guy. He's God. And he's pissed. And when God gets righteous, you get the hell out of the way; haven't you read the Bible?"
259,SAM:,I guess...
259,DEAN:,"Cas is never coming back. He's lied to us, he used us, he cracked your gourd like it was nothing. No more talk; we have spent enough on him."
259,SAM:,Okay.
259,DEAN:,Hand me that socket wrench.
259,CROWLEY:,"Educate me, Lewinsky."
259,CASTIEL:,You look stressed.
259,CROWLEY:,Bollocks.
259,CROWLEY:,"So, the jig is up. You found me."
259,CASTIEL:,I never lost you.
259,CASTIEL:,"These scratches, they're all useless."
259,CROWLEY:,Still.. Can't blame a girl for trying.
259,CROWLEY:,Fancy a drink before you smite me?
259,CASTIEL:,No.
259,CROWLEY:,"You like to bend them right over, do you? Let's go."
259,CASTIEL:,"I'm not going to kill you, Crowley. I have plans for you."
259,CROWLEY:,What's it?
259,CASTIEL:,"Here's our new arrangement; I let you live, you return to your post as king of hell."
259,CROWLEY:,but?
259,CASTIEL:,"I choose where each soul goes. I control the flow, and you take whatever I give you."
259,CROWLEY:,"I take it you intend to keep the live share? So, what you're saying is hell's being downsized?"
259,CASTIEL:,"I would have done away with it completely, but I need a threat to hold over my enemies, and we need to keep Michael and Lucifer's cage."
259,CROWLEY:,"Right. I gather this is not a, uh, negotiation."
259,CASTIEL:,No.
259,CROWLEY:,"Then I graciously accept, boss."
259,CASTIEL:,I'll be in touch.
259,SAM:,Dean... Bobby?
259,BOBBY:,She's looking good.. Considering.
259,DEAN:,Considering? I should do this professionally.
259,BOBBY:,So.. Seen Sam lately?
259,DEAN:,"Yeah, why?"
259,DEAN:,"What? Well, spit it out."
259,BOBBY:,"How is that kid even vertical? I mean, Cas broke his damn pinata."
259,DEAN:,I know.
259,BOBBY:,"I mean, I get how he came to help us back at the lab. Adrenaline. Sure, but now?"
259,DEAN:,Well.. he says he's okay.
259,BOBBY:,How?
259,DEAN:,I don't know. I just pray to God it's true.
259,BOBBY:,We need to come up with a new saying for that.
259,DEAN:,"Seriously though, Bobby. Look at our lives. How many more hits can we take? So, if Sam says he's good.. GOOD."
259,BOBBY:,You believe that?
259,DEAN:,Yeah.
259,DEAN:,No. You wanna know why? because we never catch a break. So why would we this time? I just.. just this one thing. You know? but I'm not dumb. I'm not going to get my hopes up just to get kicked in the daddy-pills again.
259,SAM:,Hey.
259,BOBBY:,"Hey. How are you feeling, sport?"
259,SAM:,Can't complain!
259,DEAN:,Great. What's the word?
259,SAM:,"Well, a publishing house literally exploded about an hour ago. The guy has a body count that's really getting up there. We gotta do something."
259,BOBBY:,"What we've got to do is hunt the son of bitch. Unfortunately, I lost my God guns."
259,SAM:,"Well, I mean is there some kind of heavenly weapon? Maybe something out of that angel arsenal that Balthazar stole? There has to be something that can hurt him."
259,DEAN:,"He's God, Sam. There's nothing, but there might be someone."
259,CROWLEY:,No. No! NO! Come on!
259,BOBBY:,Don't act so surprised.
259,CROWLEY:,My new boss is going to kill me for even talking to you lads.
259,DEAN:,"Well, you're lucky we're not stabbing you in your scuzzy face, you little piece.."
259,SAM:,"Whoa, wait! What new boss?"
259,CROWLEY:,"Castiel, you giraffe."
259,BOBBY:,Is your boss?
259,CROWLEY:,"Is everybody's boss. What do you think he's going to do if he finds out we've been conspiring? You do you want to conspire, don't you?"
259,BOBBY:,No. We want you to just stand there and look pretty.
259,CROWLEY:,Listening.
259,DEAN:,We need a spell to bind Death.
259,CROWLEY:,Bind? Enslave Death? You having a laugh?
259,DEAN:,Lucifer did it.
259,CROWLEY:,That's Lucifer.
259,SAM:,A spell's a spell.
259,CROWLEY:,You really believe you can handle that kind of horsepower? You're delusional!
259,DEAN:,Death is the only player on the board left that has the kind of juice to take Cas.
259,CROWLEY:,They'll both mash us like peas. Why should I help with a suicide mission?
259,BOBBY:,Look! Do you really want Cas running the universe?
259,CASTIEL:,"You're a true believer. People say I'm wrathful, but I only punish liars and those who forsake me. I am a just God."
259,CASTIEL:,See.
259,CASTIEL:,No.
259,BOBBY:,Hello?
259,BOBBY:,It's from Crowley.
259,DEAN:,"Well, Who feels like hog tying death tonight?"
259,BOBBY:,Old age is over-rated anyhow.
259,BOBBY:,"Well, we've got most of this stuff, but we're going to have to make a run for a few things."
259,DEAN:,Like?
259,BOBBY:,Like an act of God crystallised forever.
259,SAM:,What's that supposed to mean?
259,BOBBY:,"I think it means an actual crystal. See, lightning strikes sand at the right angle - it crystallises into the perfect shape of itself."
259,SAM:,Lightning. Act of God.
259,BOBBY:,Jinga. You got yourself a fulgurate and we're gonna need a biggie.
259,DEAN:,And let me guess... rare.
259,BOBBY:,I found records of an auction. Winning bidder lives about nine hours from here.
259,DEAN:,Excuse me. You got any Grey Poupon?
259,SAM:,Grey Poupon? Seriously?
259,DEAN:,It's what popped in my head.
259,DEAN:,Hi. Uh... I don't want to hurt you. Really.
259,DEAN:,I get that.
259,DEAN:,"Okay. Yeah. Good. Hey, guys. Uh, so this is Dr. and Mrs. Weiss."
259,SAM:,Hi. Sorry.
259,DEAN:,I found the God thingy.
259,BOBBY:,"Well, let's light this candle."
259,DEAN:,You're welcome.
259,BOBBY:,"Te nunc invoco, mortem. Te in mea potestate defixi. Nunc et in aeternum!"
259,DEAN:,Um... Hello? Death?
259,DEATH:,You're joking.
259,DEAN:,"I'm sorry, Death. This isn't what it seems."
259,DEATH:,Seems like you bound me.
259,DEAN:,"For good reason, okay? Just, uh, hear us out. Um... Fried pickle chip? They're the best in the state."
259,DEATH:,"That easy to soothe me, you think? This is about Sam's hallucinations, I assume?"
259,DEAN:,What?
259,DEATH:,"Sorry, Sam. One wall per customer. Now unbind me."
259,SAM:,We can't. Y-yet.
259,DEATH:,This isn't going to end well.
259,DEAN:,We need you to kill God.
259,DEATH:,Pardon?
259,BOBBY:,Kill God. You heard right. Your... Honor.
259,DEATH:,What makes you think I can do that?
259,DEAN:,You told me.
259,DEATH:,Why should I?
259,DEAN:,"Because... We said so, and we're the boss of you. I mean... Respectfully."
259,CASTIEL:,Amazing.
259,SAM:,Cas.
259,CASTIEL:,"I didn't want to kill you, but now..."
259,DEAN:,You can't kill us.
259,CASTIEL:,"You've erased any nostalgia I had for you, Dean."
259,DEAN:,"Death is our bitch. We ain't gonna die, even if God pulls the trigger."
259,DEATH:,"Annoying little protozoa, aren't they? ""God""? You look awfully like a mutated angel to me. Your vessel's melting. You're going to explode."
259,CASTIEL:,"No, I'm not. When I've finished my work, I'll repair myself."
259,DEATH:,"You think you can because you think you're simply under the weight of all those souls, yes? But that's not the worst problem. There are things much older than souls in Purgatory, and you gulped those in, too."
259,CASTIEL:,Irrelevant. I control them.
259,DEATH:,For the moment.
259,DEAN:,"Wait -- uh, what older things?"
259,DEATH:,"Long before God created Angel and man, he made the first beasts -- the Leviathans."
259,DEAN:,Leviathans?
259,DEATH:,"I personally found them entertaining, but he was concerned they'd chomp the entire petri dish, so he locked them away. Why do you think he created Purgatory? To keep those clever, poisonous things out. Now Castiel has swallowed them. He's the one thin membrane between the old ones and your home."
259,CASTIEL:,Enough.
259,DEATH:,Stupid little soldier you are.
259,CASTIEL:,"Why? Because I dared open a door that he shut? Where is he? I did a service, taking his place."
259,DEATH:,Service? Settling petty vendettas?
259,CASTIEL:,No. I'm cleaning up one mess after another -- selflessly.
259,DEATH:,Quite the humanitarian.
259,CASTIEL:,"And how would you know? What are you, really? A flyswatter?"
259,DEATH:,"Destined to swat you, I think."
259,CASTIEL:,Unless I take you first.
259,DEATH:,"Really bought his own press, this one. Please, Cas. I know God, and you, sir, are no God."
259,DEAN:,"All right, put your junk away, both of you. Look, call him what you want. Just kill him now!"
259,DEATH:,All right. Fine.
259,CASTIEL:,I'm here to see the Senator.
259,CASTIEL:,Abuse of power.
259,CASTIEL:,I am not petty. I'm punishing a woman who causes poverty and despair in my name. I put your needs first. Don't you understand?
259,CASTIEL:,All of you. I am a better God than my father. How can I make you understand?
259,DEATH:,Ahh.
259,DEAN:,Um...
259,DEATH:,"Shut up, Dean. I'm not here to tie your shoes every time you trip. I warned you about those souls how long ago? Long enough to stop that fool. And here we are again, with your little planet on the edge of immolation."
259,DEAN:,"Well, I'm sorry. All right? I've been trying to save this planet, so maybe you should find somebody better to tip off."
259,DEATH:,"Maybe I should spend my effort on a better planet. Well, it's been amusing."
259,SAM:,"Wait, h-hold on, hold on. Just -- can you give us something? You -- you have to care a little bit about what happens to us."
259,DEATH:,"You know, I really don't. But I do find that little angel arrogant."
259,DEAN:,Great. Let's go with that.
259,DEATH:,Your only hope is to have him return it all to Purgatory. Quickly.
259,SAM:,We need a door.
259,DEATH:,You have everything you need at that lab. Get him to return there and compel him to give up the power.
259,DEAN:,Compel?
259,DEATH:,Figure it out.
259,BOBBY:,"But that door only opens in the eclipse, and that's over."
259,DEATH:,"I'll make another. 3:59 Sunday morning, just before dawn. Be punctual. Don't thank me. Clean up your mess. Try to bind me again, you'll die before you start. Nice pickle chips, by the way."
259,CASTIEL:,No. No. No.
259,SAM:,You want some coffee with that?
259,DEAN:,It's 6:00 p.m. somewhere.
259,SAM:,"We got to hit the road. I mean, how are we supposed to get Cas to that lab by friggin' 3:59 a.m.?"
259,DEAN:,We don't.
259,SAM:,"What do you mean, ""We don't""?"
259,DEAN:,"I mean, we can't bring the horse to water, and we can't make it drink. Why fool ourselves?"
259,SAM:,"Dean, look, I know you think that Cas is gone --"
259,DEAN:,It's 'cause he is.
259,SAM:,"He's not! He's in there somewhere, Dean. I know it."
259,DEAN:,"No, you don't."
259,SAM:,"No, I don't. But, look, I was pretty far gone sometimes myself, and never gave up on me."
259,DEAN:,"Yeah, and it turns out that you're about the same open book as you've always been. Hallucinations? Really? I got to find out from Death?"
259,SAM:,What was I supposed to do?
259,DEAN:,How about not lie? How about tell me that you've got crazy crap climbing those walls?
259,SAM:,"Why? You can't help. You got a lot of pretty severe crap swinging your way lately, and -- and I thought --what? I thought why burst the one good bubble you had left? It's under control."
259,DEAN:,"What? What, exactly, is under control?"
259,SAM:,I know what's real and what's not.
259,DEAN:,Sam --
259,SAM:,"Dean, look, we can debate this once we deal with Cas."
259,DEAN:,"Yeah, you know how I'm gonna deal? I'm gonna stuff my piehole, I'm gonna drink, and I'm gonna watch some Asian cartoon porn and act like the world's about to explode because it is. Hey. You got to be kidding me. ""Massacre at the campaign office of an incumbent Senator by a trench-coated man."" There's security footage. Well, I think reaching Cas is, uh... out of the cards."
259,SAM:,"Hey, Castiel. Um... Maybe this is pointless. Look... I don't know if any part of you even cares, but, um, I still think you're one of us, deep down. I mean, way, way, way off the reservation, but... Look, we still have till dawn to stop this. Let us help. Please."
259,SAM:,Only if you turn that off.
259,CASTIEL:,Sam?
259,SAM:,Cas.
259,CASTIEL:,I heard your call. I need help.
259,CASTIEL:,"We need the right blood. There's a small jar -- end of the hall, s-supply closet."
259,SAM:,Got it.
259,CASTIEL:,Dean?
259,DEAN:,"What, you need something else?"
259,CASTIEL:,"No. I feel regret, about you and what I did to Sam."
259,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, you should."
259,CASTIEL:,"If there was time, if I was strong enough, I'd -- I'd fix him now. I just wanted to make amends before I die."
259,DEAN:,Okay.
259,CASTIEL:,Is it working?
259,DEAN:,Does it make you feel better?
259,CASTIEL:,No. You?
259,DEAN:,Not a bit.
259,LUCIFER:,"I know. It all seems so silly, doesn't it? Hi, Sam. Long time, no spooning."
259,SAM:,You're not here. You're in Hell.
259,LUCIFER:,"Now, that you're right on."
259,SAM:,Meat hooks... Chains... You. It's not real. It's just my brain leaking memories from the cage 'cause of the wall breaking down. That's all.
259,LUCIFER:,"Hmm. That's very good, your little theory. It's wrong. Sam, this isn't you going guano. Everything else is."
259,SAM:,What?
259,LUCIFER:,Everything... From the second you sprung out of that lock box.
259,SAM:,That's impossible.
259,LUCIFER:,"No. Escaping was impossible. I have to say, I think this is my best torture yet -- make you believe that you're free and then... Yank the wool off of your eyes. You never left, Sam. You're still in the cage... With me."
259,BOBBY:,Hang in there. Just a couple of minutes. Where's Sam? It's go time.
259,DEAN:,Sam?! Damn it.
259,BOBBY:,"That's good enough. Okay, step right up, Cas."
259,BOBBY:,"Ianua magna purgatorii, clausa est ob nos lumine eius ab oculis nostris retento sed nunc stamus ad limen huius ianuae magnae et demisse fideliter perhonorifice paramus aperire eam."
259,CASTIEL:,"I'm sorry, Dean."
259,BOBBY:,"Creaturae terrificae quarum ungulae et dentes nunquam tetigerunt carnem eius ad mundum nostrum nunc ianua magna, aperta tandem!"
259,DEAN:,Cas?
259,BOBBY:,He's cold.
259,DEAN:,Is he breathing?
259,BOBBY:,No.
259,DEAN:,Maybe angels don't need to breathe.
259,BOBBY:,"He's gone, Dean."
259,DEAN:,"Damn it. Cas, you child. Why didn't you listen to me? Cas?! Hey! Hey! Okay. All right."
259,CASTIEL:,That was unpleasant.
259,DEAN:,"Let's get him up. Easy, there."
259,CASTIEL:,I'm alive.
259,BOBBY:,Looks like.
259,CASTIEL:,I'm astonished. Thank you -- both of you.
259,BOBBY:,We were mostly... just trying to save the world.
259,CASTIEL:,I'm ashamed. I really overreached.
259,DEAN:,You think?
259,CASTIEL:,I'm gonna find some way to redeem myself to you.
259,DEAN:,"All right, well, one thing at a time. Come on. Let's get you out of here. Come on."
259,CASTIEL:,"I mean it, Dean."
259,DEAN:,"Okay. All right. But let's go find Sam, okay?"
259,CASTIEL:,You need to run now! I-I can't hold them back!
259,DEAN:,Hold who back?
259,CASTIEL:,"They held on inside me. Dean, they're so strong."
259,DEAN:,Who the hell --?
259,CASTIEL:,Leviathan! I can't fight them. Run!
259,DEAN:,Go! Go get Sam! Go get Sam!
259,LEVIATHAN:,Too late.
259,DEAN:,Cas?
259,LEVIATHAN:,"Cas is -- he's gone. He's dead. We run the show now. Ah. Oh, this is going to be so much fun."
260,BOBBY,
263,STYLIST:,There you are.
263,STYLIST:,All right.
263,STYLIST:,10 minutes. Holler if you need anything.
263,WOMAN:,Chris!
263,WOMAN:,Ow. Chri— Ow.
263,WOMAN:,"Ow. Chris, get back here!"
263,WOMAN:,[screaming] Chr-i-i-i-is! Chris!
263,STYLIST:,"Oh, my God. Somebody, help!"
263,CHRIS:,Aaaagh!
263,SAM:,Leave me alone! I said shut up! Just stop! Stop!
263,DEAN:,You are what you are. You will kill again.
263,AMY:,I won't. I swear.
263,DEAN:,Somebody better be chasing you.
263,SAM:,It's good for you.
263,DEAN:,"No. No, it's not good for you. Look at you. You're, you're a mess, and you stink. Well, while you were out being Lance Armstrong..."
263,SAM:,That would be biking.
263,DEAN:,"...I was working. You ever heard of a town called Prosperity, Indiana?"
263,SAM:,Has anybody?
263,DEAN:,"Two of their fine citizens died over the past two weeks. Uh, this one chick, she, uh, roasted underneath one of those beehive hair dryers at the hair salon..."
263,DEAN:,...and this other guy boiled in a hot tub.
263,SAM:,You don't see a lot of that.
263,DEAN:,"No, you don't."
263,SAM:,It's worth checking out.
263,DEAN:,Yeah.
263,SAM:,"You know, one more thing. What's going on with you?"
263,DEAN:,"We have had this conversation, Sam."
263,SAM:,"No, we haven't. See, to do that, you'd have to, uh, sort of...speak."
263,DEAN:,"Okay, let's see if you can get this straight. See you're – you're new Sam, right, Lance Armstrong."
263,SAM:,Biking.
263,DEAN:,"And, uh – and I'm still me, okay? All right, so – so, you might see things different now, uh – call it a runner's high or some crap – but that doesn't mean that something's going on with me, okay?"
263,SAM:,"Yeah, okay."
263,DEAN:,"No, don't say, ""yeah, okay,"" like, ""yeah, okay."""
263,SAM:,"Yeah, okay."
263,SAM:,I'm very sorry. I-I know this is a tough time to have to talk about all this.
263,WOMAN:,"I've already been through it so many times with the lawyers, the police, the insurance guys."
263,SAM:,Right. I know. I know. We just – we have to conduct our own separate investigation. I'm sorry. I know it's tough. Can I ask you – did your sister have any enemies?
263,SAM:,"No. No, no, no. We just have to consider every possibility. Is there anyone who might have wanted to harm her?"
263,SAM:,What about this man who died – Carl Dunlap? Did she know him?
263,SAM:,"Well, Wendy was in real estate, right? Carl was an architect. Maybe they had some business dealings?"
263,DEAN:,And nobody was back here but Wendy.
263,CHRIS:,No. But I was only gone for a minute.
263,DEAN:,You can't even crank these things past a certain temperature – am I wrong?
263,CHRIS:,"If it started to blow a fuse or something, it would have shut down."
263,DEAN:,"Oh. Basically, you're saying that this couldn't have happened."
263,CHRIS:,"Basically, I'm saying it couldn't have happened."
263,CHRIS:,The insurance adjusters already did that.
263,DEAN:,Thanks for the heads-up.
263,MAN:,"Oh, come on!"
263,DEAN:,"So, what do we know about the vic?"
263,POLICEMAN:,"Dewey Stevens – owner, Dewey Stevens Construction, biggest outfit in town. Rotarian, Methodist, tenor, blue-ribbon pecan pie champ, asthmatic."
263,POLICEMAN:,We're a close-knit community.
263,DEAN:,"So, this, um, pillar of the community – he was taking a leak before he, uh, sprung a few?"
263,POLICEMAN:,The crew had gone for the day. Site was shut down.
263,DEAN:,Anything unusual besides the nails in the eyes?
263,POLICEMAN:,"Well, we're still trying to figure out where they plugged in the nail gun, seeing as there's no generator on the truck."
263,DEAN:,"Well, when you figure that out, let me know."
263,DEAN:,"So, another victim everybody likes."
263,SAM:,Not everybody.
263,DEAN:,Another physically impossible death. You got any ideas?
263,SAM:,Cirque du Soleil?
263,DEAN:,"Oh, I, uh, found another one of these, just like at the, uh, the hair-dryer/brain-roast."
263,SAM:,"And I found a connection with all the vics. Um, these e-mail logs show Wendy, the real-estate chick, uh, Carl, the architect, and this Dewey guy were all working on a shopping center project together."
263,DEAN:,Why didn't we know about that?
263,SAM:,"I- Well, it all fell apart for some reason. I mean, there are these e-mails back and forth, pretty hot and heavy, and suddenly they just stopped."
263,DEAN:,"So, everybody working on this project has died?"
263,SAM:,"Well, not yet. Um, they were working with a developer, a guy named Don Stark."
263,DEAN:,Don Stark? Why do I know that name?
263,SAM:,"Man, this Stark guy is really plugged in, huh?"
263,DEAN:,"So, all the players in this – this shopping-center project have either fried, boiled, or kebabbed. He could be next."
263,SAM:,"Really? From a freaking flask? What are you, bad Santa? On the job?"
263,DEAN:,We're always on the job.
263,SAM:,"All right. Bobby e-mailed back. I sent him a few pics of those coins you found. He says the writing is Romanian Cyrillic, used only in the mid-15th to the 19th century. Apparently, it's an antique Wallachian ducat."
263,DEAN:,"So, we're looking for an old Romanian?"
263,SAM:,"You know, is it just me, or is this really weird?"
263,DEAN:,"Huh. I've seen this once before, where t-the plants are all dead in one spot."
263,SAM:,Where?
263,DEAN:,"A bus bench with Wendy Goodson's picture on it. I mean, I'm no expert, but I don't think plants are supposed to act like this."
263,DEAN:,"It's looking that way, yes."
263,SAM:,"Now, Mr. Stark, you had a relationship with all three victims, correct?"
263,DEAN:,"And you were all involved in a, uh, a-a shopping-center project. Why'd that fall through?"
263,JENNY:,"Hi, there. Okay, Don, I'm off to the cleaner's, and then I'm gonna stop at Beaman, Beaman, and Beaman for the revised contracts."
263,JENNY:,"[laughs] Oh, I baked you some cupcakes – coconut."
263,JENNY:,I'll see you soon.
263,DEAN:,Yummy.
263,SAM:,"You know, could you point me to the restroom? I had a little bit too much java."
263,SAM:,Thanks.
263,DEAN:,"So, uh, usually in cases like these –"
263,DEAN:,You have any business rivals?
263,DEAN:,"Well, that was easy."
263,DEAN:,"""To Don – take no prisoners. D. Trump."" The Trumpster! Wow."
263,SAM:,Including your wife?
263,SAM:,"Sorry. It's just, we heard the two of you were splitting up, right?"
263,DEAN:,"Yeah, that's, uh – that's what we heard."
263,SAM:,"And how would you describe the, uh – the issues between you and your wife?"
263,SAM:,"No, I'm sorry. I don't."
263,DEAN:,"She caught you cheating, huh? I couldn't help but notice, uh, things were kind of cordial between you and your assistant. Pretty good with the ladies there, Mr. Stark? It's a blessing and a curse, isn't it?"
263,SAM:,"""Admire""?"
263,DEAN:,"A ""thing""?"
263,SAM:,Like a – like a shoe or a golf club.
263,DEAN:,Right. Like a waffle iron.
263,SAM:,Yeah.
263,DEAN:,"Yeah. No, see, Don, uh, wives generally think of an affair as something more than a thing."
263,DEAN:,"Hmm. Now, if we were to guess that the, uh, uh, business associate was Wendy Goodson, would we win the weekend trip to Maui?"
263,DEAN:,If it was an accident.
263,SAM:,"No, we're not implying anything. We're just saying... you should be careful. And take her to dinner and apologize."
263,DEAN:,"Yeah, and, uh, grovel. Wouldn't hurt."
263,SAM:,Found a bunch of hex junk in their stuff – clearly her thing. And the empty closet didn't seem like she was coming back anytime soon.
263,DEAN:,"So, Don admires Wendy, biblically, Wendy dies weird, and the scorned wife is into the dark stuff."
263,SAM:,While Don's just in the dark.
263,DEAN:,"Hmm. It's kind of like ""Bewitched."" You know, Don's Darrin, doesn't even know it. A lot of laughs until, uh, you cheat on your wife."
263,SAM:,"A ""Bewitched"" reference. Really?"
263,DEAN:,"Dude, Nicole Kidman was in the remake. Redhead. Hello!"
263,SAM:,Look at all these dead plants.
263,DEAN:,Huh. It's kind of like the real-estate lady's place and Don's statue thing.
263,SAM:,"You know, if she's strong enough, just being pissed off is enough to send some pretty bad vibes their way."
263,DEAN:,Literally kill off everything around her just by pms-ing at it. Eeh. That's not creepy at all.
263,DEAN:,He's on it.
263,DEAN:,"Don, keep it in your pants, man."
263,SAM:,Mrs. Stark.
263,SAM:,Could I have a moment?
263,SAM:,It's very important that I talk to you.
263,SAM:,I'm sorry – uh... restless leg syndrome.
263,DEAN:,Spoiler alert.
263,DEAN:,"Jenny Klein's next. Swiped her photo off a hex deck, but Maggie's gonna notice it's gone eventually. We got to get over to Jenny's."
263,DEAN:,"Find the coin, now!"
263,DEAN:,"Come on, Sam!"
263,JENNY:,"There were tiny beating hearts in my cupcakes. There were hearts in my cupcakes, hearts in my cupcakes! [becoming hysterical] That's never happened before! Hearts in my cupcakes!"
263,DEAN:,Should I slug her?
263,SAM:,Give it a second.
263,JENNY:,"Oh, my God. What just happened?"
263,SAM:,You were hexed.
263,JENNY:,Hexed? Who are you people? What the hell do I do?
263,DEAN:,"What you do is you go in there and you pack a bag, you get in your car, and you go."
263,JENNY:,Go where?
263,SAM:,"It doesn't matter. Look, 500 or 600 miles ought to do it. You got someone real powerful real pissed, and they're trying to get rid of you now. In line with that, you might want to cool things with Don Stark."
263,JENNY:,Don Stark? What are you talking about?
263,DEAN:,You and Don. You know.
263,JENNY:,"""You know""? There's no ""you know."""
263,SAM:,No?
263,JENNY:,"Don Stark is my boss. That's it. He's married, for God sakes."
263,DEAN:,"Yeah, well..."
263,JENNY:,Me and Don Stark. Ew.
263,WOMAN:,"Hey. Maggie, can you sign for the flowers? I've checked them. They're fine."
263,SUE:,"Oh, please, I like helping. What are best friends for?"
263,SUE:,"It's like he put a knife right in your heart, isn't it?"
263,SUE:,Was I wrong to tell you about him and Wendy?
263,SUE:,"I love you, too."
263,SUE:,Don.
263,SUE:,You mean the one who's divorcing you?
263,SUE:,"Oh, but they weren't lies, were they, Don?"
263,SUE:,I sincerely doubt that.
263,DEAN:,"Now she's just getting nasty. Killing the girlfriend is one thing, but his commemorative bust? That's got to hurt."
263,SAM:,"She'll take the whole town out, Dean. She don't care who gets in the way."
263,SUE:,See? I told you. Everything's perfect.
263,DEAN:,Dude. Pie.
263,DEAN:,Ugh. That is --
263,SAM:,"Chicken feet, just like the recipe calls for. Butcher's fridge is down."
263,DEAN:,I can smell that.
263,SAM:,"Uh, says the power's been wonky and that he's lost so much product, he probably won't make rent. Ditto every shop on the block – nothing but burst pipes and blackouts."
263,DEAN:,Huh.
263,SAM:,"He says it's like all of a sudden, the town ran out of luck."
263,DEAN:,"So, coincidence, right?"
263,SAM:,Uh...yeah. We're past the point of dead flowers.
263,DEAN:,"What can I say? I guess the witch is pissed. All right, let's, uh – we better get a move on here. Why don't you just..."
263,DEAN:,C-can you take the feet?
263,SAM:,Ugh.
263,SUE:,To us.
263,SUE:,That is disgusting!
263,SUE:,Maggie? What is going on?
263,SUE:,Do you mean Don? Don rigged all this?
263,SUE:,But how?
263,SUE:,"I told you – he's a dick. But we'll get through this because you have people who love you, and he can't take that away from you."
263,DEAN:,What the hell?
263,DEAN:,Whoa. Clean-up on aisle 7.
263,SAM:,"Okay, I don't guess she'd do this to her own auction."
263,DEAN:,"No, obviously it was someone who hated her guts and wanted her party trashed."
263,SAM:,Don Stark.
263,DEAN:,"So, the mister's a witch, himself. That means we got not just one pissed-off witch. We've got two. It's full-on ""War of the Roses."""
263,SAM:,"""Bewitched"" just got a lot less funny."
263,DEAN:,It's like when they switched Darrins.
263,SAM:,Where is she?
263,DEAN:,She'll be here. They've been throwing thunderbolts at each other's favorite toys. There's nothing left to destroy but each other. This is basically ground zero.
263,SAM:,I hope so. We're gonna need them both in the same place if we're gonna take them down.
263,DEAN:,"Screens up, Captain."
263,DEAN:,Furor divina virtute in infernum eam detrude!
263,SAM:,"Okay, plan B."
263,DEAN:,What's plan B?
263,SAM:,Talking.
263,DEAN:,Now? Really?
263,SAM:,"This is obviously a domestic dispute. So if you can't kill them, counsel them."
263,DEAN:,Yeah. You know what? Not my area!
263,DEAN:,"Okay, okay, okay. Uh..."
263,DEAN:,"Look – obviously, you two are capable of wiping each other out, right? But you haven't, huh? Which means that you two – you still value whatever it is you got. A-and you want keep that dance going. Maybe it's – maybe it's punishment. Maybe it's – it's sick, messed-up, erotic, kinky, clamps and feathers kind of love."
263,SAM:,"Okay, okay, t-that's – that's going way too deep, there, cowboy. Look, what he's trying to say is that – is that you two – whatever it is you have, you're bonded."
263,SAM:,"We're not trying to say what Don did was right. When a relationship cracks, usually both parties have a hand in it."
263,SAM:,Ugh!
263,DEAN:,"Whoa! Okay, okay! Okay, look – n-nobody can defend Don. Right? Uh, totally. But, uh, we get that you feel betrayed...because you were."
263,SAM:,"Okay, okay, look --"
263,SAM:,I got to say I-I don't think Don was lying when he said he regrets the whole Wendy thing.
263,SAM:,"Aagh! Ugh! Yeah, affair – that's right, terrible."
263,DEAN:,"That's true. She, uh – she told us – just an assistant."
263,DEAN:,Whoa!
263,SAM:,"See? See? Guys, guys... You're talking."
263,SAM:,"All these years, you – you – you buried your anger and your disappointment till it tore you apart. All you needed to do was talk."
263,DEAN:,"And I would have missed the nuking that my melon just took. Well, who wants that?"
263,DEAN:,Somebody want to call these things off? Ex-- excuse me!
263,DEAN:,"Oh, give me a break."
263,SAM:,I didn't say anything.
263,DEAN:,It's been a long day.
263,CHET:,And it's not over yet.
263,CHET:,"Hi, Sam. Hi, Dean."
263,SAM:,Do we know you?
263,CHET:,"Well, I definitely know you. You're the dead guys. Well, you will be in a minute."
263,CHET:,Sorry. You're a bit outmatched.
263,DEAN:,"Don. Well, thank you. We owe you."
263,SAM:,I guess we should be figuring that out.
263,DEAN:,It is on our to-do list.
263,SAM:,"Uh, what are you even doing here?"
263,SAM:,Maggie? Seriously?
263,DEAN:,She was gonna kill us? We just saved your damn marriage.
263,DEAN:,We should hit the road. You ready?
263,SAM:,"Hey, were you, um, were you listening to the Starks tonight?"
263,DEAN:,"Uh, a little, when I wasn't getting slammed into a wall or stung by bees."
263,SAM:,"You notice how they, uh, you know, how they – how they opened up, got everything off their chest?"
263,DEAN:,Yeah. Kudos on selling them that crap.
263,SAM:,"It wasn't crap, Dean. It worked."
263,DEAN:,"Sam, I am so very, very, very, very...very, very tired --"
263,SAM:,"Dean, like it or not, the stuff you don't talk about doesn't just go away. It builds up, like whatever's eating at you right now."
263,DEAN:,"There's always something eating at me. That's who I am. Something happens, I feel responsible, all right? The Lindbergh baby – that's on me. Unemployment – my bad."
263,SAM:,That's not what I'm talking about.
263,DEAN:,"Well, then what the hell are you talking about?"
263,SAM:,"I'm talking about whatever you're not telling me about. Look, Dean, it's fine. You can unload. That's kind of what I'm here for."
263,SAM:,"I mean... we're good, right?"
263,DEAN:,We're good.
264,SAM:,You sure about this?
264,DEAN:,Trust me.
264,DEAN:,"Good morning... Megan. That is a really, really pretty dress."
264,MEGAN:,Oh!
264,MEGAN:,Thank you. It's vintage.
264,DEAN:,"Well, it looks new on you."
264,MEGAN:,"Aren't you sweet, sir?"
264,DEAN:,Call me Dean.
264,MEGAN:,"How can I help you today, Dean?"
264,DEAN:,"Um, well, I don't actually have an account at this bank, but I was wondering if there was any way..."
264,DEAN:,...I could get change for that?
264,MEGAN:,I think I can make an exception... just for you.
264,DEAN:,Thanks.
264,MEGAN:,"How do you want it, Dean?"
264,DEAN:,"[laughs] Well, I'm gonna have to take a rain check... and all your money."
264,SAM:,"Hands in the air! Hands in the air! Your money's insured, so no heroes, okay?"
264,DEAN:,Get in there!
264,SAM:,You ready?
264,DEAN:,Yep.
264,BOBBY:,"Okay, Chet. Let's see how you like a little fruit of the poison tree."
264,CHET:,Isn't that just a legal expression?
264,BOBBY:,You're gonna wish it was.
264,CHET:,Hmm.
264,CHET:,"Okay. Similar finish to holy water, not as bitter as rock salt."
264,CHET:,And how are my two favorite meat-sicles?
264,DEAN:,Is he still sucking air?
264,BOBBY:,Greatest hits didn't do the trick. I'm down to B-sides and deep cuts.
264,DEAN:,"Well, you better figure out something quick. That whammy that witch dude put on him is only gonna last for a few days. He gets his spinach back, we're gonna end up having to drop a car on him just to stop him."
264,CHET:,"Actually... Edgar walked away from that car. He's fine. Well, he is a little pissed at you, but -- Oh. You didn't know?"
264,DEAN:,Why don't you shut your cake-trap?
264,CHET:,Ooh.
264,SAM:,Bobby... You've been using all this stuff and he still won't talk?
264,CHET:,"Huddle over, coach?"
264,DEAN:,How'd you find us?
264,CHET:,It was easy. I used pattern-recognition software and a basic heuristic algorithm to track your known aliases.
264,BOBBY:,Great. Just what we need -- a Mensa monster.
264,SAM:,All right. Let's just start with the start. Where'd you get our aliases?
264,CHET:,"From your trench-coated friend, obviously. When we were all nestled in at Camp Cas, kind of got
the full download. That's just how we do."
264,BOBBY:,"So why are you talking to us, Chet? You're not dumb. Why you spilling state secrets?"
264,CHET:,"'Cause I'm not scared of you. You can't stop me. You can't stop any of us. We can't be killed, you stupid little chewtoys. You are aware that I'm the least of your concerns, right? Oh. You haven't watched the news today, have you?"
264,BOBBY:,"Busy morning, you two?"
264,DEAN:,Those sons of bitches xeroxed us.
264,SAM:,But I don't understand how.
264,BOBBY:,I don't know.
264,BOBBY:,Maybe one of 'em touched you at the hospital.
264,CHET:,"Not too hard to lift some DNA out of a motel shower drain, guys!"
264,DEAN:,You can copy people like that?
264,DEAN:,"Awesome. Well, what is their plan, exactly?"
264,SAM:,Squeeze us. Turn us into the most wanted men in America.
264,DEAN:,"All right. Well, that settles it. We find these ass monkeys, and we kill them ourselves."
264,BOBBY:,Wait a sec. Every form of law enforcement in the country has seen your ugly mugs this morning.
264,DEAN:,Exactly. So what's the point in trying to hide?
264,BOBBY:,Better than sticking your fool neck out. These things are smarter than you.
264,BOBBY:,"You don't have a clue how to kill 'em or slow 'em down, and your plan is, what? Go right at 'em? Genius."
264,DEAN:,"They're wearing our faces, Bobby. This is personal."
264,SAM:,"Yeah, I'm with Dean here."
264,BOBBY:,"Well, if you're gonna be stupid, you might as well be smart about it. You need to see a fella named Frank Devereaux."
264,SAM:,Who's he?
264,BOBBY:,"He's a jackass and a lunatic, but he owes me one, from back in Port Huron."
264,BOBBY:,"In the meantime, I'll keep working on Chatty Cathy here, see if I can figure out what makes him die."
264,SAM:,The usual?
264,DEAN:,Rhymes with sing-songs.
264,SAM:,You guys sell protein bars?
264,CLERK:,Yeah.
264,CLERK:,"But it's in -- it's in the back, though. Just, uh, give me a second."
264,SAM:,Sure. Thanks.
264,SAM:,Pretty sure the cashier just made me. Drive.
264,SHERIFF:,"Gentlemen. These Winchester boys are keeping busy, I hear. What is this, some type of psycho road trip?"
264,SHERIFF:,"The second bank, plus that convenience store?"
264,SHERIFF:,Excuse me.
264,DEAN:,You sure this is the right place?
264,SAM:,Yeah.
264,SAM:,"Frank, you in there? Frank?"
264,SAM:,Frank?
264,SAM:,"Frank? Frank, anybody here? Hello? Anybody home?"
264,FRANK:,"Well, well. Spider caught some flies."
264,FRANK:,"Well, I'll be darned. Psycho Butch and Sundance. You're on CNN right now."
264,SAM:,"No, no, t-that's not us."
264,FRANK:,I know. Can't be. Unless you had a teleporter. Do you have a teleporter?
264,SAM:,"No, sir. We don't."
264,FRANK:,"Well, my condolences on the doppelgangers. Now, who sent you? NSA? The Feeb? March of Dimes?"
264,DEAN:,"Uh, Bobby Singer sent us."
264,DEAN:,Or not. Who?
264,SAM:,"H-he said you could help. He said you owed him, from Port Huron."
264,DEAN:,"That's usually how it works, yeah."
264,FRANK:,"Oh, yeah. I know that Bobby's into that magic hooey, but truth is, the government have been cloning people for years. Guess it was just your turn in the barrel."
264,SAM:,"Well, actually --"
264,DEAN:,Forget it. He's rolling.
264,FRANK:,Yours have been busy beavers. You're number two on the most wanted list. Quickest climb up the charts since Donna Summer.
264,SAM:,"So, what do you think we should do?"
264,FRANK:,Cuba's nice this time of year.
264,DEAN:,"No, we're not hiding."
264,DEAN:,"Look, we, uh –"
264,DEAN:,"We go to stick around and kick a couple asses. So, we just need you to get us further off the grid, but keep us on the board."
264,FRANK:,"Well, first thing we got to do is wipe all your old aliases. No more rock shoutouts. It's Tom and John Smith from now on. And no plastic. Cash only. And change your phones on a..."
264,FRANK:,"...very frequent non-schedule schedule, you understand? Oh, and try to stay out of view of the 200 million cameras that the government has access to, 'kay?"
264,DEAN:,200 million?
264,FRANK:,"Big Brother, he has many eyeballs, my friend. You see a place that even looks like it can afford  security..."
264,FRANK:,"you just ease on down the road. This... this is your laptop, right?"
264,SAM:,Yeah. That's mine.
264,SAM:,What -- gee -- hey -- what are you -- what was that?!
264,SAM:,"Uh... Thank you, I guess."
264,FRANK:,"No problem. You owe me five grand, cash."
264,SAM:,What?
264,DEAN:,What?
264,FRANK:,"Unless you wanna go comparison shop at the mall, sweet cheeks. Say hi to the cops for me. Okay."
264,FRANK:,"Let's Blue Steel you up some new I.D., Mr..."
264,FRANK:,...and Mr...
264,FRANK:,...Smith.
264,CHET:,"Whoo! Do it again! Come on, do it again!"
264,CHET:,"So you're just gonna touch me in the morning, then just walk away?"
264,BOBBY:,Are you still talkin'?
264,CHET:,Aren't you sick of this yet?
264,BOBBY:,"You bleed. Black...snot, sure, but you bleed, you can die."
264,CHET:,"Sure, sport, whatever you say. Try the acid again, why don't you? Poor sap. You're stumped."
264,BOBBY:,"Give it a rest, mouthy."
264,CHET:,"How long you think these'll hold once the spell wears off, hmm? Tick tock, old man. I'm gonna really enjoy eating you, right down to that hat."
264,BOBBY:,I said shut up.
264,CHET:,And then I'm gonna eat everyone you ever said hello to.
264,BOBBY:,"Hot damn. Well, that's somethin'."
264,FRANK:,I marked all the towns your stunt doubles hit so you can see the pattern.
264,SAM:,"All right, great. Um, so, what is the pattern?"
264,FRANK:,"No clue, man. I can't see it."
264,SAM:,Seems random.
264,FRANK:,"Little tip from a pro -- there is no such thing as a random series of robbery murders by your evil twins. Well, have yourself some uppers and look at that some more."
264,FRANK:,Good luck.
264,SAM:,"Thanks, Frank."
264,FRANK:,"For what? Sending you to your death? Your doubles want to be on candid camera, put you in the line of fire. Now, I'd lay low, 'cause I love life and its infinite mysteries. But you two want to be dumb, that's fine. At least have the common sense to ditch your car."
264,DEAN:,"Wh -- uh, excuse me -- what?"
264,FRANK:,Your doublemints --  they're using a car just like the one outside.
264,BOBBY:,What the... What the hell are you doing here?
264,BOBBY:,So my therapist keeps telling me. How'd you find me?
264,BOBBY:,"Well, you may not want me to. I got one of the big mouths downstairs."
264,BOBBY:,Thank me?
264,BOBBY:,"Oh, that. Just doing my job, which nobody pays me for."
264,BOBBY:,I'm fine. Every day is a gift.
264,BOBBY:,"As you can see, I got a roof over me."
264,BOBBY:,"Okay. Thanks, Sheriff."
264,CHET:,Did you think it would be that easy?
264,BOBBY:,No. But it's a start.
264,CHET:,Ugh.
264,SAM:,You okay?
264,DEAN:,"You know, it's bad enough that they're ganking people, wearing our mugs, but now this? Have us driving around in this... this caboodle while Baby's on lockdown."
264,SAM:,"It's temporary, Dean."
264,DEAN:,Nobody puts Baby in a corner.
264,SAM:,Y-you know that's a line from --
264,DEAN:,Swayze movie. Swayze always gets a pass!
264,SAM:,"Right. Uh, well, you want some tunes or something? Here."
264,SAM:,"Sorry, man, I-I..."
264,DEAN:,Just leave it. Probably gonna be the only thing on.
264,SAM:,Here.
264,SAM:,Dean.
264,DEAN:,What?
264,SAM:,Jericho -- the lady in white.
264,SAM:,Blackwater -- wendigo. Lake Manitoc -- the kid in the lake.
264,DEAN:,They're hitting towns we've worked jobs in.
264,SAM:,In order. Since the day I left Stanford with you.
264,DEAN:,"So, what, they want us to find them?"
264,SAM:,"Well, one way to find out -- next case would be in...St. Louis."
264,DEAN:,"Perfect. Connor's Diner. Best burgers in St. Louis. Oh, I deserve something good in my life right now."
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"You know, he has one of these..."
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"...every day. And in his heart, he thinks they're almost as good as sex. This..."
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,...is disgusting.
264,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,"Dead plants with creamy goo. It's like eating self-righteousness. I mean, you tell me which is worse."
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"I mean, honestly, I just... You know what? I can't stand the guy. Talk about a hero complex. And he doesn't have relationships. No, he has applications for sainthood. Oh, and he thinks he's funny. He thinks he's a damn comedian."
264,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,Who has two thumbs and full-blown bats in the belfry?
264,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,"I'm serious. It's nothing but Satan-vision on the inside. I mean, how he's walking around in a jacket with detachable arms is beyond me. You know, I had a brother with this many issues once."
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Yeah?
264,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,Know what I did?
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Hmm?
264,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,I ate him.
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Of course you did.
264,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,How are these guys even a threat?
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"Boss says they gotta go, they gotta go."
264,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,"Right. Idea. You wanna trade? I mean, I'll take Chuckles over Schizo."
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"No, I like this one's hair better. You can stay in the big one."
264,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,"All right. In that case, let's turn up the heat. The sooner I get out of this and into something more stable, the better."
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Hold on.
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"Hey, kid. Hey. Why don't you fire up the camera on that thing?"
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Point it over here.
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Shall we?
264,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,"All right, everybody be cool! This is a robbery!"
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"Anybody moves, and I'll execute every last one of you!"
264,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,"Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Keep that up! I didn't say you could put that down! I want the whole world to know what Sam and Dean Winchester are capable of."
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,That all of 'em?
264,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,All but one.
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"Well, goodnight, St. Louis. You've been a wonderful crowd. Grab your socks and hose, Iowa, 'cause we're headed to you next."
264,CHET:,Ooh.
264,BOBBY:,Balls.
264,CHET:,"It's pretty dark in here. High-school dropout. A drunk like your daddy before you. Oh. You and Dad. Now, that's a can of scorpions. Your favorite singer is Joni frickin' Mitchell? Oh, Bobby. You are 10 pounds of sad in a 5-pound bag."
264,DEAN:,"Sam, Sam. Hold up. Don't move. Don't move."
264,SAM:,"Oh, no. This is all sorts of wrong."
264,DEAN:,"Those are nice wheels. Tell you what, when this is over, I'm stealing those rims."
264,CHET:,Tell the kids I said hi.
264,SHERIFF:,Hands in the air!
264,DEAN:,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
264,DEAN:,Big misunderstanding.
264,DEAN:,"Look, the guys you want --"
264,SHERIFF:,Shut up!
264,DEAN:,They're right there.
264,SHERIFF:,Shut up! Drop the phone. Put your hands in the air.
264,SHERIFF:,Cuff ’em.
264,CHET:,"You know the thing about you, Bobby..."
264,BOBBY:,"Save it. I already know me, handsome."
264,CHET:,"You got the gruff thing down. Seen more death than an electric chair. Ready to die with your boots on. But, you know, deep down inside... you're no cynic. You still hope. You even got a thing for that lady upstairs. Tiny part of you thinks, maybe... after this is all done, you and Miss Sheriff can make your own little cabin in the woods."
264,CHET:,"That's hilarious. You're not getting any older than tomorrow, Bobby. Why do you bother?"
264,BOBBY:,You a Browning fan?
264,CHET:,Come again?
264,BOBBY:,Robert Browning. Poet. You got that name rattling around up there with the rest of my thoughts and feelings?
264,CHET:,"It's kind of hard to sift through all the drunken blackouts, but --"
264,BOBBY:,"""A man's reach should exceed his grasp."""
264,CHET:,"I like that. That's actually lovely. Browning? After I eat you, I'm definitely gonna hit the library."
264,CHET:,What the hell is that?
264,CHET:,Get it off. Get it off! Get it off!!
264,CHET:,Get it off of me!
264,CHET:,Aaargh! Get it off me!
264,BOBBY:,What the hell was in that bucket?
264,SAM:,"Look, you're making a mistake. The real killers are back at the diner, okay?"
264,SHERIFF:,Is that the best you can do?
264,DEAN:,I want my phone call.
264,SHERIFF:,"Oh, there'll be a call, to the FBI. Take him [indicates DEAN] to cell number one. Take that one [indicates SAM] to the interview room. Once they're separate and secure, you boys call it a night."
264,SAM:,You're making a mistake!
264,DEAN:,Hey. I have a right to my phone call.
264,SHERIFF:,"A right? You killed how many people last couple days, and you want me to hop-to on your rights?"
264,DEAN:,I didn't -- please -- just give me one -- one phone call.
264,DEAN:,What'd you do that for?
264,SHERIFF:,Borax? Decapitation? What kind of sickos are you and your friends?
264,DEAN:,"Hey, you listen to me."
264,DEAN:,"If you don't go get every ounce, every drop of whatever that stuff is in this place right now, we're all gonna die!"
264,SHERIFF:,"Well, you're crazier than I thought."
264,DEAN:,Hey!
264,DEAN:,What is it? What happened?
264,SHERIFF:,I...It's just... I don't know what I just saw.
264,DEAN:,"Let me out of here. Okay, you listen to me, and we'll live. All right, keep your head down, get to the supply closet. Get anything that says Borax on it -- bring it here. Now. Go."
264,SAM:,Dean!
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,I'm not your brother. But I am Dean adjacent.
264,DEAN:,Sorry.
264,DEAN:,Sammy.
264,DEAN:,Not Sammy.
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"I just want to let you know how much I've really grown to hate you and your brother since we've been wearing you. I just don't get it. You could be anything. You're strong, you're uninhibited. 
You're smart enough, believe it or not. But you're so caught up in being good and taking care of each other."
264,SAM:,What do you care?
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Because it pisses me off! You're wasting a perfectly good opportunity to subjugate the weak.
264,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,Cute. Really think you can get close enough to use it?
264,DEAN:,Not until you're burning.
264,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,Aargh! Aargh!
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Dean... thinks you're nutballs. He thinks you're off your game.
264,SAM:,"You gonna kill me, or is this some sort of ""play with your food"" bull?"
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"All right. All right. You know, I guess that's why Dean never told you that he killed Amy."
264,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"There it is. The look on your face. That is priceless! That's what I've been waiting for. Now I can eat you. 'Cause, you see, I like my meat a little bitter."
264,DEAN:,"Well, that felt good."
264,SHERIFF:,So... the FBI is on the way.
264,DEAN:,"Yeah, listen, about that..."
264,SHERIFF:,Whatever I can do... Especially if it involves lying about everything I just saw.
264,DEAN:,"Good. I was hoping you could help us kind of...be dead. You know, quote unquote."
264,SHERIFF:,"Yeah. Yeah, I should be able to swing that. All right."
264,DEAN:,"Come on, let's grab a mop."
264,DEAN:,Sammy? You okay?
264,SAM:,"Yeah, I'm fine."
264,DEAN:,Let's go.
264,SHERIFF:,That's when I got the drop on them and shot them both.
264,CORONER:,"Here's the files. Cause of death -- multiple gunshot wounds. I fingerprinted them first, of course, for your records."
264,SHERIFF:,"Their bodies were sent to the funeral home for cremation, as per their living wills and religious requirements."
264,SHERIFF:,"You can contact the funeral home. They might still have the bodies. As you know, once we do the autopsy, we're obliged to release --"
264,BOBBY:,"For now. Thanks, Jody. Couldn't have done it without you."
264,BOBBY:,"Actually, there is one more thing."
264,BOBBY:,"Don't open it. Even if it starts talking. Especially if it starts talking. When you cross over Underhill Bridge, just toss it in the drink. If you'll excuse me, I, um...I got a body to bury in cement."
264,CORONER:,"Dad, seriously? Lying to the FBI, incinerating bodies, and this stuff? What the hell is it? 'Cause it sure isn't blood."
264,SHERIFF:,I can explain.
264,CROWLEY:,Mr. Roman.
264,CROWLEY:,I felt it was time we met in person. I'm Crowley. I run Hell.
264,CROWLEY:,A token.
264,CROWLEY:,100% organic baby uvulas – gluten free.
264,CROWLEY:,"I'll cut to the chase, Mr. Roman."
264,CROWLEY:,"Dick. You and I control large interests that I feel strongly could meld, to the benefit of all."
264,CROWLEY:,"I know. Straight talk – we should be friends, you and I."
264,CROWLEY:,"Well, I brought you here... Dick. I found the way to open the door to Purgatory."
264,CROWLEY:,I think you've got me wrong.
264,CROWLEY:,Keep the muffins.
264,DEAN:,Are you sure you want to dump these things? I'm thinking they might actually come in handy down the road. What do you think?
264,DEAN:,Hey. What? What is it? Talk.
264,SAM:,Nothing.
264,DEAN:,"Well, that's convincing. Did monster-us give you the jeebs, huh? 'Cause I gotta be honest – I ain't looking in the mirror for – for a while myself."
264,SAM:,Okay. You really want to know what's wrong?
264,DEAN:,"Yeah. Yeah, you know my – here to help."
264,SAM:,"""Here to help."" Kind of like you helped Amy?"
264,DEAN:,"Listen, Sam..."
264,SAM:,"Don't – don't lie to me again. No, don't even talk to me. Yeah, I can't."
264,SAM:,"You know what, Dean?"
264,SAM:,I can't.
264,DEAN:,You can't what?
264,SAM:,I can't talk to you right now! Dean...
264,SAM:,I can't even be around you right now!
264,DEAN:,"Okay, so—"
264,SAM:,I think you should just go on without me.
264,SAM:,Go.
264,DEAN:,"All right. Sorry, Sam."
265,MEDIUM:,"Yes. A spirit has gathered around us. Are you with us, spirit?"
265,WOMAN:,I feel something. I have goose bumps. Uncle Danny?
265,MEDIUM:,We're going to make contact now. Rest your hands on the planchette.
265,MEDIUM:,Let the spirit guide our hands.
265,MEDIUM:,"O spirit, are you the one we seek? Are you... Uncle Danny?"
265,WOMAN:,I'm not doing that.
265,MAN:,Yeah. She's pushing it.
265,MEDIUM:,It's okay to be skeptical.
265,MEDIUM:,"Danny, if you're with us, knock twice for yes."
265,WOMAN:,"Danny? Can you ask him, is he happy?"
265,MEDIUM:,He is. He's happy.
265,WOMAN:,Is Sadie with him?
265,MAN:,"Now you're being ridiculous, Cynthia. Who cares about Sadie?"
265,MEDIUM:,"Ah, yes. I see... A family pet."
265,CYNTHIA:,That's her. Sadie was a Schnauzer.
265,MEDIUM:,"She's with Danny, chasing tennis balls in the afterlife."
265,CYNTHIA:,Sadie loved tennis balls.
265,MAN:,There were important papers. No one can find them. They weren't in the safe. Can you just ask him...
265,MEDIUM:,Of course. I'll need you to place your hands with me on the planchette.
265,MEDIUM:,Maybe – maybe Danny didn't like the question.
265,MAN:,Tell him to quit fooling around. He knows darn well that's my money.
265,CYNTHIA:,"Can't you two stop squabbling? For Pete's sake, he's dead. Tell him we're sorry. Maybe if we're nice, he'll –"
265,CYNTHIA:,"Oh, my God. Danny?"
265,CYNTHIA:,What's going on?
265,DEAN:,Geez. Have some pride.
265,DEAN:,Yeah.
265,DEAN:,"The hell I am, ass-hat."
265,DEAN:,O spirits of the further... am I going to win the Powerball?
265,DEAN:,I'm gonna be rich!
265,WAITER:,Hello! First time at Good Graces?
265,DEAN:,Yes.
265,WAITER:,"Well, we're 100% locally sourced, biodynamic, and you get a free affirmation with every order."
265,DEAN:,Think I'll source a taco joint.
265,WAITER:,All right.
265,SAM:,"Just coffee, black, extra shot."
265,DEAN:,You always wear a suit to get your palm read?
265,DEAN:,Yeah. Not surprised you caught this one. It's on every morning zoo in America. You mind?
265,DEAN:,"So, I, uh, I went to the scene. Wires, speakers, enough E.M.F. to make your hair stand up. Don't even think about getting a reading. Oh, and, uh, if this hadn't have been two psychics that bit it... I would have just chalked this up as being, uh, dumb and accidental. And I know, I know. This whole town's supposedly calling ghosts. But that takes some serious spellwork and some serious mojo. The only books this lady had were Oprah crap. When was the last time you actually saw a real psychic? Huh? Pamela? Missouri? Anyway, this [DEAN gestures towards SAM] is good. And, uh, how you been?"
265,WAITER:,And what can I get for you?
265,DEAN:,"Uh, pancakes, side of pig. Coffee, black."
265,WAITER:,Fantastic. You are a virile manifestation of the divine.
265,DEAN:,What the hell did he say to me?
265,DEAN:,"Oh, it's funny? Yeah, no. Go ahead. Laugh it up, Sam. Hilarious."
265,SAM:,Dean...
265,DEAN:,"Oh, he speaks."
265,SAM:,Look...
265,DEAN:,"Sam. Look, we're both here. All right, the chance of either one of us leaving while people are still dying out there—"
265,DEAN:,You might as well bite the bullet and work with me on this one.
265,SAM:,I don't know if I can.
265,DEAN:,"I'm not asking you to open up a can of worms, okay, I'm not even asking you where the hell you've been for the past week and a half."
265,SAM:,Good.
265,DEAN:,"I'm just saying, let's try and stop the killings. That's it."
265,SAM:,Okay.
265,DEAN:,Okay? Good.
265,DEAN:,Can I help you?
265,WOMAN:,You're the brothers from the—
265,SAM:,"Oh, no, no, no, no. The Winchester guys on the news a couple weeks back? No – we get that a lot."
265,DEAN:,"Yeah, no. Those depraved killers got put down like the dogs that they were. Us on the other hand, we're completely harmless."
265,WOMAN:,"Oh, yeah! I'm sorry. Silly me. And I can see by your energies, you're completely gentle."
265,MAN:,"Excuse my friend. She's excitable. Sweetheart, look at them, hmm? They're FBI."
265,WOMAN:,Oh!
265,MAN:,I'm Russian. We can spot the law. You must be here about the tragedies.
265,WOMAN:,"Oh, we're just beside ourselves about what happened."
265,DEAN:,"Yeah. And so close to festival season, huh?"
265,WOMAN:,Yeah – no—
265,MAN:,"Of course we are worried. We have no idea what's going on, huh?"
265,MAN:,Nikolai. Let me know if I can help you. I'm highly intuitive.
265,SAM:,"Nikolai Lishin, spoon bender?"
265,NIKOLAI:,Mm. World famous.
265,NIKOLAI:,"Come to my demonstration at the festival, huh?"
265,NIKOLAI:,I teach you to harness the power of your mind.
265,NIKOLAI:,"Come, let's leave them be."
265,DEAN:,"So glad we decided to vacation here, huh? Right?"
265,SAM:,All right. Here we go. First death... second death.
265,DEAN:,What am I looking at?
265,SAM:,"Well, see this? Now, this is Imelda Graven, death number one. She was brained by her own crystal ball."
265,DEAN:,"Bummer, and ironic."
265,DEAN:,Same necklace?
265,SAM:,"Yeah. See, Imelda gave it to Goldy in her will."
265,DEAN:,"Okay, so, cursed object, maybe?"
265,SAM:,"Worth looking into. Goldy's next of kin lives in town, also a psychic."
265,DEAN:,"Oh, good. I haven't had my fill."
265,SAM:,He broke my spoon.
265,DEAN:,Melanie Golden? Hi. Uh...Got a minute?
265,MELANIE:,"No, that's okay."
265,MELANIE:,"Thanks for stopping by, hon."
265,MELANIE:,"A friend. She just heard about my grandmother... which is, I guess, why you guys are here, so come on in."
265,MELANIE:,Sorry. I just got back.
265,DEAN:,You were out of town?
265,MELANIE:,"Yeah, I work the circuit – hotels, conventions, you know."
265,DEAN:,"Oh. Wait. No offense, but... you don't seem all that psychic."
265,MELANIE:,Why do you say that?
265,DEAN:,"Well, I mean, just, you know, where's all the... crystals and pyramids?"
265,MELANIE:,I'm off the clock. Also not psychic. What? It's an honest living.
265,DEAN:,"Interesting definition of ""honest."""
265,MELANIE:,"Well, I honestly read people. It's just less whoo-whoo, more body language. Like you two – long-time partners, but, um... a lot of tension. [Gestures to SAM.] You're pissed. [Gestures to DEAN.] And you're stressed. It's not brain surgery. It's kind of why my grandma and me didn't get along. I mean, she'd go full smoke-machine, but she still actually believed in all that stuff, so..."
265,DEAN:,You don't?
265,MELANIE:,You do?
265,DEAN:,I've got an open mind. You'd be surprised.
265,MELANIE:,Hmm.
265,SAM:,"I'm sorry to have to ask, b-but there's a necklace of your grandmother's."
265,MELANIE:,Don't have it. Everything went straight to the emporium. She had a deal with the owner.
265,SAM:,The emporium?
265,MAN:,Mmm. Mmm. You're looking... for something.
265,DEAN:,You're good.
265,SAM:,You Jimmy Tomorrow?
265,JIMMY:,Mm-hmm.
265,SAM:,We're looking for a necklace.
265,JIMMY:,Oh. Romantic.
265,SAM:,It would have come in with Grandma Goldy's effects.
265,JIMMY:,"Oh. Yes, yes. Now, you do know that this is the Orb of Thessaly."
265,DEAN:,We did not know.
265,JIMMY:,"Very powerful, very rare."
265,DEAN:,Let me guess. Very expensive.
265,JIMMY:,Worth every penny.
265,DEAN:,"Well, in that case..."
265,DEAN:,...we'll be taking the state's-evidence discount.
265,JIMMY:,What's going on?
265,SAM:,A murder investigation that we'd like to personally thank you for not obstructing.
265,JIMMY:,"You know, I give private energetic readings."
265,SAM:,"No, thanks."
265,JIMMY:,"A loss weighs on you. You're angry. It's complicated. Come see me, Agent."
265,DEAN:,"Thanks, Jimmy. We'll see you."
265,JIMMY:,"The bureau's gonna reimburse me for the necklace, right?"
265,DEAN:,"Oh, we'll send you a check."
265,JIMMY:,Right.
265,DEAN:,"Went a little ""Mentalist"" on you there, didn't he?"
265,DEAN:,All right. Next question. What's an Orb of Thessaly?
265,SAM:,I know one thing – it's made in Taiwan.
265,DEAN:,"Oh, a fake, around here. Imagine that. 'Course, that means that whatever's killing mediums is still out there."
265,DEAN:,He probably should have bent those with the power of his mind.
265,SAM:,Chief. We met at the station.
265,SAM:,"Morning. Uh, this is Agent Borne. So, what happened?"
265,DEAN:,All right. We're gonna take a look around. Let us know if you get any leads.
265,DEAN:,What's the popular theory?
265,DEAN:,Policing Lily Dale sounds fun.
265,SAM:,"So, these clairvoyants, did they give any details as to why they thought it was a ghost? Or a... Russian ogre?"
265,DEAN:,Excuse me.
265,MELANIE:,"I hadn't checked it until today. I mean, the only person who ever called my landline was my grandma."
265,SAM:,That's okay. Go on.
265,MELANIE:,"Look, I wouldn't put any stock in it. I mean, she was always calling me with some crazy dream she was sure was a sign, that kind of thing, but...uh, is it true Nikolai had a real vision of his death?"
265,DEAN:,That's what we were told.
265,MELANIE:,"Well, so did she – the day she died."
265,DEAN:,What'd she say?
265,MELANIE:,"Well, you can listen to it if you want. She said she was in a séance, then the lights go, it's freezing."
265,SAM:,"Wait, she said that? That the room got cold?"
265,MELANIE:,Yeah. Why? Is that important?
265,MELANIE:,What? What is it?
265,DEAN:,A ghost. The real deal.
265,MELANIE:,Come on. You're serious.
265,DEAN:,"Yeah. See, there's, uh, fake whoo-whoo crap, and there's real whoo-whoo crap."
265,MELANIE:,"Well, yeah, but... ghosts?"
265,DEAN:,"Oh, trust me. There's a lot weirder out there than that."
265,MELANIE:,"So ""The X-files"" is real, or you just stopped talking like an FBI agent."
265,SAM:,"Well, um... we're not FBI agents."
265,MELANIE:,I need a drink.
265,DEAN:,I support that.
265,DEAN:,"You know, if this is a spirit, it ain't your average spook tied to a house. I mean, this thing is boogieing all over town."
265,SAM:,Not surprised.
265,SAM:,"I mean, how many crystal balls do you figure there are in Lily Dale?"
265,DEAN:,"Somewhere between 50 and, uh, all of them."
265,SAM:,"Well, I mean, quartz can act as an antenna for spirits, right? I mean, that's why mediums started using crystal balls in the first place."
265,DEAN:,"Well, that means that every storefront in town has got a ghost satellite dish."
265,SAM:,Exactly. And this place is packed with people summoning spirits.
265,DEAN:,"Yeah, but, dude, most of these guys can't even call a taxi."
265,SAM:,All it takes is one.
265,DEAN:,That's gonna be like looking for a needle in a stack of fake needles.
265,SAM:,"It's worse. I mean, I'll bet you anything some of these guys got real juice. I'm not talking kill-people level. I'm just saying, enough to make it complicated."
265,DEAN:,"I hate this town. All right, so..."
265,DEAN:,... what? Start hitting up the Miss Cleos?
265,SAM:,I was thinking split up and canvass. It's faster.
265,DEAN:,Right. 'Course you were.
265,CUSTOMER:,What is it? My brother? Is he going back to prison?
265,CUSTOMER:,"Thank you, Sister Thibodeaux."
265,MELANIE:,"It's okay. Like I said on the phone, he can help."
265,DEAN:,"Yeah, 'cause nobody can relate to phony around here."
265,DEAN:,"All right. What happened, exactly?"
265,DEAN:,What's coming? Did you get a look?
265,DEAN:,Okay. We'll figure it out. The vision happened in here?
265,DEAN:,There any chance good-lookin' was watching?
265,MELANIE:,What the hell?!
265,MELANIE:,"Oh, my God."
265,MELANIE:,"W-was that, I mean, an actual—"
265,DEAN:,"Bona fide. Yeah. Well, no offense, but nobody's having psychic visions around here. This, uh, spirit, whoever she is, is giving them out."
265,DEAN:,"Until we stop her. Well, the good news is you said you saw a clock and it read 2 a.m., so that gives us a little time. Now, does anybody recognize this chick?"
265,MELANIE:,"You know, I swear I've seen her, like in a painting or something."
265,DEAN:,"A painting? Like, a—"
265,MELANIE:,"No, not a painting. In one of those old photos in the museum."
265,DEAN:,Why is that?
265,SAM:,Yes. Who are they?
265,DEAN:,"So, full of crap."
265,DEAN:,"So, what happened to them?"
265,SAM:,Lived here and died here?
265,SAM:,Great. That was very educational. Thank you. Dean.
265,SAM:,"All right. Hit up the graveyard, dig up Kate?"
265,DEAN:,All right. Wait a second.
265,SAM:,"All signs point to her, Dean."
265,DEAN:,No. Just hold on a damn minute.
265,DEAN:,"Enough with ""just the facts."""
265,SAM:,We agreed—
265,DEAN:,"No, we agreed to work the case. We didn't agree for you to be a dick the whole time."
265,SAM:,What?
265,DEAN:,"You're pissed, okay? And you've got a right."
265,SAM:,"Yeah, damn straight."
265,DEAN:,But enough's enough.
265,SAM:,"Says who? Look, I'll work this damn case, but you lied to me, and you killed my friend."
265,DEAN:,"No, I put down a monster who killed four people, and if you didn't know her, you'd have done the same thing."
265,DEAN:,"Yeah, which is why you couldn't do it."
265,DEAN:,"Look, I get it. There are certain people in this world, no matter how dangerous they are, you just can't."
265,SAM:,"Don't pull that card! That's bull. Look, if I've learned one thing, it's that if something feels wrong, it probably is!"
265,DEAN:,"Usually, yeah. But killing Amy was not wrong. You couldn't do it, so I did. That's what family does – the dirty work. And I woulda told you, eventually, once I knew that this whole ""waving a gun at Satan"" thing was a one-time show. I think it's reasonable to want to know that you're off the friggin' high dive, Sam. You almost got us both killed, so you can be pissed all you want, but quit being a bitch."
265,SAM:,I get why she's killing people. I don't get why she's warning them.
265,DEAN:,"Give them a taste of the curse, maybe? It couldn't have been a joyride."
265,SAM:,Here we go.
265,DEAN:,"Sam! Back off, crazy eyes."
265,GHOST:,Listen to me. Why isn't anybody listening?
265,GHOST:,No.
265,DEAN:,You don't get a vote.
265,GHOST:,No! Stop!
265,GHOST:,No!
265,DEAN:,Nice timing.
265,MELANIE:,They took care of it.
265,MELANIE:,I guess.
265,MELANIE:,"Hey, why don't you come stay with me a couple days?"
265,MELANIE:,"It's fine, hon."
265,MELANIE:,"Camille, it's okay. Let's just go."
265,MELANIE:,What is it?
265,CAMILLE:,Call them back! Now!
265,CAMILLE:,Mel!
265,MELANIE:,Camille! Camille!
265,MELANIE:,Camille! No!
265,DEAN:,"Should have known that whole ""good sis, bad sis"" story was just showmanship crap. Oh, and it turns out that Kate was just trying to warn people about her evil bitch sister. And we burned her bones, so that's gone."
265,SAM:,Dean.
265,DEAN:,What?
265,SAM:,All we can do now is go stop her.
265,DEAN:,"That's not good enough, by a mile."
265,SAM:,I know. Believe me. But – can we talk about this later?
265,DEAN:,Hey. How you holding up?
265,MELANIE:,Been better.
265,DEAN:,"Listen, if you need for us to leave—"
265,MELANIE:,I need you guys to leave.
265,SAM:,"Sam: Okay, we will. It's just that... Look – Margaret is still out there."
265,MELANIE:,What do you guys need to know?
265,SAM:,Is there anything that stood out?
265,MELANIE:,"Well, um... she barely gave a crap about me. I mean, I was just in the way. She was all about getting Camille."
265,DEAN:,Okay. That's something.
265,MELANIE:,One other thing. Um... she enjoyed it. She was smiling.
265,DEAN:,I feel naked doing this in daylight.
265,SAM:,Yeah. Let's just hurry up.
265,DEAN:,"All right, Mags. My lighter's juiced this time."
265,DEAN:,Geraldo'd.
265,SAM:,Not good.
265,DEAN:,Never good.
265,SAM:,"Dean, if someone knew enough to take Margaret's bones, they're not kidding around. That's serious binding magic."
265,DEAN:,Great.
265,DEAN:,Psychic ghost bitch on a leash.
265,SAM:,We got to find those bones.
265,DEAN:,So we got to find the bonehead.
265,SAM:,"So, what? We call Bobby, see what it take to harness the power of a ghost?"
265,DEAN:,Yeah.
265,DEAN:,"Hey, Sam, you know why I'm not going to spend my money at the annual Lily Dale E.S.P. Festival and hot-dog-eating contest this year?"
265,SAM:,Can't imagine.
265,DEAN:,Because all the headliners are dead.
265,MELANIE:,"You know, after Nikolai... They asked Camille to take his spot. I mean, she's so popular. Was so popular."
265,DEAN:,"Okay, uh, all these people – would you say that they're the, uh, you know, top dogs in town?"
265,MELANIE:,"Well, it's not really like that."
265,DEAN:,"But they were all doing well. I mean, your grandma?"
265,MELANIE:,"She wrote a few books. Yeah, and Imelda was on ""The Nate Berkus Show"" twice, so, yeah, I guess they were doing pretty well. You think that's why she went after them?"
265,DEAN:,"I mean, if you had to guess, who do you think would be next in line?"
265,MELANIE:,"I mean, I don't know."
265,DEAN:,"Well, your grandma was headlining at the big hall, so who do you think they would ask to fill in for her?"
265,MELANIE:,Probably... me.
265,SAM:,Hey.
265,JIMMY:,Agent. Are you here with my check?
265,SAM:,I'm looking for someone who bought some things from you.
265,JIMMY:,How do you know from me?
265,SAM:,I'm kind of doubting they sell ash-wood altars at the Gas 'n Sip.
265,JIMMY:,Valid. Let me see the list.
265,JIMMY:,Ah. Here we go. Credit-card receipt. I assume you want the address?
265,SAM:,That’d be great. Thanks.
265,JIMMY:,It's the least I can do. I just heard about Camille Thibodeaux.
265,SAM:,Thanks a lot.
265,JIMMY:,You're welcome.
265,MELANIE:,You sure that'll work?
265,DEAN:,That should hold her off long enough for Sam to find the bones and burn them. Hopefully.
265,MELANIE:,Hopefully? Does it hurt 'em? Burning their bones?
265,DEAN:,"I never really thought about it. Probably, yeah."
265,MELANIE:,Good.
265,SAM:,Where's the altar?
265,INSTRUCTOR:,It's there!
265,SAM:,You're... not a necromancer.
265,INSTRUCTOR:,"This is a Lamaze class, I swear."
265,SAM:,I-I believe you. Sorry.
265,INSTRUCTOR:,Omm...
265,JIMMY:,"Somehow, I just knew you'd be back."
265,JIMMY:,"Hi, Agent. Put the skull down."
265,SAM:,"Okay, okay. Take it easy. Here."
265,SAM:,All right. That's enough.
265,MELANIE:,Is she gone?
265,DEAN:,I doubt it.
265,MELANIE:,"But she can't get past the line, right?"
265,DEAN:,Right.
265,SAM:,Nice binding spell.
265,JIMMY:,It doesn't matter. She helps me because she wants to.
265,SAM:,What?
265,DEAN:,Oh. Damn it. I hate when they do that. Get the salt. Go.
265,MELANIE:,Dean!
265,JIMMY:,...are the same. We're the real thing.
265,JIMMY:,...pretty or entertaining enough.
265,JIMMY:,"When I show people what I'm capable of, it scares them. I can't pay my rent!"
265,DEAN:,Get behind me.
265,DEAN:,"That's as far as you go, bitch."
265,JIMMY:,Margaret's happy to kill for me. She likes the leash.
265,SAM:,You're sick.
265,JIMMY:,"You know what else I am? A real psychic, you dick-bag."
265,JIMMY:,Surprise.
265,SAM:,Where are the rest of the bones?
265,SAM:,These people don't deserve to die.
265,JIMMY:,"Oh, come on! Are you kidding me? I live in squalor 'cause I can't put on a show like them?"
265,SAM:,"Don't do this. They're in the bedroom, aren't they?"
265,JIMMY:,No.
265,JIMMY:,You're not getting in there.
265,MELANIE:,Dean!
265,SAM:,Yeah.
265,SAM:,Dean.
265,WAITER:,Can I get you anything else?
265,DEAN:,"Uh, just a refill. And if you affirmate me, I'm gonna punch you in the face."
265,WAITER:,"All righty then. Coffee, coming up."
265,DEAN:,I can't wait to get out of this frickin' fortune cookie.
265,SAM:,Dean.
265,SAM:,"I'm gonna go, um... do something outside."
265,DEAN:,Hi.
265,MELANIE:,Hi.
265,DEAN:,Have a seat.
265,MELANIE:,"Oh, thank you."
265,DEAN:,Yeah.
265,MELANIE:,You didn't stick around so I could say thank you.
265,DEAN:,No reason to thank me.
265,MELANIE:,You saved my life.
265,DEAN:,"Yeah, but not your friend's."
265,MELANIE:,"Well... you didn't send that ghost, so... thank you for coming to kill it. You and Sam seem a little better."
265,DEAN:,You could tell that from the walk up?
265,MELANIE:,"[smiling] Take it or leave it. Also guessing you're not so keen to come visit here again, so...this is goodbye. Wish we'd met on a better week."
265,DEAN:,I wish I had better weeks.
265,MELANIE:,Oh.
265,DEAN:,"But, uh, hey. You never know. It's not like you can tell the future, right?"
265,MELANIE:,Hmm.
265,MELANIE:,"Well, answer's hazy. Try again later."
265,DEAN:,Right.
265,DEAN:,Hey.
265,SAM:,Hey.
265,DEAN:,That's your stuff.
265,SAM:,Yeah. Yeah. I figured we'd take one car.
265,DEAN:,Works for me. You still want to break my face?
265,SAM:,"No. Uh, not at this moment. Look, you know what? Um... You were right. About Amy. If she was... just any monster, I'm not sure I could have let her walk away. I don't know. I mean, I'll never know."
265,DEAN:,"So, what are you saying?"
265,SAM:,"What I'm saying is... I get why you did it. You were just trying to make sure no one else got hurt. But here's the thing. You can't just look me in the face and tell me you're fine. I mean, you're not sleeping, you drink for the record—"
265,DEAN:,"Oh, here we go."
265,SAM:,"Look, whatever. Last one to preach, I know. But... Just be honest with me. How are those the actions of someone who knows they did the right thing?"
265,DEAN:,You want me to be honest?
265,SAM:,Yeah.
265,DEAN:,"I went with my gut. And that felt right. I didn't trust her, Sam. Of course, ever since Cas, I'm having a hard time trusting anybody. And as far as how I been acting... I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause I don't like lying to you. You know, it doesn't feel right. So, yeah, you got me there. I been climbing the walls."
265,SAM:,"I know how that is. But, hey... If I learned one thing from that museum, sibling acts are tough."
265,DEAN:,"Oh, don't compare us to that hall of crazy."
265,DEAN:,We're like poster kids of functional family life compared to them.
265,SAM:,It's a low bar.
265,DEAN:,"Well, hey... grading on a curve has got me past everything since kindergarten, so don't knock it."
265,SAM:,Whatever you say.
265,SAM:,I still want to know how that guy bent my spoon.
265,DEAN:,"Forget it, Sam. It's Lily Dale."
266,WAITRESS:,"Okay, you won't believe it. People think I just say it to get a bigger tip."
266,DEAN:,Try me.
266,WAITRESS:,Fine. I'm in grad school. See? Okay? There's a look. [laughs] Okay? Stop.
266,DEAN:,"No, this is my ""I dig smart chicks"" look. Now, if they, uh, if they wore that, I... I wouldn't have dropped out of school."
266,WAITRESS:,"So, what's your deal?"
266,DEAN:,My deal?
266,WAITRESS:,"Yeah, okay. You came in here looking like somebody shot your puppy."
266,DEAN:,"Well, things are looking up now that your shift's over. All right. Uh, here's the deal. I have this friend. He's got this younger brother. Right? Cannon's a little loose. You know, his reactor blew a while back. It's not good. Um... My friend – he's, uh... He's kind of been sitting, waiting to see if he goes guano again."
266,WAITRESS:,And I assume it just hit the fan?
266,DEAN:,"Well, that's the thing. It didn't. The kid's all reasonable now, considering he's crazy. Well, he's – I mean, he's not crazy. He – he's starting to seem like things might be getting a little better."
266,WAITRESS:,"Well, that's a good thing, right?"
266,DEAN:,"It's a freakin' miracle. Except... when it happens during their, uh... their sacred annual pilgrimage to Vegas... and he goes off on some granola-munching hike in the desert by himself."
266,WAITRESS:,"Well, maybe he just needs some time alone."
266,DEAN:,Yeah.
266,WAITRESS:,We all need to face ourselves sometime.
266,DEAN:,Maybe he does.
266,WAITRESS:,Wasn't talking about him.
266,DEAN:,Excuse me.
266,DEAN:,Speak of the devil. He's four blocks away?
266,WAITRESS:,See? Baby bro needs you after all.
266,SAM:,Dean. It's okay. You won't need that. Come on.
266,DEAN:,"I thought you were out, uh, becoming one with the land or some crap."
266,SAM:,You got to – come here.
266,SAM:,All right. Now...
266,DEAN:,What is this?
266,SAM:,"Uh, apparently, uh, pink is for loyalty."
266,DEAN:,"All right, so, what's the pretext? What are we – uh, wedding crashers, huh? We lookin' for some kind of siren or what?"
266,SAM:,"No. Nothing like that. All right, um... So, a little sudden. But life is short, so I'll keep this shorter."
266,SAM:,I'm in love. And I'm getting married.
266,SAM:,"Say something, like, uh, like, ""congratulations,"" for example."
266,DEAN:,What?
266,DEAN:,What the hell?
266,DEAN:,Becky?
266,BECKY:,Dean. I'm so glad you're here.
266,DEAN:,Shouldn't she ask for my permission or something?
266,SAM:,Y-you want her to ask for my hand?
266,DEAN:,How in the – How did this happen?
266,SAM:,"Short version? We – we – we met. We ate and – and talked and fell in love. And, you know, here we are."
266,DEAN:,"Yeah, I-I guess I'm all caught up. That's – okay. You know what? Ignoring everything, have you forgotten the average life-span of your hookups?"
266,SAM:,"Yeah, but—"
266,BECKY:,"But if anyone knows that, it's me. I mean, I read every book. So, open eyes, you know? Open eyes."
266,DEAN:,I'm gonna be sick.
266,SAM:,"Dean, look, it's simple. If- if something good's happening, I-I got to jump on it – now, today, uh, period."
266,DEAN:,"Okay, ""Dead Poets Society."" Fine. [to BECKY] No offense. [to SAM] Did you make sure she's even really—"
266,BECKY:,"Salt, holy water, everything. See?"
266,BECKY:,Not a monster. Just the right girl for your brother.
266,DEAN:,Ah.
266,BECKY:,That's it.
266,MAN:,The bill.
266,BECKY:,I got it. You two do your brother thing.
266,DEAN:,Really?! Superfan ninety-nine?!
266,SAM:,"Dean, look. Honest to God, I-I had the exact same opinion of her as you do. But when we got past the whole book thing, I found out t-that she's great and I was the dick."
266,DEAN:,"Yeah, you know, speaking of the whole, uh, book thing... Becky randomly shows up during Vegas week?"
266,SAM:,Yeah.
266,DEAN:,Yeah.
266,SAM:,"Okay, um, what are you trying to say?"
266,DEAN:,"I'm saying maybe she knew you were gonna be here. Maybe, uh, uh, uh, Chuck wrote about it."
266,SAM:,"Dean, you're paranoid."
266,DEAN:,"And you're in love?! It's been four days, man!"
266,SAM:,"You know what, Dean? You know what? Um, how about this? Becky and I are gonna go up to her place in Delaware. Um, why don't you try and wrap your dome around this, get a little supportive, then give us a call?"
266,BECKY:,"""First official Tweet as Mrs. Becky Rosen-Winchester!"""
266,SAM:,I thought we just ate.
266,BECKY:,Quick stop.
266,BECKY:,"Hi, Jocelyn."
266,JOCELYN:,Yes. Can I help you?
266,BECKY:,It's Becky. Becky Rosen.
266,JOCELYN:,"Ohh! ""Yechie Becky."""
266,BECKY:,Ha. Long time ago.
266,JOCELYN:,"Yechie Becky! Oh! Well, you look just the same, don't you?"
266,BECKY:,"I'm here to RSVP for the reunion, if it's not too late."
266,JOCELYN:,"No, no, there is always room for one more."
266,BECKY:,Actually...
266,BECKY:,"It's Rosen-Winchester. So mark me down ""plus one."""
266,BECKY:,"""Jocelyn Caruso roasted."""
266,BECKY:,"Hi, Guy!"
266,GUY:,You're back! How was Vegas?
266,BECKY:,It was awesome!
266,GUY:,Really? Really?
266,BECKY:,"Guy, meet my husband, Sam."
266,GUY:,"Hey. It's an honor to meet you, Sam."
266,SAM:,Thanks. You too.
266,BECKY:,Guy's a really good friend. We met in the erotic horror section at the novel hovel.
266,GUY:,"Oh, my God, Becky. Come on! TMI! Poor guy's just met me."
266,SAM:,"No, it's okay. Nice to meet you. Look, any friend of Becky's..."
266,GUY:,"Anyway, I should, uh, get back to it, or this party's not gonna happen, right?"
266,SAM:,Sure.
266,BECKY:,Guy's an event planner. Reunion season is very busy for him. Hold on one sec?
266,BECKY:,One more thing. You get my message?
266,GUY:,Of course. I thought you'd never ask. Give me a hug.
266,BECKY:,"I swear, if everyone had a Wiccan in their pocket, the world would be a happier place."
266,GUY:,"It is nothing. Blessed be, sweetie."
266,SAM:,Wow. Y-you look n-nice.
266,BECKY:,"Thanks! I was, you know... saving it."
266,BECKY:,To us.
266,SAM:,To us.
266,SAM:,Umm!
266,BECKY:,"Sam? Are you okay? Sammy, honey, what's wrong?"
266,SAM:,Becky? W-why am I... What am I doing here?
266,BECKY:,"We're celebrating, dear. Remember?"
266,SAM:,"Uh... yeah, yeah, of course. To us."
266,BECKY:,"Feeling better, honey?"
266,SAM:,Now that I'm with you.
266,DEAN:,Me being supportive. Congratulations to you and the missus.
266,SAM:,Thanks.
266,DEAN:,"It's a waffle iron. Nonstick. Yeah, you just, uh..."
266,DEAN:,I actually don't know how to use it. Are we good?
266,BECKY:,"Our first thought was crossroads demons, but there's that 10-year time frame on collecting souls."
266,BECKY:,"Then there's cursed object, like in ""Bad Day at Black Rock,"" but we haven't been able to connect the vics yet."
266,DEAN:,You're working this case... together?
266,SAM:,"Yeah. I know. Right? I mean, I guess all those Chuck Shurley books paid off."
266,DEAN:,"All right, listen, Cookie, I don't know what kind of mojo you're working, but, believe me, I will find out."
266,SAM:,"Dean, that's...my wife you're talking to."
266,DEAN:,"You're not even acting like yourself, Sam!"
266,SAM:,How am I not?
266,DEAN:,You married Becky Rosen!
266,BECKY:,What are you saying? I'm a witch? Or maybe I'm a siren. Ever occur to you we're just – I don't know – happy?
266,DEAN:,"Come on, Sam! Guy wins the lotto, guy hits the bigs. All right, obviously, uh, people's dreams are coming true in this town. Don't you think this is a little bit of a coincidence?"
266,SAM:,"You know what, Dean? What Becky and I have is real. And if you can't accept that, that's your problem, not ours."
266,DEAN:,"Or maybe she's part of it. Because for whatever reason, you're her dream. If you really do care about her, I'd be worried. Because people who do get their little fantasies or whatever seem to end up dead pretty quick."
266,SAM:,"You know, I went after her, Dean. Maybe that's what's bugging you – that I'm moving on with my life. I mean, you took care of me, and that's great. But I don't need you anymore."
266,SAM:,Hey. Uh...
266,SAM:,I got you a present.
266,BECKY:,His and hers fake IDs? Oh!
266,SAM:,Here. Check this out.
266,BECKY:,Junior salesman leapfrogs to CEO at Mutual Freedom Insurance. You think the CEO is a lead?
266,SAM:,"Uh, Becky?"
266,SAM:,This is...beautiful.
266,SAM:,"So, what do you think about the CEO?"
266,BECKY:,Let's go pretext him!
266,GARTH:,Hey. You Dean?
266,GARTH:,Hmm. I thought you'd be taller.
266,DEAN:,I assume Bobby filled you in on the road.
266,GARTH:,"He told me two things. One, he's tangling with a major-league nest up in Oregon territory. Numero dos, he said you'd be all, uh, surly and premenstrual working with me. But, hey, man, sticks and stones."
266,DEAN:,Think I found a case. Check the headline.
266,GARTH:,First things first.
266,GARTH:,"Oh, Marmaduke, you're crazy!"
266,MARSHA:,"Are you trying to humiliate me? It's Marsha with an ""s-h-a,"" not a ""c-i-a."""
266,GARTH:,"Hey, is that your—"
266,DEAN:,Yes.
266,GARTH:,Awkward.
266,DEAN:,Hi.
266,DEAN:,Okay. So...
266,SAM:,"So, uh, no point in going in. Guy's clean."
266,DEAN:,You sure?
266,SAM:,Yeah. Positive. Becky grilled him like a pro. She's a real natural.
266,DEAN:,Huh.
266,SAM:,What's with the scrawny guy?
266,DEAN:,Temp.
266,CEO:,"Throw a rock, hit a reporter these days, eh?"
266,CEO:,Go ahead. Shoot.
266,DEAN:,All right. Uh... how'd you get the gig?
266,CEO:,"Board came to me, asked. Said yes."
266,DEAN:,Just out of the blue?
266,CEO:,Pretty much.
266,DEAN:,"Huh. And, uh, any idea how the board landed on you over your supervisors?"
266,CEO:,"Um, they didn't say."
266,DEAN:,Could you tell us what specifically excited the board about your actual qualifications?
266,CEO:,"Say, fellas, what's with the third degree?"
266,GARTH:,"Oh, uh, no offense. We were just wondering if you got here by nefarious means."
266,DEAN:,Whoa! Garth!
266,GARTH:,"Oh. Uh, I-I didn't mean, of course, uh, corporate backstabbing – I'm sorry. I meant more like, uh, you know, black magic or hoodoo."
266,DEAN:,"Ha ha ha ha! Oh! He jokes. He's a– he's a jokester. Let's, uh, rewind. Why don't, uh, why don't you tell us what it felt like when your big dream came true?"
266,CEO:,"Look, on the record, it's great."
266,DEAN:,Off the record?
266,CEO:,It's not my big dream.
266,GARTH:,Wait. You didn't want this job?
266,CEO:,"Hell, no. I'm a sales guy. I was good in sales."
266,MARSHA:,Your secretary's an idiot. I'll be at the printers this afternoon.
266,CEO:,"All right, dear. See you at dinner."
266,MARSHA:,"Just have the idiot make a reservation. Here's a tip – remind her she works for the CEO. One more screw-up, she's fired."
266,GARTH:,"Your, uh, wife seems pretty stoked on the promotion, don't she?"
266,CEO:,"Honestly, I've never seen her happier. I have no idea how I'm gonna tell her I have to resign. The news is just gonna—"
266,GARTH:,Kill her?
266,DEAN:,Mrs. Burrows? Hi.
266,MARSHA:,Can I help you?
266,DEAN:,"Yes, we're, uh, we're doing a story on your husband's promotion. Wanted to ask you a few questions."
266,MARSHA:,I'm sorry. I can't today. If you schedule it with his girl...
266,DEAN:,"Okay, you know what? I'm trying to save you from a really bad accident."
266,MARSHA:,Are you threatening me?
266,DEAN:,No.
266,DEAN:,"No, I-I-I'm pointing out a pattern. Why do people keep thinking I'm threatening them?"
266,GARTH:,"Because it sounded exactly like a threat, dude."
266,DEAN:,"Look, for your own good, what did you do to get him promoted?"
266,MARSHA:,I have no idea what you're talking about. Now leave me alone. Or do I have to call security?
266,SAM:,"No, no, no, something's not adding up."
266,BECKY:,I'm sure we'll get a break.
266,BECKY:,"""As soon as we're done working, romantic honeymoon getaway."""
266,DEAN:,You okay?
266,MARSHA:,How did you know?
266,DEAN:,'Cause you're not the first. Come on.
266,GARTH:,You want to tell us what's up here?
266,MARSHA:,"I was having lunch with friends. This guy heard me bitching. Next thing I know, he's making me an offer."
266,DEAN:,An offer?
266,MARSHA:,"Craig's job for my soul. I know. Hilarious. I mean, what have I got to lose?"
266,GARTH:,"Well, there's your soul. What kind of demon deal is this? Timeline's whack."
266,MARSHA:,What are you talking about? Demon?
266,GARTH:,Let me back up here. You made a deal with a demon in exchange for your everlasting. Except those are 10-year contracts. Why's the bill coming due so fast?
266,DEAN:,"I don't know, but I got a bad feeling about who's next. We got to find Sam, pronto."
266,GARTH:,"All right, all right, all right. Uh, here's the plan. I drop this lady at my cousin's. He'll stop anything trying to get her. We, uh, find Sam, hopefully fix this, everybody's home in time for ""America's Got Talent."" Now, you – you'll be living with a tri-racial paraplegic sniper until this all blows over, okay?"
266,SAM:,Becky... W-what's – what's happening?
266,BECKY:,Don't you remember? We're married.
266,SAM:,"Oh, g– I'm calling Dean."
266,BECKY:,"Sam, do you feel concussion-y? How many fingers am I holding up?"
266,SAM:,Where am I? What the hell's going on?
266,BECKY:,Sam... Just calm down.
266,SAM:,"Calm down?! You hogtied me t– Becky, why – why am I not wearing any pants?"
266,BECKY:,They're very constricting.
266,BECKY:,Don't worry. I didn't do anything weird. I was helping.
266,SAM:,Let me go. Now!
266,BECKY:,"Are you thirsty? Or do you need a bottle... to, you know, tinkle? It's okay if you do. I can help."
266,BECKY:,Finally!
266,SAM:,"Wait. What? Wait. Becky? Becky. Hey, hey, don't! Don't! Becky!"
266,BECKY:,Where have you been?
266,BECKY:,"Big problem. I'm at my parents' cabin. I've got Sam tied to a bed. I'm out of elixir. I need a refill, okay? This isn't the honeymoon I had in mind. Well, some of it is, but not in this context. And is it just me, or is this stuff wearing off faster and faster?"
266,BECKY:,"Do you know we haven't even consummated our marriage? We were taking it slow 'cause true love is forever, but everything just feels weird now."
266,SAM:,So you dosed me with a love potion.
266,BECKY:,How—
266,SAM:,Thin walls.
266,BECKY:,"Look... Yes, I used a social lubricant to—"
266,SAM:,You roofied me!
266,BECKY:,A roofie? I'd never. We had a great time together. You were happy.
266,SAM:,"Oh, yeah."
266,SAM:,I'm thrilled.
266,BECKY:,I have to go.
266,SAM:,"You know your pal Guy is the one icing all those people, right?"
266,BECKY:,"No, he's not."
266,SAM:,"Oh, so he's not a witch?"
266,BECKY:,"No. He's just a Wiccan. Wiccans are good, like Glinda of Oz."
266,SAM:,"You're not this stupid, Becky."
266,BECKY:,Whatever is killing people... it's something else.
266,SAM:,"It's never something else. When are there ever two crazy things in town at the same time? Guy's the creep, and you're on his list."
266,BECKY:,No. He's my friend.
266,SAM:,"No, he's your dealer. Look, I don't know how much he's charging you for that Spanish Fly—"
266,BECKY:,"Nothing! He gives it to me. And he said it wouldn't even work unless you already loved me, deep down. It just activates it."
266,SAM:,So you think I love you?
266,SAM:,Then untie me.
266,SAM:,[muffled] No. No!
266,BECKY:,You're still working through your emotions.
266,SAM:,[muffled] Becky!
266,BECKY:,"I love you, too!"
266,GUY:,"[to waiter] On the table, next to the nametags."
266,BECKY:,Guy.
266,GUY:,Why don't you take a seat?
266,GUY:,Tough day? Okay. We can cut right to it if you like.
266,GUY:,Ah. Let's talk price.
266,BECKY:,What?
266,GUY:,"Well, we're a little past the freebie stage, don't you think?"
266,BECKY:,But I thought we were besties.
266,GUY:,"Ohh, honey. That is so depressingly ""Becky."" I mean, it's – you're so pathetic, it actually loops back around again to cute."
266,BECKY:,"Okay. You want me to pay, fine. Do you accept personal checks?"
266,GUY:,No. But I will take your soul.
266,BECKY:,You're a crossroads demon.
266,GUY:,"Bingo, bango! I love reunions. The desperation! These schlubs will sign on the dotted line for money, power, hair – whatever it takes to impress the nostalgically bangable head cheerleader."
266,BECKY:,Sam was right. You killed those people.
266,GUY:,"But for legal reasons, let's just say they had... unfortunate accidents."
266,BECKY:,"So, what, I hand over my soul, and the next day a piano falls on my head?"
266,GUY:,"No, I'd never do that to you. I promise."
266,BECKY:,I'm not stupid.
266,GUY:,But you are special.
266,BECKY:,I am?
266,GUY:,"Hey. I wasn't thrilled to see your new hubby was Sam freakin' Winchester. I mean, if he knew that I was here talking to you, I mean, he'd probably—"
266,BECKY:,Gank your ass.
266,GUY:,"Yes! And I'm very protective of my ass. It's one of my best features. Becky, I'm prepared to offer you a one-time-only deal. Not ten years. Twenty-five. No pianos, guaranteed. Just Sam."
266,BECKY:,For my soul.
266,GUY:,"And your promise to not breathe a word about this to the Winchesters, and I'll be on my merry way. No one gets a deal like this, Becky. Not kings, not popes. I snap my fingers, and Sam will love you for the rest of your life."
266,BECKY:,I think I'll have that drink now.
266,DEAN:,Anything?
266,GARTH:,"Uh, she's got 11 Twitter...ers. Last post – ""Going on romantic trip with hubster!!!"" Three exclamation points. I guess she got excited."
266,DEAN:,That look romantic to you?
266,GARTH:,"Oh, hell, no. But I got this thing about fish. Dead eyes, man."
266,DEAN:,Huh.
266,BECKY:,Well... this is not how I imagined spending my reunion.
266,BECKY:,"I was gonna show you off – not that anyone actually knows who you are. ""Supernatural"" is not exactly popular, but... you're tall... and nice and... they'd all think I was happy."
266,BECKY:,You're mad. I get it. But...
266,BECKY:,Can we talk?
266,SAM:,"[muffled] Oh, God."
266,BECKY:,I know you don't love me.
266,SAM:,"[muffled] Yeah, you got that right."
266,SAM:,What?
266,BECKY:,"I mean, not that you're a loser, but you had that whole character arc about being a freak, and... I can relate."
266,SAM:,"[muffled] Oh, my God."
266,BECKY:,"Honestly... The only place people understood me was the message boards. They were grumpy and overly literal, but at least we shared a common passion. And I'll take it, you know? Then I met you guys – the real Sam and Dean. And I started dating Chuck."
266,BECKY:,"And everything was... amazing. But you left, and Chuck dumped me. I think I intimidated him with my vibrant sexuality."
266,BECKY:,I just want someone who loves me for me! Is that too much to ask?
266,BECKY:,What?
266,SAM:,"If you want somebody to love you for you, maybe don't drug them."
266,BECKY:,But I want you! And this is the only way!
266,SAM:,"Becky. Becky, you're better than this."
266,BECKY:,"That's sweet, but... I'm not so sure."
266,GUY:,Becks! You missed the party.
266,BECKY:,Yeah. Well... weird night.
266,GUY:,"So, what are we thinking?"
266,BECKY:,Okay. I'm in.
266,GUY:,You're making the right choice.
266,BECKY:,I know. So... we seal the deal with a kiss?
266,GUY:,"Exactly. Pucker up, sweetheart."
266,BECKY:,I'm not your sweetheart!
266,GARTH:,Blueberry vodka. The answer to all of life's problems.
266,BECKY:,"You see that, Sam? I did it just like we said! I am awesome! I – I'll be over here."
266,GUY:,"Dean Winchester. This is really thrilling. Hey, can I have your autograph?"
266,DEAN:,"Sure. Yeah, I'll, uh, carve it into your spleen. So, how you running your little scam?"
266,GUY:,"Well, how do you mean, Dean?"
266,SAM:,"Signing 10-year deals, snuffing 'em that week."
266,GUY:,"Well, I would never. No. Rules of the road – can't lay a hair on any of my clients."
266,DEAN:,Right. So how you cheating it?
266,GUY:,"I'm not a cheater. I'm an innovator. It's called a loophole, you moron. Yes, when a person bargains away his soul, he gets a decade, technically. But accidents happen."
266,SAM:,"So you're arranging ""accidents"" and collecting early?"
266,GUY:,"Oh, please. White gloves. I don't get my hands dirty. That's why it's important to have a capable intern."
266,GUY:,What time did I ask you to be here? What time did I ask you to be here?!
266,DEAN:,"Exorcizamus te, omnis—"
266,SAM:,Becky...run!
266,BECKY:,Whoa.
266,DEAN:,"How many deals you got cooking in this town, Madoff?"
266,GUY:,Fifteen.
266,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, call them off, or I'll cut my own loophole in your throat."
266,GUY:,"Oh, crap."
266,DEAN:,"Yeah, you said it. You're in a world—"
266,CROWLEY:,"Hello, boys."
266,DEAN:,"Oh, crap."
266,CROWLEY:,"Sam, mazel tov. Who's the lucky lady?"
266,BECKY:,You're Crowley!
266,CROWLEY:,"And you're – well, I'm sure you have a wonderful personality, dear."
266,DEAN:,"Ah, another step, and I'll Colombian necktie your little friend here."
266,CROWLEY:,"Please, don't let him get off that easy."
266,GUY:,"Sir, I don't think that you—"
266,CROWLEY:,"I know exactly what you've been doing. A little birdie named Jackson [GUY glances at GUY'S INTERN, dead on the floor] sold you out, e-mailed all the juicy deets to my suggestion box."
266,CROWLEY:,"I assume... That's my whistle-blower? Shame. Had a future. Unfortunately, you don't."
266,GUY:,I was just—
266,CROWLEY:,"There's only one rule – make a deal, keep it."
266,GUY:,"Well, technically, I didn't—"
266,CROWLEY:,"There's a reason we don't call our chits in early – consumer confidence. This isn't Wall Street! This is Hell! We have a little something called integrity. This gets out, who'll deal with us? Nobody! Then where are we?"
266,GUY:,I don't know.
266,CROWLEY:,"That's right. You don't. Because you're a stupid, shortsighted little prat. Now, hand the jackass over. I'll cancel every deal he's made."
266,DEAN:,What are you gonna do with him?
266,CROWLEY:,"Make an example of him. Fair trade, right? We all go our separate ways. No harm done."
266,SAM:,"What, out of the goodness of your heart?"
266,CROWLEY:,"Years of demons nipping at your heels, haven't seen one for months. Wonder why?"
266,DEAN:,We've been a little busy.
266,CROWLEY:,"Hunting Leviathan – yes, I know. That's why I told my lads to stay clear of you meatheads."
266,SAM:,"So, what do you know about—"
266,CROWLEY:,"Too much. You met that dick yet? Smuggest tub of goo since Mussolini. I hate the bastards. Squash 'em all, please. I'll stay clear."
266,DEAN:,Rip up the contracts first.
266,CROWLEY:,Done... and done. Your turn.
266,GUY:,"No, no, no, no. Let—"
266,CROWLEY:,"Pleasure, gentlemen."
266,GARTH:,What'd I miss?
266,BECKY:,"It... it wasn't all bad, right?"
266,SAM:,"Okay, y-you did save my life, and for that, thanks."
266,BECKY:,"So, I'll see you again?"
266,SAM:,"Yeah, probably not."
266,SAM:,"Becky, look. You're not a loser, okay? You're a good person, a-and you've got... a lot of... e-energy. So, you know, just do your thing, whatever that is, and the right guy will find you."
266,DEAN:,"Well, buddy, I got to say, man – you, uh... you don't suck."
266,GARTH:,Thank you. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. Well...
266,DEAN:,"Oh. Yeah. All right, that's – thank you."
266,DEAN:,Take care. (to SAM) Wow.
266,SAM:,"Aww, you made a fwiend."
266,DEAN:,Uh-uh.
266,SAM:,"Look, man, uh... When I was all dosed up, I-I said some crap."
266,DEAN:,"Oh, you mean, she – she wasn't your soulmate?"
266,SAM:,"Shut up. I mean, I do need you watching my back. Obviously."
266,DEAN:,"Yeah, when, uh, crazy groupies attack."
266,SAM:,You know what I mean.
266,DEAN:,"You know, I got to say, man... For a whack-job, you really pulled it together."
266,SAM:,"That's the nicest thing anyone's said to me. Look, don't be too impressed, man. It's still a Denver scramble up here. I just know my way around the plate now."
266,DEAN:,I'm just saying. It's stupid to think that you need me around all the time. You're a grown-up.
266,SAM:,Right.
266,DEAN:,"You're a hike-in-the-desert, hippie-douche grown-up."
266,SAM:,"Dude, I was camping. You camp."
266,DEAN:,"Yeah, whatever. Hippie."
266,SAM:,"You know what, though? Seriously? It might be nice."
266,DEAN:,What?
266,SAM:,"I mean, you basically have been looking out for me your whole life. Now you finally get to take care of yourself. About time, huh?"
266,DEAN:,Yeah.
266,DEAN:,Right.
267,MAN:,"Good night, sweetie."
267,MAN:,What the hell? Leanne!
267,MAN:,No. No. Stay away. Leanne!
267,SAM:,Did you strip enough wire?
267,DEAN:,"Yes, I stripped enough wire."
267,SAM:,All right.
267,DEAN:,See? Told you.
267,BOBBY:,"Well, isn't this cozy?"
267,SAM:,"Yeah. Well, Motel 6 just ain't leaving the light on anymore."
267,BOBBY:,"Well, I'm taking a page out of Frank Devereaux's Bible on this. Everybody's out to get you -- paranoia is just plain common sense."
267,DEAN:,"Weeks, guys. Weeks. We've been living with cold showers, cold Hot Pockets, cold freaking everything. I mean, this is the bottom that we're living in. You guys get that, right?"
267,BOBBY:,"How many big mouths are out there, running card traces, like Chet, or hunting us down God knows what ways? No, now's not the time to be laying our bed rolls out on the grid. Not if we can help it."
267,DEAN:,"That's just great. This is stupid. Our quality of life is crap. We got Purgatory's least wanted everywhere, and we're on our third ""The World's Screwed"" issue in, what, three years? We've steered the bus away from the cliff twice already."
267,SAM:,Someone's got to do it.
267,DEAN:,What if the bus wants to go over the cliff?
267,SAM:,You think the world wants to end?
267,DEAN:,"I think that if we didn't take its belt and all its pens away each year that, yeah, the whole enchilada woulda offed itself already."
267,BOBBY:,"Stop trying to wrestle with the big picture, son. You're gonna hurt your head."
267,BOBBY:,"So, what's the guff?"
267,SAM:,"Well, uh, there’ve been a rash of sightings all over the southern pine barrens -- a strange, fast-moving, human-like creature. Locals even have a name for it."
267,BOBBY:,The Jersey Devil? I thought that was just local tall-tale crap.
267,SAM:,"The area's history of sightings goes back more than two centuries. Some accounts gave it bat wings, others horns, a...a tail."
267,SAM:,"And, uh, oh yeah, a horse's head."
267,DEAN:,"Of course, the sketch looks more like a Chewbacca head."
267,BOBBY:,Sounds kind of mixed up.
267,DEAN:,"Yeah, kind of like it should be fighting a Japanese robot."
267,SAM:,"Well, mixed up or not, it sounds like it might just have a body count."
267,BOBBY:,"""Camping high season harshed by human burrito""?"
267,SAM:,"Yeah. Something hung a camper up in a tree, then ate him alive right through his sleeping bag. His wife hasn't been seen, either. Plus, there have been four other missing persons reported in the last three weeks. State troopers -- get this -- are saying it's a rogue bear."
267,DEAN:,"Yeah, of course, when was the last time you saw a bear string up its own piñata?"
267,BOBBY:,"Something's out there in the woods. Hey, we're going honest to goodness wilderness hunting. I haven't used my .30-30 in a while."
267,DEAN:,"Okay, Davey Crockett, well, safari's gonna have to wait till tomorrow and after our suit-and-tie dance. We'll make sure this is not just some backwoods crackhead who likes to roll glampers."
267,BOBBY:,What the hell's a glamper?
267,DEAN:,Sam?
267,SAM:,"High-end camper. TV, A.C., Wi-Fi. Back to nature, zero inconvenience."
267,BOBBY:,That's idiotic.
267,SAM:,Yeah. Some people just don't know how to live.
267,DEAN:,"So, Ranger Evans –"
267,RANGER:,"Oh, uh, you can call me Rick. Ranger Rick."
267,DEAN:,"Uh, you were the one who found Mitchell Rayburn, correct?"
267,SAM:,State police have it down as a bear attack.
267,DEAN:,"Apparently, some others reported seeing something a little, you know, weirder."
267,DEAN:,So you're thinking it's Mother Nature?
267,SAM:,Who's Phil?
267,SAM:,But you think maybe your assistant chief ranger might be missing?
267,DEAN:,"Oh. Excuse us. Well, you, uh... enjoy your lunch... Ranger Rick."
267,DEAN:,So?
267,BOBBY:,"Well, I took a look at the cadaver -- what's left of it. Not a happy camper. Don't have any stats on a Jersey Devil, but the bite radius on the vic's wounds -- it's too small for a Leviathan. And he's still got a ventricle and some change, so I doubt we're talking werewolf. And a wendigo don't leave no scraps."
267,DEAN:,Hmm. Lunch?
267,BOBBY:,Starving.
267,DEAN:,"Hey! Uh, Brandon. We grab a booth?"
267,BRANDON:,"Hey, uh, douchewad, a hostess will seat you. Do I look like a freaking hostess?"
267,DEAN:,Do you want to look like a hostess?
267,SAM:,"That didn't really make sense, what you... said."
267,DEAN:,What was that?
267,BOBBY:,I sure hope we don't get Brandon's section.
267,BRANDON:,Sidewinder soup and salad combo goes to Big Bird.
267,BRANDON:,TDK slammer to Ken Doll.
267,BRANDON:,And a little heart-smart for creepy uncle.
267,DEAN:,What is your problem?
267,BRANDON:,You are my problem!
267,BOBBY:,"Oh, Brandon's got his flare all up in a bunch."
267,DEAN:,"Anyway, chief ranger -- I don't think he believes in the Jersey Devil."
267,SAM:,"Oh, oh, by the way, did he seem a little, uh, stoned to you?"
267,DEAN:,Ranger Rick? Yeah. Definitely growing his own on the back 40 and smoking all the profits.
267,SAM:,He did seem to think that there was something --
267,DEAN:,"[talking with mouth full] Oh, that is good sandwich."
267,BOBBY:,What the hell did you get?
267,DEAN:,New Pepperjack Turducken Slammer -- limited time only.
267,BOBBY:,Bunch of birds shoved up inside each other. Shouldn't play God like that.
267,DEAN:,"Hey, don't look at me sideways from that -- that Chinese chicken geezer salad there, okay? This is awesome. Like the perfect storm of your top-three edible birds."
267,SAM:,"All right, anyways, um... The ranger did seem to think there was something out in Wharton Forest."
267,BOBBY:,"Well, then I'd say it's safari time."
267,MAN:,She’s big-boned!
267,BRANDON:,Look at her! You're telling me she's not fat?
267,WAITER:,Hey.
267,BRANDON:,"Up yours, Mike. Shove it right up yours!"
267,DEAN:,"Well, anyway, back to bigger and better things."
267,BOBBY:,Couple of bucks. Head-butting over turf probably. Pretty sure the other fella won.
267,SAM:,"I guess I forgot. Before you were a hunter, you were actually a...hunter."
267,BOBBY:,"Yeah, well, we shot our dinner when I was a kid."
267,DEAN:,"You used to take us hunting. Remember? Dad had a case, he'd just dump us on you. Shoot, you must have taught us most of the outdoor tracking we know."
267,BOBBY:,"Yeah, what I could get to stick. I never could get you little grubs to pull a trigger on a single deer."
267,DEAN:,"You’re talking about Bambi, man."
267,BOBBY:,"You don't shoot Bambi, jackass. You shoot Bambi's mother."
267,DEAN:,"Well, looks like we found Phil."
267,DEAN:,That's what I said.
267,SAM:,"Yeah, yeah. Solid move, Rick."
267,BOBBY:,"Ranger, I think we've got company."
267,SAM:,Ranger!
267,SAM:,Ranger Evans! Ranger!
267,BOBBY:,It's got him up in the trees. Lights off.
267,DEAN:,What?
267,SAM:,"Wait, Bobby, you think that's really a good idea?"
267,BOBBY:,"Shut up, shut off, and listen."
267,BOBBY:,Damn thing’s eating Rick.
267,DEAN:,"Man, I liked Rick."
267,DEAN:,"Wow. Nice shot, Bobby."
267,SAM:,Seriously.
267,BOBBY:,We all got our gifts.
267,DEAN:,What about the rest of Ranger Rick?
267,BOBBY:,Ranger called in his 10-20. His own will find him. We got crap to do.
267,BOBBY:,"Built like a supermodel, but the thing was strong. That's for damn sure. Carried a full-grown man up a tree in nothing flat."
267,SAM:,"But, it only took one bullet to bring it down."
267,DEAN:,"And not even a silver bullet, just a bullet-bullet."
267,BOBBY:,First one must have just stunned it.
267,DEAN:,"All right, well, let's check its hulk pants for some ID."
267,DEAN:,"Oh, that is just gonna ruin the leather."
267,BOBBY:,Are you feeling okay?
267,DEAN:,"Yeah, I feel great."
267,SAM:,"Gerald Browder, uh, lived here in town, 5'9"", brown hair and blue eyes... 235 pounds."
267,DEAN:,Whoa.
267,BOBBY:,"Well, apparently, he's lost a little pudge."
267,DEAN:,Maybe it's a-a lap-band side effect.
267,BOBBY:,What the hell? I think we better have a look under Gerald's hood.
267,BOBBY:,God! Its organs are swimming in the stuff.
267,DEAN:,You guys getting hungry? I'm hungry.
267,SAM:,What's that?
267,BOBBY:,"His stomach. For a guy on a diet, Gerry here packed it in pretty good."
267,SAM:,That's human right there.
267,BOBBY:,That's fresh Rick. Let's see. Plus... a pine cone? Pack of gum in the wrapper.
267,SAM:,That's -- that's older. Maybe like a -- maybe Ranger Phil or the camper.
267,BOBBY:,What's that?
267,SAM:,"Looks like a -- yeah, that's a -- that's a cat's head."
267,BOBBY:,"A glamper or two is one thing, but you got to be damn hungry to eat a cat's head."
267,SAM:,Mm-hmm.
267,BOBBY:,"Well, lookit here. I'm no Dr. Oz, but..."
267,BOBBY:,I think that's his adrenal glands.
267,SAM:,Okay. And?
267,BOBBY:,Meant to be the size of hotel bar soap... and bright orange.
267,SAM:,"Ooh! All right, that might help explain the strength. Um, but whatever this thing is, it's not the Jersey Devil, but it sure as hell ain't Gerald Browder anymore."
267,DEAN:,"Okay, guys, seriously. It's time for dinner?"
267,SAM:,"Gerald Browder, 35, self-employed. Air-conditioning repairman."
267,SAM:,Missing person number three. Disappeared eight days ago.
267,BOBBY:,"Well, that explains all the people who got eaten in the last eight days."
267,SAM:,"Yeah. Question is, what happened to him?"
267,SAM:,"Dean. Uh, so, what do you think?"
267,DEAN:,[talking with his mouth full] I'm not that worried about it.
267,BOBBY:,Excuse me?
267,DEAN:,"That's funny, right? I could give two shakes of a rat's ass. Is that right? Do rats shake their ass, or is it something else? Eh."
267,SAM:,Give me that.
267,DEAN:,"Whoa, whoa! Why?!"
267,BOBBY:,"There's some funky chicken in the TDK Slammer, ain't there?"
267,SAM:,Yeah.
267,DEAN:,This is stupid. My sandwich didn't do anything. I don't know what you think you're gonna find.
267,BOBBY:,"There's something wrong with you, Dean."
267,DEAN:,Are you kidding? I'm fine! I -- I actually feel great. The best I've felt in a couple months. Cas? Black goo? I don't even care anymore. And you know what's even better? I don't care that I don't care. I just want my damn slammer back.
267,SAM:,"Dude, you are completely stoned, just like Ranger Rick was."
267,BOBBY:,Just like the dinner rush back at Biggerson's. And everybody's loving the Turducken.
267,DEAN:,I think you pissed off my sandwich.
267,DEAN:,That -- that's in me?
267,SAM:,O-only half of it.
267,BOBBY:,Does that snot look familiar?
267,SAM:,"Okay, so whatever turned Gerry Browder into a pumpkin head... and is currently turning Dean into an idiot --"
267,DEAN:,I'm right here. Right here.
267,BOBBY:,Is in the Turducken Slammer at Biggerson's.
267,SAM:,Yeah.
267,BOBBY:,It's in the meat.
267,DEAN:,"If I wasn't so chilled out right now, I would puke."
267,SAM:,How's he doing?
267,BOBBY:,He's sleeping it off. Tryptophan coma.
267,SAM:,"So, you think he's okay?"
267,BOBBY:,"Yeah, he's all right."
267,SAM:,Good. So you don't worry about him?
267,BOBBY:,What do you mean? Before the Turducken?
267,SAM:,"Yeah. Yeah, I kind of mean more like, uh... more like ever since my head broke... and we lost Cas. I mean, you ever feel like he's -- he's going through the same motions but he's not the same Dean, you know?"
267,BOBBY:,How could he be?
267,SAM:,"Right, yeah, but what if --"
267,BOBBY:,"What if what, Sam? You know, you worry about him. All he does is worry about you. Who's left to live their own life here? The two of you --  aren't you full up just playing Snuffleupagus with the Devil all the live long?"
267,SAM:,"I don't know, Bobby. Seeing Lucifer's fine with me."
267,BOBBY:,Come again?
267,SAM:,"Look, I'm not saying it's fun. I mean, to be honest with you, I-I kind of see it as the best-case scenario. I mean..."
267,SAM:,"...at least all my crazy's under one umbrella, you know? I kind of know what I'm dealing with. A lot of people got it worse."
267,BOBBY:,You always were one deep little son of a bitch.
267,SAM:,"Wait, wait, wait. Here we go."
267,BOBBY:,"Well, I guess we follow him."
267,SAM:,"That's weird, right? I mean, national franchise like Biggerson's getting meat from a place that looks like it wholesales Hong Kong knockoffs."
267,DEAN:,Okay. Yeah. It's a little weird.
267,SAM:,"All right, well, I guess we wait till they close up shop, go take a look around?"
267,BOBBY:,Hang on.
267,SAM:,No.
267,SAM:,Edgar.
267,DEAN:,Leviathans.
267,DEAN:,Son of a bitch.
267,BOBBY:,What the hell is going on?
267,EDGAR:,"Put him with the others, if you don't mind."
267,EDGAR:,I'm back because of the experiment. What's happening? You said you were refining the formula.
267,EDGAR:,But it didn't solve our little issue with adverse reactions.
267,EDGAR:,Burn them.
267,EDGAR:,Dick is coming.
267,BOBBY:,How's your head?
267,DEAN:,"Well, I think the slammer's pretty much wore off. In between that and the 20 cups of coffee, I'm nicely tense and alarmed."
267,BOBBY:,I wasn't talking about that.
267,DEAN:,"Oh, Bobby, don't -- don't go all Sigmund Freud on me right now, okay? I just got drugged by a sandwich."
267,BOBBY:,I want to talk about your new party line.
267,DEAN:,Party? What are you talking about? I don't even vote.
267,BOBBY:,"""The world's a suicide case. We save it, it just steals more pills""?"
267,DEAN:,"Bobby, I'm here, okay? I'm on the case. What's the problem?"
267,BOBBY:,"I've seen a lot of hunters live and die. You're starting to talk like one of the dead ones, Dean."
267,DEAN:,"No, I'm talking the way a person talks when they've had it, when they can't figure out why they used to think all this mattered."
267,BOBBY:,"Oh, you poor, sorry... You're not a person."
267,DEAN:,Thanks.
267,BOBBY:,"Come on, now. You tried to hang it up and be a person with Lisa and Ben. And now here you are with a mean old coot and a van full of guns. That ain't person behavior, son. You're a hunter, meaning you're whatever the job you're doing today. Now, you get a case of the Anne Sextons, something's gonna come up behind you and rip your fool head off. Now, you find your reasons to get back in the game. I don't care if it's love or spite or a ten-dollar bet. I've been to enough funerals. I mean it. You die before me, and I'll kill you."
267,DEAN:,"We need to scrape some money together, get you a condo or something."
267,SAM:,Hey. Something's up.
267,BOBBY:,"Well, I'll be a squirrel in a skirt. It's Dick frigging Roman."
267,DEAN:,What? Who the hell is Dick frigging Roman?
267,REPORTER:,"Billionaire Dick Roman, seen here at a recent press conference, has been on the corporate-takeover warpath in the last several months and shows no signs of relenting."
267,REPORTER:,"Whether at the helm of his America's cup-winning yacht or one of his Fortune 500 companies, Roman has never shied away from the spotlight. Roman's record-breaking series of motivational seminars, ""When in Rome,"" have outsold every other money-making program on the market. A vocal member of the NRA and a steadfast supporter of the second amendment, Roman has started attracting some conservative political attention, as well."
267,DEAN:,Holy crap. What the hell is that?
267,SAM:,"That's one of the top 50 most powerful men in America, Dean."
267,DEAN:,Says here top 35 as of last month. Now it's all making sense.  Remember when Crowley kept going on about hating Dick? I thought he was just being general. Pfft!
267,BOBBY:,"Well, if the Leviathan got to him, then that means they're playing on a much bigger board than we were thinking."
267,SAM:,"So what, then? I mean, we can't exactly outgun them."
267,BOBBY:,"No, but we got the drop on them. Means we got a chance to figure out what these guys are really doing here."
267,DEAN:,Whoa. Where'd you get that mother?
267,BOBBY:,It's on loan from Frank's big brother collection. It'll pick up vocal vibrations from window glass at half a mile. It's time to find out what these ugly bastards are up to.
267,WOMAN:,And I'll reschedule with the Senator for lunch Tuesday. You can deal with the archdiocese in the afternoon.
267,DEAN:,They got him.
267,SAM:,"Dean, there are at least four Leviathans out there. We don't even know how to kill one."
267,DEAN:,"Well, it'll be quite a shock when we walk in through the front door, won't it?"
267,WOMAN:,"We'll have the jet on standby at O'Hare. Thursday morning, you close on the land acquisition in Gleason."
267,WOMAN:,And this came this afternoon.
267,WOMAN:,Sotheby's.
267,SUSAN:,Hmm?
267,BOBBY:,So you got Dick Roman.
267,BOBBY:,"Oh, you're hurting my feelings."
267,BOBBY:,What do you got there?
267,BOBBY:,I'd appreciate one right about now.
267,BOBBY:,"Oh, let's just cut to the chase. I clearly ain't worth the extra time I'm getting here."
267,BOBBY:,"Nah, they're too smart. They know they don't have the numbers. It'd be suicide. I've run my race. Could die worse."
267,BOBBY:,"Okay, sons of bitches. See what you're up to now. You're coming with me."
267,DEAN:,Go! Go!
267,SAM:,"Damn it, where's Bobby?"
267,SAM:,Bobby! Come on! Come on! Come on!
267,BOBBY:,Go! Go!
267,DEAN:,Son of a bitch! I'm glad you got in. He almost took your freaking head off.
267,SAM:,"Hey, Bobby, your hat."
267,SAM:,"Bobby? Oh, God. Bobby? Bobby?"
267,DEAN:,Bobby?!
268,SAM:,"Bobby? Bobby? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on."
268,DEAN:,"Sam, is he dead?"
268,SAM:,I’m checking.
268,DEAN:,Is he dead?!
268,SAM:,"Just drive, Dean! Bobby!"
268,DEAN:,"You gotta talk to me, Sam!"
268,SAM:,"All right, he’s breathing. There’s a pulse."
268,DEAN:,Keep him upright. Stop the bleeding.
268,SAM:,"I’m not an idiot, Dean! I know first aid for a friggin’ bullet to the head!"
268,SAM:,Hold on. Hold on.
268,DEAN:,"All right, Bobby, hang in there."
268,SAM:,Bobby! Just hold on!
268,DEAN:,"Well, I guess we found Phil."
268,BOBBY:,Wait a minute. Something’s not right here.
268,DEAN:,"Yeah, no kidding, Bobby. There’s a corpse in a tree."
268,BOBBY:,Something bad’s about to happen.
268,DEAN:,"Yeah, well danger’s kinda on the W2 – that’s why we got the guns."
268,BOBBY:,Or something bad’s happened already.
268,BOBBY:,Balls.
268,SAM:,Y-you want to tell us what’s going on?
268,DEAN:,"Yeah, what’s going on with your head?"
268,BOBBY:,I got shot in it!
268,DEAN:,You what?
268,SAM:,"Bobby, we’ve been with you all day."
268,DEAN:,"Yeah, I think we would have noticed if you took a bullet."
268,BOBBY:,"I didn’t take one here. I-I took one out there, i-i-in the real world."
268,DEAN:,You lost us.
268,SAM:,"Look, Bobby, you – you want to sit down, seriously?"
268,BOBBY:,"No, there’s something I gotta tell you. I-I... Dammit, I can’t get at it."
268,SAM:,"Well, it – it’s okay, take your time. We’re – we’re right here."
268,BOBBY:,I didn’t have time before to tell you what...
268,BOBBY:,...they’re cookin’ up. You need to know.
268,KAREN:,Well...
268,KAREN:,"... you just gonna stand there or hand it over, Bobby?"
268,BOBBY:,What the hell? Karen?
268,KAREN:,You were expecting Farrah Fawcett?
268,BOBBY:,No. She always calls first. [pause] That’s what I said the first time this happened.
268,KAREN:,What are you talking about? Gimme!
268,BOBBY:,Oh.
268,BOBBY:,This  – this is just like it was. You’re beautiful.
268,KAREN:,Quit sweet-talkin’ and come here.
268,KAREN:,I feel like we haven’t talked in ages.
268,BOBBY:,I know just how you feel.
268,KAREN:,"Listen, I have something I want to say to you. No excuses this time, okay? Just sit, Bobby."
268,BOBBY:,I know what night this is. I remember this.
268,KAREN:,I’ve thought about this a lot. I really...
268,KAREN:,Don’t make fun of me.
268,BOBBY:,I wouldn’t. But right now I gotta...
268,BOBBY:,I don’t remember a storm coming in the night this happened.
268,BOBBY:,Mother Mary. I’ve got a messed-up fruitcake.
268,KAREN:,"What, Bobby?"
268,BOBBY:,"Nuthin’. I gotta go. I’m sorry, darling."
268,KAREN:,"Bobby, wait! Don’t go."
268,RUFUS:,"Number-one trick, is act like you know what you’re doing, Bobby."
268,BOBBY:,Rufus?
268,RUFUS:,"What, I can’t give you advice now? All of a sudden you know everything? You know, I can always go wait in the car."
268,BOBBY:,"No, wait. I – I need your help. Bad."
268,RUFUS:,"Yeah, damn straight you do."
268,BOBBY:,"No, listen to me, Rufus. I’m gonna die!"
268,RUFUS:,"Oh, now that’s a realistic view of the mortality rate on a ghost hunt."
268,RUFUS:,"Whoa, whoa, Nellie, red line. All right, baby boy, here we go."
268,BOBBY:,"No, Rufus!"
268,RUFUS:,"Are you coming, Bobby? I mean, we’re not getting any younger here!"
268,BOBBY:,Coming.
268,MAN:,"Hello, Mr. Singer."
268,MAN:,Your time’s up.
268,BOBBY:,"So you’re my reaper, huh? You know, I’ve heard of you guy grabbing reapees in broad daylight and in their sleep, but I never heard of a reaper showing up inside a guy’s custard."
268,REAPER:,"You’re in a coma, genius. This is what happens. I climb in your “custard” and fish you out."
268,REAPER:,"Oh, you think you can lose me."
268,BOBBY:,Gonna try.
268,REAPER:,"I’ve got places to be, Singer, don’t waste my time."
268,BOBBY:,Might as well – while I got it.
268,REAPER:,You’re prolonging the inevitable.
268,REAPER:,I can find you anywhere! Even in this gin-soaked rat maze.
268,SAM:,"I'm just saying – look, you can't really compare."
268,DEAN:,I don’t even know you right now. There's not even a contest.
268,SAM:,It depends on the criteria.
268,DEAN:,"Survival is the only criteria, all right?"
268,DEAN:,"And when the crap hits the fan, it's not about who has skill. It's about who's the bigger badass. Bobby, will you please tell Sam that Chuck Norris could kick Jet Li's ass?"
268,DEAN:,You grab me a beer while you're in there?
268,WOMAN:,Bobby?
268,WOMAN:,"Bobby Singer, you had better be washed up when you come down."
268,RUFUS:,"Bobby, heads-up! Whew! Poor thing. Gets left at the altar, kills herself, and then gets buried in the crypt. Now she's going after men who break their girls' hearts. Poignant, am I wrong?"
268,RUFUS:,"Why you out of breath? Did you go for a jog up there, man?"
268,BOBBY:,"I need your help, Rufus."
268,RUFUS:,"Yeah, clearly."
268,BOBBY:,"No, listen to me."
268,RUFUS:,"I want you to grab a torch, man. As soon as I open up her coffin, showtime's coming pretty quick."
268,BOBBY:,"No. Will you listen to me, you son of a bitch? There's a damn reaper coming for me."
268,RUFUS:,"There's a damn reaper coming for all of us, Bobby."
268,RUFUS:,"All right, let's put this damn ghost to bed. I got plans for Purim."
268,DOCTOR:,Page the neurosurgeon on call. Tell OR to put electives on hold.
268,DOCTOR:,Move trauma 2 to bed 7 as soon as it's clean.
268,NURSE:,"Gunshot wound to the right frontal area, no exit wound found. Breathing spontaneously. Respiratory rate 18 and shallow. RST at 120. BP 90 over 60. GCS 5."
268,DOCTOR:,Push 80 grams of Mannitol over 30. Prep for intubation.
268,NURSE:,Air entry clear to bases.
268,DOCTOR:,Let's get a central line in here now.
268,SAM:,What's happening? Please just tell us –
268,DOCTOR:,Get them out of here.
268,NURSE:,Sorry. You need to stay out of their way.
268,DEAN:,That's our uncle.
268,NURSE:,You got to stay back.
268,SAM:,What are they doing?
268,NURSE:,We need to get him stable.
268,DEAN:,"Okay, when are you gonna take the bullet out?"
268,NURSE:,"If we can get the swelling down, if it's in a place we can get to, if –"
268,SAM:,If he even lives that long.
268,BOBBY:,Forget it. I got to keep moving.
268,GHOST:,Heartbreaker.
268,DOCTOR:,Push 30 more of Mannitol over 10. CBC and 'lytes. Bolus him with 500 saline.
268,NURSE:,The vitals were stable two minutes ago.
268,DOCTOR:,"Well, he's crashing now."
268,RUFUS:,Bobby... Come on. You okay? Say something.
268,BOBBY:,Look out!
268,NURSE:,Blood pressure 130 over 90.
268,BOBBY:,"Okay, Rufus, I need you – Oh, balls. This would be the one job you damn near got yourself killed on. Well, you're gonna be useful, even if I have to carry you."
268,DOCTOR:,"He's, uh, stable for the moment. Just have to see."
268,BOBBY:,Rufus...
268,BOBBY:,Where the hell did you go?
268,BOBBY:,"Yeah, you! You, kid! Hey, what are you making like a white rabbit all over the place for, you grubby little – enough with the jump scares, kid. Who are you running from?"
268,BOBBY:,Wait a minute. I know you.
268,RUFUS:,Did you think I was dead?
268,RUFUS:,"Call me, all right?"
268,RUFUS:,"Don't sit Shiva for me yet, Bobby."
268,BOBBY:,"Listen – after Bridezilla took you out, do you remember what you told me about your near-death experience?"
268,RUFUS:,"I haven't told you nuthin’ yet. But now that you mention it, pretty sure I almost crossed over."
268,BOBBY:,And what did you see?
268,RUFUS:,"What did I see? What are you so riled up about, paco? All right, all right. I saw a hallway, uh, plaid carpet, uh, the apartment building from when I was a kid."
268,BOBBY:,And?
268,RUFUS:,"And I wanted out. I'm not dying on no damn plaid carpet. No, thank you."
268,BOBBY:,"So, what did you do?"
268,RUFUS:,"Well, obviously, Bobby, not being stupid, I started looking for the damn exit door. Y-you know, I swear that's what they mean about your life flashing before your eyes, 'cause every time I opened the door, there was another chapter inside – the good, the bad, the bloody."
268,BOBBY:,"So, how did you get out?"
268,RUFUS:,"Found the right door, obviously."
268,BOBBY:,"Well, how did you find it?"
268,RUFUS:,"Oh, simple – I went deep."
268,BOBBY:,Deep. Like old?
268,RUFUS:,"No, deep like... Crap you do not want to think about, so you bury it, you shove other crap over it, and you don't go there, ever."
268,BOBBY:,"So, you're telling me that the way out was through your worst memory?"
268,RUFUS:,"It's an important door, Bobby."
268,BOBBY:,"Okay, this is good."
268,RUFUS:,"What the hell are you going on about, anyway?"
268,BOBBY:,"This. I got to find the right door to get this to Sam and Dean. I'm in a coma, Rufus, right now."
268,RUFUS:,[laughs] Get out.
268,BOBBY:,"I got shot in the dunce cap, Rufus. I'm – I'm dying."
268,RUFUS:,You sure?
268,BOBBY:,Unfortunately.
268,RUFUS:,"I'll be a prima ballerina. Wait, wait, Bobby. Are you trying to tell me I'm just one of your better memories?"
268,BOBBY:,Would I make this up?
268,BOBBY:,Okay. I got to go.
268,RUFUS:,What?
268,BOBBY:,"You're coming with me, Rufus."
268,RUFUS:,What?
268,BOBBY:,I need my partner on this. Please.
268,RUFUS:,"Aim for your worst memory. Think. Focus. You got it? The worst, okay?"
268,BOBBY:,I got a metric ton of worst.
268,RUFUS:,"Just take a shot. By the way, killer bride – how come she call you a heartbreaker, anyway? I mean, you a family man if I ever saw one."
268,BOBBY:,Thanks for narrowing things down.
268,KAREN:,"I can't believe you. I hate you. Everything's a lie. Our whole life, our vows... everything. You knew I wanted kids. Why didn't you just sit me down and say... I don't understand. You're a good man. You'd be a good dad. What does that even mean, you break everything you touch?! What kind of excuse is that?!"
268,KAREN:,Aah!
268,KAREN:,"Just stay away from me! You broke my heart, Bobby! You happy? Just go away!"
268,BOBBY:,Just so you know... I'm sorry. I never stopped being sorry.
268,RUFUS:,"Bobby, I thought you'd want a gang of rugrats."
268,RUFUS:,"So, how long after this..."
268,BOBBY:,"...did she get possessed? Three days. Biggest regret of my life, this fight. You'd think it was when I had to stab her to death, but... no. All through that... I was thinking we never got to get past this. If I'd have known, I'd have said anything she wanted to hear."
268,RUFUS:,Bobby? Hey. Try the door. Now.
268,BOBBY:,"Thanks, Rufus."
268,BOBBY:,Balls.
268,RUFUS:,What year is this? '89-ish?
268,BOBBY:,What's it matter? I'm still stuck in eternal friggin' sunshine.
268,RUFUS:,"No, I was just thinking, man – you look pretty good there. Must've drank less."
268,RUFUS:,"You know, for a guy who'd rather break his wife's heart than give her a baby, you make a hell of a nanny."
268,BOBBY:,"Shut up, Rufus. We need another door."
268,BOBBY:,Let's go.
268,RUFUS:,"Seriously, though, Bobby, how come –"
268,BOBBY:,"Dog with a bone, Rufus."
268,RUFUS:,"No, I really want to know, man – why no kids?"
268,BOBBY:,"Ain't that deep. Dad was a mean drunk. I figured I'd be just like him. And, hey, look – I was right. No sense passing on the legacy."
268,RUFUS:,"Man, you're too hard on yourself. You're more of a cranky drunk. You do know that whatever you're trying to avoid with the eye rolls and the grump-a-lumping – that's exactly where you need to go."
268,BOBBY:,I ain't avoiding nothing.
268,RUFUS:,"Yeah, sure."
268,BOBBY:,"Get off my ass, Rufus."
268,RUFUS:,"Hey, Bobby, I'm trying to help you here, okay? You want to get out of here, or you want to die?"
268,BOBBY:,I'm trying. How am I supposed to know what I don't want me to know?
268,RUFUS:,"What? Now, you can't tell me that wasn't gnarly enough to go spelunking in."
268,BOBBY:,That was any given Tuesday night. Believe me – it was nothing special.
268,RUFUS:,"No, no, no. You're scared."
268,BOBBY:,"No, I ain't. I just know we're in the wrong place, Rufus."
268,RUFUS:,"You – Okay, Bobby, you don't have time. That sound was not the weather, and you know it. We can't keep bopping through your greatest hits forever. That reaper's gonna catch up. I mean, if there was some way to stop the damn thing... But it's a reaper, Bobby. You're screwed."
268,BOBBY:,I know what we're gonna do.
268,RUFUS:,What?
268,BOBBY:,We're gonna stop the damn reaper.
268,DOCTOR:,I'm sorry. We just have to wait. We'll see if the swelling goes down.
268,DEAN:,How long?
268,DOCTOR:,It's hard to say in cases like this.
268,DEAN:,"Well, he's lasted this long. That's something, right?"
268,DOCTOR:,"Well, yes. Listen – the bullet didn't shatter. Only one hemisphere of his brain was injured. These are all positive things. But...I don't want to give you false hope here. He's far from out of the woods. Most of the time, cases like this..."
268,SAM:,They die.
268,DOCTOR:,Right now it comes down to him. I'll keep you updated.
268,MAN:,Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. Is one of you Robert Singer's next of kin?
268,MAN:,We know this is a stressful time.
268,DEAN:,"Yeah, okay. No offense – you can skip the garnish. What, did his insurance lapse, or what?"
268,MAN:,"We're sorry to ask, but, um, did your uncle ever make his wishes known i-in regards to organ donation? Organs are only viable for a very limited window –"
268,DEAN:,"""Viable""?"
268,MAN:,We're just hoping some good can come of this tragic –
268,DEAN:,Listen to me. I'm gonna say this once. He's not gonna die. It's one bullet. He's gonna be fine because he's always fine.
268,MAN:,I apologize.
268,DEAN:,"Why are you talking to me like he's gonna die, huh? I do my job! Do your jobs! Save him!"
268,MAN:,Of course they're doing everything they can.
268,DEAN:,Walk away from me. Now!
268,DEAN:,Dick! I know you're in there. Come on out...
268,DEAN:,...you dick.
268,DEAN:,"What, did you come here to finish the job?"
268,DEAN:,"Yeah? Well, come on. Right here, right now, out in the open, you and me, Dick Roman."
268,DEAN:,See? Deciding to jump a famous guy ain't all upside. You can kill me right now – you want to see it online.
268,DEAN:,"We're coming for you, and not just to hurt you – to kill you. You understand me?"
268,DEAN:,"You're gonna wish you could, then."
268,DEAN:,"You're either laughing because you're scared or you're laughing because you're stupid. I'll see you soon, Dick."
268,BOBBY:,It's in an old King James Bible.
268,RUFUS:,"So, what exactly are we doing now, Bobby?"
268,BOBBY:,"Well, technically, you're correct. You can't stop a reaper, not permanently. Only their boss can do that, and we don't want him involved."
268,BOBBY:,Ah. Now we're cooking with gas.
268,RUFUS:,What is that?
268,BOBBY:,"Well, Sam and Dean have run up against these suckers a couple, three times. Picked up a few tricks – enough to slow them down a hair, at least."
268,RUFUS:,All right. Let's work some mojo.
268,SAM:,What did that guy want?
268,DEAN:,"Uh, nothing. Just some insurance mook. Dick Roman was out there."
268,SAM:,What? What happened?
268,DEAN:,Nothing...For now. It was just a friggin' staring contest. That was about it. What's the update?
268,SAM:,"The swelling's down a little. They took him off sedation. Apparently, he – he started fighting his tube. So they pulled them out, and he's breathing on his own."
268,DEAN:,"That's good, right? Is that good?"
268,SAM:,"Yeah. Well, doctor said best-case scenario."
268,DEAN:,"All right, so when they gonna take the bullet out?"
268,SAM:,"Dean, t-they're not even – they're not even gonna try that, not yet."
268,DEAN:,What does that mean?
268,SAM:,"The word's ""abrading,"" I think."
268,DEAN:,English.
268,SAM:,Cutting out the dead brain tissue.
268,MAN:,"I don’t know, Alex. I-I don’t know."
268,SAM:,That's if the doctor even thinks it's worth the risk.
268,WOMAN:,"You know, I, uh... You’re working..."
268,MAN:,I don’t know.
268,WOMAN:,I’m – I’m...
268,SAM:,Can I talk to you?
268,DEAN:,What? Talk about what?
268,SAM:,You know what.
268,DEAN:,"No, we're not gonna have that conversation."
268,SAM:,"Well, we need to."
268,DEAN:,He's not gonna die.
268,SAM:,He might.
268,DEAN:,Sam.
268,SAM:,"Dean, listen – we need to brace ourselves."
268,DEAN:,Why?
268,SAM:,Because it's real.
268,DEAN:,What do you want to do? You want to hug and – and say we made it through it when Dad died? We've been through enough.
268,BOBBY:,"We still need gold ore, hemlock, and mace."
268,RUFUS:,"Mm. So, pretty basic, then, huh?"
268,BOBBY:,What the hell?
268,REAPER:,Cute. Got to admit – first time anyone's pulled one on me while actually unconscious.
268,BOBBY:,"Well, get comfy."
268,REAPER:,Not so fast.
268,BOBBY:,Yeah? Sorry. Other business.
268,REAPER:,"I'm trying to help you, Bobby. You're going to die. Think you can stop it by pinning me like a bug?"
268,BOBBY:,Well –
268,REAPER:,"You've seen the dark coming – people disappearing, things going blank. Look around. Cell by cell..."
268,REAPER:,"...that bullet's killing your brain. You're running out of places to hide. So, understand – this trap won't hold forever, because this room won't hold, because you are going to die."
268,BOBBY:,You think.
268,REAPER:,Come with me. Be done. You've earned it. Or fight me. Stay here. And you know the drill.
268,RUFUS:,"I don't know, Bobby. I mean, you really want to get stuck, turn into some ghost?"
268,BOBBY:,"I know what I'm doing, Rufus."
268,RUFUS:,"Yeah, yeah, you're thinking you can help those boys. But how many spirits you meet in their right mind? Some hunter's gonna cut you down."
268,BOBBY:,Whose side are you on?
268,REAPER:,"Bobby... You've helped. You got handed a small, unremarkable life, and you did something with it. Most men like you die of liver disease, watching ""Barney Miller"" reruns. You've done enough. Believe me."
268,BOBBY:,I don't care.
268,REAPER:,Why?
268,BOBBY:,Because they're my boys.
268,BOBBY:,All right. The only way out is through.
268,BOBBY:,"Well, that's a load of crap. Who the hell were you to say?"
268,BOBBY:,"The day he deserves it, you drunken..."
268,BOBBY:,... bully. Punching women and kids – is that what they call fatherhood in your day?
268,BOBBY:,"I was a kid! Kids ain't supposed to be grateful! They're supposed to eat your food and break your heart, you selfish dick! You died, and I was still so afraid I'd turn into you I never even had kids of my own."
268,BOBBY:,"Uh-huh. Well, as fate would have it, I adopted two boys, and they grew up great. They grew up heroes. So you can go to hell!"
268,NURSE:,Keep the head of the bed up for transport. IV can run off the pump. Just run a TKVO. We'll have to wait for respiratory.
268,SAM:,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's happening?"
268,NURSE:,"He's showing signs of responsiveness. We're taking him up for surgery. If you want to see him, I'd squeeze in there quick."
268,BOBBY:,Hey.
268,BOBBY:,You did what you had to do. This is where you learn that... they pretty much never say thanks when you save 'em. Now go get a shovel. Bury the old man out behind the woodshed.
268,REAPER:,You got the only genetic case of bullet in the brain I've ever seen.
268,REAPER:,"Not so fast, Singer."
268,NURSE:,Sorry. We need to get moving.
268,SAM:,Right. Yeah.
268,SAM:,"Hey, um... Bobby, um, hey..."
268,SAM:,Just... thanks... for everything.
268,NURSE:,All right. Please step back.
268,DEAN:,Yeah.
268,SAM:,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop. His eyes are open."
268,DEAN:,Bobby?
268,SAM:,Hey.
268,DEAN:,What – don't talk. Don't talk. A pen – I –
268,DEAN:,"Here. Here, here, here."
268,DEAN:,What is it?
268,BOBBY:,Idjits.
268,DEAN:,Bobby? Hey!
268,NURSE:,Call a code – trauma room.
268,DEAN:,"You microbrewing in there, or what? Come on – we got a lot of Chuck Norris to get through. Let's go."
268,REAPER:,"Nice move, waking up like that."
268,BOBBY:,Motivation's a mother.
268,REAPER:,"You know why it's dark out there, don't you? This house – it's your last island, everything else melted by that bullet – gone. This is your last chance to come with me and move on. For your own good, Bobby, let go. They'll be okay without you."
268,BOBBY:,"Last memory, huh?"
268,BOBBY:,Glad I saved the best for last.
268,DEAN:,"All right, scoot, jerkface. Show your elders some respect."
268,SAM:,"You scoot, ass-hat."
268,SAM:,Mm.
268,DEAN:,Did we get licorice?
268,DEAN:,"I'm sorry. I didn't quite understand that, uh, Mr. Peanut-Butter-and-Banana Sandwiches?"
268,SAM:,You know what? I stand by that sandwich. Nobody likes licorice. I-it's – it's made of dirt.
268,DEAN:,It is a classic movie food. It's right up there with popcorn.
268,SAM:,Popcorn? Really?
268,DEAN:,Yes.
268,SAM:,You're out of your mind.
268,DEAN:,What – it's like little chewy...
268,REAPER:,"Well, Bobby? Stay or go – what's it gonna be?"
269,MAN:,Thank you.
269,MARLENE:,Sure. You've been here a couple nights in a row now.
269,MAN:,What can I say? I like the ambience.
269,MARLENE:,Get you anything else?
269,MAN:,"No, thanks."
269,MARLENE:,Thanks. Keep safe out there.
269,MARLENE:,"Hey, there. You lost?"
269,MAN:,What?
269,MAN:,Excuse me...
269,MARLENE:,"Ooh-hoo. You're looking a little Cabo Wabo, there."
269,MAN:,"No. No, I'm fine."
269,MARLENE:,"No. You're not. I slipped a little special sauce into your coffee while you were watching the skirt. You do know we're venomous, right?"
269,MARLENE:,Looks like I didn't dose you quite hard enough. That's okay. There's more where that came from.
269,MARLENE:,That's for the crappy tip.
269,SAM:,"Dean, you know, um... I wonder if – if we... I mean, should we be telling people? I mean, people he knew."
269,DEAN:,"How long ago did I give Frank these numbers? It's been a few weeks, right? What, is he nuts, or is he just being rude?"
269,SAM:,"Probably both. Dean, I-I got to ask you a question."
269,DEAN:,"Unless, of course, something happened to him. He can't get to the phone because a Leviathan ate his face."
269,SAM:,"Yeah, also a possibility."
269,DEAN:,We should go check on him.
269,SAM:,"Dean, do you want to call Bobby's people or not?"
269,DEAN:,W-why is – why is that our job?
269,SAM:,Because who else is gonna do it?
269,DEAN:,"I'm not calling anybody. If you want to, you go right ahead."
269,SAM:,I don't want to call anybody. You kidding me?
269,DEAN:,"Well, I'm not getting it."
269,SAM:,Hello?
269,SAM:,"Uh, no. He's, uh... I-I-it's not, but I'm a friend of his."
269,SAM:,"He's... not here, but, look, if you need s–"
269,DEAN:,Who was it?
269,SAM:,Just some kid.
269,DEAN:,For Bobby? Girl scout cookies?
269,SAM:,I think maybe...
269,SAM:,"Maybe a-a hunter's kid? I mean, she sounded pretty scared. You know, I have a caller ID. Maybe we should go find her. We – we can check on her."
269,DEAN:,What about Frank?
269,SAM:,"Well, Dean, I think we should go find this girl first."
269,DEAN:,"Sam, Frank's been working on the numbers that Bobby spent his last breath on, and you want to back-burner that?"
269,DEAN:,Fine. You go check out girl scout. I'll find Frank.
269,SAM:,"Fine. But you know what? On one condition – if Frank is just spinning his wheels, then you bail out on crazy and come meet me."
269,DEAN:,And thanks for drinking my entire beer.
269,SAM:,I didn't touch your beer. Mine's right there. You probably drank it without noticing.
269,DEAN:,Right.
269,SAM:,"Hello? Um, we...spoke on the phone earlier?"
269,SAM:,"Hi. Uh...I'm Sam. You sounded like you needed help, and I was in the area."
269,GIRL:,How'd you find me?
269,SAM:,Your dad is in Bobby's address book.
269,GIRL:,So where is he?
269,SAM:,"Bobby? He, uh... He's passed away. Look, um –"
269,GIRL:,Krissy.
269,SAM:,"Krissy. I get it. You don't let strangers in. But if your dad said you could trust Bobby, then you can trust me, too."
269,KRISSY:,"Just so you know, 911's on speed-dial. One button."
269,SAM:,"Yeah, sure. Note taken."
269,KRISSY:,"So... you're a salesman, too?"
269,SAM:,Yep. So your dad's on the road right now? Been gone a while?
269,KRISSY:,He usually calls every night.
269,SAM:,How long has it been?
269,KRISSY:,Five days.
269,SAM:,"It's just you and him, huh? I know how that is. Look, um... Sometimes on the road, crap happens. So I'll help you track him down."
269,KRISSY:,Really?
269,SAM:,'Course. Did he happen to say where he was going?
269,KRISSY:,Said he had a couple leads near Dodge City.
269,SAM:,And does he have a desk or something where he keeps his stuff?
269,SAM:,Do you mind making some coffee? Thanks.
269,SAM:,Krissy.
269,SAM:,"Hey, listen, so I think I got an idea where to start. So I'm gonna go. Um...Can I borrow this?"
269,KRISSY:,Yeah.
269,SAM:,"Thanks. Here. Here's a number, in case you don't hear from me in the next couple days. Don't worry. I promise I'll check in."
269,KRISSY:,Don't say that. That's what my dad said.
269,DEAN:,This can't be good.
269,DEAN:,Well... hi.
269,DEAN:,"Frank... we're amongst friends here. Okay, acquaintances."
269,FRANK:,That's just what a Leviathan would say.
269,DEAN:,Frank. I'm not a Leviathan.
269,FRANK:,"Oh, sure. You're not a Leviathan. Dick Roman's not a Leviathan. Gwyneth Paltrow is not a Leviathan."
269,DEAN:,Yeah?
269,FRANK:,Trust me.
269,FRANK:,"They're anywhere, anyone. Who's to say this ain't the day they come for old Frank who knew too much?"
269,DEAN:,"They bleed black goo, right? You want to see what I bleed?"
269,DEAN:,"Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's take the guns out of it, okay?"
269,FRANK:,Okay.
269,DEAN:,See? Red-blooded American.
269,DEAN:,Now...
269,DEAN:,Your turn.
269,FRANK:,"Oh! Whoa. Look, I'm obviously not –"
269,DEAN:,"Fair's fair, douchebag."
269,DEAN:,Yeah.
269,DEAN:,I'm glad we could share that together.
269,FRANK:,"Grab your gun, come with me. For God's sake, don't make any noise."
269,DEAN:,Why the downsize?
269,FRANK:,"You! ""Hey, Frank, go dig up some dirt on Richard Roman."" That night, I was burned off every IP I had. Ears on my phones, eyes on my house..."
269,DEAN:,Wait – Dick's got people watching you?
269,FRANK:,"Do I look like I know? You think it's easy to see this deep into what's real and also be bipolar with delusional ideation? There is no pill for my situation, sweetiepop, so, yeah, best guess – the bigmouths are onto me. Next question."
269,DEAN:,"All right. Well, what's the word on the bigmouths?"
269,FRANK:,"Their tentacles are everywhere. I-I'm looking at bankers, military high-ups..."
269,DEAN:,This is why you didn't call me back.
269,FRANK:,"Hey, cut me some slack. You called me like four days ago."
269,FRANK:,"What? No. Really? Days, weeks – quit busting my chops."
269,DEAN:,"What, are you kidding me?"
269,FRANK:,"You cool your heels, Buster Brown."
269,DEAN:,"Frank, I paid you fifteen grand for this."
269,FRANK:,"Yeah, I get that –"
269,FRANK:,"Look, I'm sorry about Bobby. I really am. You know, this one time, we were in Fresno, and we got stuck –"
269,DEAN:,"No. No, no, no. I'm not gonna play ""this one time with Bobby"" crap, all right? I'm not gonna get all warm and fuzzy with somebody else who barely knew him."
269,FRANK:,Just trying to make friendly conversation.
269,DEAN:,"This is not a friendship, Frank. I'm paying you!"
269,FRANK:,"Hey. You know what you need? A little LSD, a little shiatsu –"
269,DEAN:,I'm out of here.
269,FRANK:,"Hey, you want to know what those numbers are? Bupkis. They're not lottery numbers, license –"
269,DEAN:,"I know that, Frank. Thank you."
269,FRANK:,Which leaves us little else to do but probability generate.
269,DEAN:,Come again?
269,FRANK:,"You run most reasonable possibilities for a Levi-related five-digit number written by a dying drunk, you come up flat. Know what you start to wonder? ""Hey, maybe I'm missing a number."""
269,DEAN:,"Well, how do you figure?"
269,FRANK:,"Oh, I don't know. Because Bobby was dying of brain trauma. I just had a tickle there was a reason nothing was popping out at us, so I set up a program to run possibilities for six numbers, seven, eight. But good news."
269,DEAN:,Good news?
269,FRANK:,"Never had to go past six, because this..."
269,FRANK:,"...my little lamb, is coordinates."
269,DEAN:,You sure? To what?
269,FRANK:,A field in Wisconsin.
269,DEAN:,"No. No, Bobby didn't give us coordinates to some patch of weeds in Cheeseville."
269,FRANK:,"No, he gave you coordinates to a parcel recently purchased by Willman, Inc., a subsidiary of [FRANK makes a trumpeting noise] Richard Roman Enterprises."
269,DEAN:,So what do we do?
269,FRANK:,"Stay away. Or, if we're stupid... we go there and set up surveillance."
269,SAM:,Cause of death?
269,SAM:,"So, what? Some kind of animal attack?"
269,FRANK:,Got the equipment arranged. Come and get your costume on. We can scoot.
269,DEAN:,"""Costume""? What?"
269,DEAN:,What the hell's so special about this place?
269,FRANK:,I love a mystery. Now get up in that cherry picker and act like you're fixing something.
269,DEAN:,I don't know how to drive that thing.
269,FRANK:,You think I do?
269,DEAN:,"Well, why do I got to be the sap that –"
269,FRANK:,"This one says ""manager."" That one says ""technician."" Sometime this month?"
269,DEAN:,Come on. Yah! Whoo!
269,DEAN:,Okay... aaah! Up. Moving. Aah.
269,FRANK:,"Oh, crap. Come on down, Tarzan!"
269,DEAN:,What?
269,FRANK:,Get down here. We need to move. They got this place wired up the wazoo.
269,DEAN:,They're watching us right now?
269,FRANK:,"Nah, nah, they're just watching Cheech and Ed from Ma Bell."
269,FRANK:,Right. So we need to tap into theirs instead.
269,DEAN:,"All right, now what?"
269,FRANK:,You look horrific. When was the last time you really slept a night?
269,DEAN:,"Let's just work, all right?"
269,FRANK:,This is it. We watch the screens. I can take the first shift. You're no use if you can't even...
269,FRANK:,Keep your eyes open.
269,SAM:,Excuse me. Your manager said that you might be able to help me.
269,MARLENE:,Sure. What can I do for you?
269,SAM:,You ever see this man?
269,MARLENE:,I...might have served him the other day. I think he may have gone to talk to that girl out there.
269,SAM:,Thanks.
269,SAM:,"Hey! Can I talk to you for a second, uh..."
269,SAM:,Sally? You ever see this man?
269,SALLY:,No.
269,SAM:,You sure?
269,SALLY:,It's not safe here. Somewhere private.
269,SALLY:,Something's happening around here. I'm afraid I'll be next.
269,SAM:,Tell me what you saw.
269,SALLY:,I don't know what I saw.
269,SAM:,"Sally, run!"
269,DEAN:,How long was I out?
269,FRANK:,'Bout 36 hours.
269,DEAN:,What? Why didn't you wake me?
269,FRANK:,Not your butler. Come see this.
269,DEAN:,What?
269,FRANK:,This is where it gets good.
269,DEAN:,"Frank, you need to get out more."
269,FRANK:,Not that.
269,FRANK:,Check out Sarah Palin.
269,DEAN:,Who is she?
269,FRANK:,Amanda Willer.
269,FRANK:,"Surprise, surprise – works for Richard Roman."
269,DEAN:,What was she doing?
269,FRANK:,"Being a naughty, bossy little girl."
269,DEAN:,"Well, I hate to ask for that in the non-porno version."
269,FRANK:,They're surveying. They're getting ready to build something.
269,DEAN:,Build what?
269,FRANK:,Exactly. What? No idea.
269,DEAN:,"Well, how do we find out?"
269,FRANK:,"We watch. Patience, grasshopper."
269,DEAN:,"Yeah, patience and me aren't exactly on terms."
269,FRANK:,"Well, then go out and kill something or whatever you kids do to blow off steam. What, you don't like my suggestion?"
269,DEAN:,"I don't think you're in a position to be giving suggestions, all right? I think you're one tinfoil hat away from a rubber room."
269,FRANK:,Did I mention you look awful?
269,DEAN:,Yes. Maybe because somebody I cared about just got shot in the head. And this is like shoving a rock up a hill. And – screw you.
269,FRANK:,Here's my advice you didn't ask for – quit.
269,DEAN:,What?!
269,FRANK:,You want to keep going?
269,DEAN:,I want Dick Roman on a spit.
269,FRANK:,But you're gonna drive yourself into the ground first. Good plan.
269,DEAN:,[after a pause] I'm not gonna quit. It's not even an option. I'm not gonna walk out on my brother.
269,FRANK:,"Okay, then, fine. Do what I did."
269,DEAN:,What? Go native? Stock up on C-rations?
269,FRANK:,"No, cupcake. What I did when I was 26 and came home to find my wife and two kids gutted on the floor. Decide to be fine till the end of the week. Make yourself smile because you're alive and that's your job. Then do it again the next week."
269,DEAN:,So fake it?
269,FRANK:,"I call it being professional. Do it right, with a smile, or don't do it."
269,FRANK:,What's the guff?
269,DEAN:,He –
269,SAM:,Venom?
269,SAM:,"Yeah. Well, um... I was out there looking for you. Lee Chambers?"
269,SAM:,I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's. Krissy called. She – she's fine. She is. She's just worried about you. So how do we get out of here?
269,LEE:,I don’t know. They'll be back pretty quick here.
269,SAM:,Just the two of them?
269,LEE:,"Yeah, they're a tag team. One of them knocks you out. The other one dumps your rig or your ride or whatever miles down the road. It's a pretty nice system they got."
269,SAM:,They've been draining you.
269,LEE:,"Yeah. They tap you three, four times, you're dead. And let me tell you... you can't see... you can't walk. I thought they'd kill me right off, but they don't have to. They got nothing to worry about."
269,SAM:,How many times they fed on you?
269,LEE:,Three.
269,KRISSY:,Did Sam tell you where he was going?
269,DEAN:,That's what I'm trying to figure out. What did you tell him?
269,KRISSY:,Uh...He checked my dad's room.
269,DEAN:,There?
269,KRISSY:,Yeah.
269,DEAN:,"Look, I really don't have time to hold your hand here, so –"
269,KRISSY:,What are you saying?
269,DEAN:,I'm saying go wait in the living room. Your dad may not want you to know every single thing about him.
269,DEAN:,Where is it?
269,KRISSY:,You mean everything about the job my dad was working?
269,DEAN:,Sam said you didn't know.
269,DEAN:,"All right, I get it. You're a tough kid. But I'm trying to get Sam and your dad back."
269,DEAN:,I'm coming back.
269,KRISSY:,I'm coming with you.
269,DEAN:,"N-no. No. Hell, no."
269,KRISSY:,I'm coming! Or you're not going.
269,KRISSY:,Ow!
269,DEAN:,Now hand it over.
269,KRISSY:,I can't. I burned it.
269,DEAN:,You what?
269,KRISSY:,"But lucky for you, I memorized it all first."
269,KRISSY:,"Hey, I have a question."
269,DEAN:,"All right, here's the deal. I'm a fun guy. I'm actually awesome. Okay? But right now, I'm not in the mood. I'm neck deep in some serious crap, and if this wasn't an emergency, I would drop your ass off at the nearest mall."
269,KRISSY:,What serious crap?
269,DEAN:,"Revenge crap, all right? Now shut up. Eat a cookie or something."
269,KRISSY:,"One thing doesn't make sense, though. My dad's a pretty great hunter, and your brother's the size of a car, so... So how'd this thing get 'em both?"
269,DEAN:,Vetalas usually hunt in pairs. Sam and your dad both assumed it was one thing hunting solo.
269,KRISSY:,Why'd they think that?
269,DEAN:,"Because they had the wrong info. Or, best available. Our dad took down a loner years ago. Sam has his journal. Your dad must've been going on the same facts."
269,KRISSY:,And you know different 'cause...?
269,DEAN:,"Sam was away at Stanford, smartass."
269,KRISSY:,Sam went to college? I thought you said your dad was a hunter.
269,DEAN:,"You could, too, you know – go to college. Be a hunter/pediatrician."
269,SALLY:,Hunter day at the all-you-can-eat. How's everyone feeling? Good?
269,SALLY:,Strong silent. Fine. I don't need much entertainment with my meal.
269,SAM:,"Hey, Sally, uh, did I tell you about the Vetalas I took down in Utah? Yeah. You remind me of them. Except they were so much...younger."
269,SAM:,I tied 'em up. Not because I had to. More so... I could take my time.
269,SALLY:,You're lying.
269,SAM:,No. I just want you to know how much I enjoyed cutting up your sisters.
269,SALLY:,Shut up!
269,SAM:,Aah!
269,DEAN:,You ever actually work with your dad?
269,KRISSY:,Sure. 'Course.
269,DEAN:,"No, I mean work, not shoot cans in the woods."
269,KRISSY:,"I mean, I help all the time."
269,DEAN:,"So, no. Well, right about now, your stomach should be pretty knotted up."
269,KRISSY:,"Not really. Look, maybe this was a lot harder for you when you were my age."
269,DEAN:,"Oh, you think you're a good actress. You're not."
269,KRISSY:,What are you talking about?
269,DEAN:,"Well, I hate to break it to you, but it's all over your face – you're scared."
269,KRISSY:,Quit treating me like I'm some girl. I've been prepping for this my entire life.
269,DEAN:,Training's one thing. Doing – whole ’nother beast.
269,KRISSY:,"Wow. You really scared me straight. Thanks, Dean."
269,KRISSY:,Why is that waitress getting into that truck?
269,DEAN:,I'm not explaining the R-rated crap to you.
269,DEAN:,All right.
269,KRISSY:,What century is this? No one fist-bumps anymore.
269,DEAN:,Come on. Give it up. Good work.
269,KRISSY:,You're a dweeb.
269,KRISSY:,What the hell?
269,DEAN:,I got an idea.
269,DEAN:,How 'bout you stay here?
269,KRISSY:,"Oh, you jackass."
269,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, I'm the jackass who ain't bringing a kid in there, period."
269,KRISSY:,Why? I can do everything you can do.
269,DEAN:,I'll bring them back. Trust me.
269,KRISSY:,"Please, they're probably dead."
269,DEAN:,You don't know that.
269,KRISSY:,"It's been days. Probably just a pile of meat. I've seen it. People die, Dean. I watched my mom get torn to shreds. Let me go in there and kill them."
269,DEAN:,No. Sorry.
269,KRISSY:,You're such a hypocrite. How come you get to do it and I don't?
269,DEAN:,Because I'm the grown-up!
269,DEAN:,Give it to me.
269,KRISSY:,What?
269,DEAN:,Thank you.
269,MARLENE:,Good thing we picked up a new one. This one's about tapped out. You want to finish him together?
269,SALLY:,Sure. Love to.
269,MARLENE:,Not so fast.
269,KRISSY:,"Dad, hold on – I got you!"
269,LEE:,No!
269,SALLY:,Let her go... or Little Miss Sunshine here gets it.
269,LEE:,"What were you thinking, bringing her here?"
269,SALLY:,Now drop the knife!
269,DEAN:,She's just a child. Let her go.
269,SALLY:,"Yeah, I don't think we'll be letting anyone go."
269,KRISSY:,Daddy...
269,LEE:,"It's okay, baby. Everything's gonna be fine."
269,MARLENE:,All right. Enough with the family bonding. It's time for you to shut up.
269,KRISSY:,"Daddy, no! Dean!"
269,SALLY:,He can't help you. No one can.
269,KRISSY:,"I guess I'll have to help myself, then."
269,KRISSY:,"Bad actress, huh?"
269,DEAN:,"Yeah, I take it back."
269,LEE:,"Yeah, I was hoping you'd stop by. I wanted to thank you."
269,SAM:,It's no problem.
269,LEE:,"No, you saved my life. Krissy's, too."
269,SAM:,"Actually, uh, she kind of saved ours."
269,DEAN:,"Don't thank us. Quit. Your daughter's 14 years old. She's already a hunter with a-a kill under her belt. I'm not trying to be a dick, but what do you think that does to her life span? She could still be a regular kid."
269,LEE:,"You know, I got into this for a reason."
269,DEAN:,I know. Your family. That's the same reason you should get out now.
269,LEE:,I can't. You ever know anyone who left the life?
269,DEAN:,No. They all get killed first.
269,SAM:,"Well, uh... we should probably let you get some rest."
269,LEE:,Yeah.
269,KRISSY:,"Dean! Thanks for saying bye, asshat."
269,DEAN:,"Oh, what? Now you're sentimental?"
269,KRISSY:,No. Just wanted to tell you that you're kind of amusing for an old man.
269,DEAN:,"How'd you get out of them cuffs, anyway?"
269,KRISSY:,Girl's got to have her secrets.
269,DEAN:,"Bobby pin. You know, you could've gotten yourself killed."
269,KRISSY:,I saved your bacon.
269,DEAN:,My point stands. But yes.
269,KRISSY:,So... Guess I'm retiring – one and done.
269,DEAN:,Really? How you feel about that?
269,KRISSY:,Who knows? Maybe I'll go to Stanford like Sam.
269,KRISSY:,We're so lame.
269,DEAN:,"Yeah, we are. Take care of yourself."
269,SAM:,You know what? Good for them.
269,DEAN:,Yeah. It's nice to walk away from someone and feel like they could be okay. How about you? How you doing? You all right?
269,SAM:,"No. I'm definitely not. But, you know, I mean, um, I think, maybe... I just want to work."
269,SAM:,Should I even ask?
269,DEAN:,I'm fine.
269,SAM:,"""Fine,"" meaning...?"
269,DEAN:,"You're right. We should just... work, right? And figure out a way to kick Dick Roman's ass. Well, hey, we are the professionals."
269,DEAN,All right--
269,DEAN,"Yeah, that'd be nice, wouldn't it?"
270,DEAN:,"All right, let's do this. Move fast."
270,SAM:,"Wait, wait, wait. What's the plan exactly?"
270,DEAN:,Don't die.
270,DEAN:,"He's heading downtown. All right, you take the street. I'll take the alley. I'll meet you in the middle."
270,DEAN:,Son of a...
270,SAM:,Dean?
270,SAM:,Dean?!
270,DEAN:,Don't give me that dirty-diaper look. I ain't calling you.
270,SAM:,That was Sheriff Mills. She caught us one.
270,DEAN:,"Oh, I feel bad. We didn't get her anything."
270,SAM:,"I can't believe I'm about to say this but I hope you're watching cartoon smut, 'cause reading Dick Roman crap over and over again is just self-punishment."
270,DEAN:,"It's called anime, and it's an art form."
270,DEAN:,"Well, this looks nice. Check around back?"
270,SAM:,"Well, there’s a... semi-functioning bathroom and one un-rancid bedroom."
270,DEAN:,"Define semi-functioning, and do not use the words ""hole in the floor."""
270,DEAN:,How does paper beat a rock? It's stupid.
270,SAM:,Kids playing hide-and-seek found the body.
270,DEAN:,Wow. Very King Tut.
270,SAM:,"Yeah, so, uh, this is where the eyewitness to the assault lives, but the cops are calling him an unreliable witness."
270,DEAN:,Because?
270,SAM:,Let's find out.
270,DEAN:,"Special Agent Smith. This is, uh, Special Agent Smith. No relation."
270,MAN:,"Whoa. Do you mind if we, uh... My mom's sleeping in there."
270,MAN:,"S-so, how can I...?"
270,SAM:,"Oh, we, uh – we had a few questions about the incident you witnessed in the alley."
270,MAN:,You just gonna laugh at my story like the rest of the suits?
270,DEAN:,We're not gonna laugh at you.
270,MAN:,"All right, well, I'm on the steps... medicating... when I hear fighting. So I look. There's my neighbor Durbin, and some dude dressed like my grandpa's got him by the neck, right?"
270,DEAN:,What do you mean he looks like your grandpa?
270,MAN:,"Uh... Snappy shoes, suit, one of those, um, Justin Timberlake hats."
270,SAM:,Y-you mean a – a fedora?
270,MAN:,Aha!
270,SAM:,Did you see anything else?
270,MAN:,"This red, like, energy passed through Durbin to hat guy. Even my watch stopped. Durbs... he aged before my eyes. He looked like a raisin."
270,SAM:,"Well, we believe you."
270,MAN:,Oh!
270,DEAN:,Thanks for your help.
270,MAN:,"Thank you, officer – officers."
270,DEAN:,Wow.
270,DEAN:,Yep. Nothing that turns a dude into a Cryptkeeper. You?
270,SAM:,"Uh, well, greater Canton turns out kind of a hot spot for weird dead bodies."
270,DEAN:,Hmm. You don't say.
270,SAM:,Yeah. News archives.
270,SAM:,"They're not exactly reporting, uh, mummifies. But still, uh – 1928..."
270,SAM:,"...three deaths cited as spontaneous combustion. Bodies, quote, ""shriveled despite no signs of fire."""
270,DEAN:,"Little stretch, but okay."
270,SAM:,'74...
270,SAM:,"...three bodies found with leathery decay. Uh, '57..."
270,SAM:,...three more –
270,SAM:,Severe dehydration. This time one made the front page.
270,SAM:,Girl named Terry Cervantes found a corpse near her church.
270,DEAN:,Any pattern here other than the location?
270,SAM:,"Random vics, random years. But they seem to drop in threes."
270,DEAN:,"That's two down, one to go. All right, let me drive for a sec."
270,SAM:,"What, are you gonna look up more anime, or are you strictly into Dick now?"
270,DEAN:,Hmm.
270,SAM:,Are those local feeds?
270,DEAN:,Yeah.
270,SAM:,How did you do that so fast?
270,DEAN:,"A little tutorial from Frank. Don't worry. We'll pretend this never happened. Now, mummy numero dos was, uh,  found at the Gas n' Sip near Main Street, correct?"
270,SAM:,Yeah.
270,DEAN:,"All right, well, here's all the cameras around that store."
270,SAM:,You need to teach me that trick.
270,DEAN:,"Hey, check it out – Timberlake."
270,SAM:,Wait a sec.
270,DEAN:,"You can't let me bask in the glory for one second, can you?"
270,SAM:,Shut up. Look.
270,DEAN:,"He hasn't aged a day, has he? All right, well, if he's been popping up for decades now, then somebody's bound to know who he is, right? Is there any chance that, uh, Terry's still local?"
270,TERRY:,"You know it's so pretty in the spring. Everything's blooming. That's why I walked home that way – to see the flowers. Instead, I found that body. I still have no idea what could have done that to a person."
270,DEAN:,Do you recognize that man?
270,TERRY:,"Yeah. I mean, he lived on my parents' street. Mr. Snider."
270,DEAN:,Where'd you say your parents live?
270,DEAN:,"So, what exactly is this thing? Some sort of vampire who got too sucky?"
270,SAM:,"Nope. Coroner's reports said there was blood in both bodies. 300-year-old blood, but blood."
270,DEAN:,"Dude, dude. Uh, fedora dude."
270,DEAN:,"All right, let's do this. Let's move fast."
270,SAM:,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the plan here, exactly?"
270,DEAN:,Don't die.
270,DEAN:,"He's heading downtown. All right, you take the street. I'll take the alley. I'll meet you in the middle."
270,DEAN:,Son of a...
270,DEAN:,Hey!
270,DEAN:,Hey!
270,DEAN:,Hey!
270,POLICEMAN:,"Hey, you! Drop the gun! Put it down! Drop the gun!"
270,DEAN:,All right.
270,DEAN:,"Okay, can I just –"
270,POLICEMAN:,"Don't. Listen to me. Hey, if you tell me you're from the Bureau one more time, I'm gonna air you out myself. Got it?"
270,POLICEMAN:,"""No signal."" Are you some kind of Jerry spy?"
270,DEAN:,Jerry who?
270,POLICEMAN:,And a terrible one at that.
270,POLICEMAN:,"This badge was issued 68 years from now. Ace work, kraut-muncher."
270,DEAN:,'44? I'm stuck in 1944?!
270,POLICEMAN:,"We're all stuck in 1944, ya bunny."
270,MAN:,Take a powder.
270,POLICEMAN:,"Yes, sir."
270,DEAN:,"Look I don't even like frigging sauerkraut, okay, so you can just skip the –"
270,MAN:,What happened in the alley? And paint me a real picture.
270,DEAN:,"All right, well, I'm ""twelve monkeyed"" no matter what I say, so here goes. I was chasing this dude. Uh, I'd just seen him mummify a guy. Yeah. So, I jumped him. He lights up red. Poof, we're in 1944."
270,MAN:,Tell me more about the red light.
270,DEAN:,Are you seriously asking –
270,MAN:,"You want out of this jail, you're gonna tell me everything you can about that man and the so-called light."
270,DEAN:,"Okay. I saw it, and then we were here."
270,MAN:,"Would you say that, uh... it was all around you or that more that it came from inside this fella?"
270,DEAN:,You believe me. Are you...? You're a hunter.
270,MAN:,I don't know what you're talking about.
270,DEAN:,"Demons, ghosts, shifters. Hey, I've killed 'em all. And you're the same. Just 68 years before me, huh?"
270,MAN:,And your name is...?
270,DEAN:,Dean...Winchester.
270,MAN:,Ness. Eliot Ness.
270,DEAN:,"I-I got to tell you, I mean, ""Untouchables"" is, like, one of my most favorite movies ever."
270,DEAN:,"I must have seen that thing, like, 50 times."
270,DEAN:,"Oh, yeah, yeah! You don't even know! Oh, you are – pbht!"
270,DEAN:,"No, no, no. It's, uh, not normally on the menu. Trust me. I'm as surprised as you are that I'm here."
270,DEAN:,Awesome.
270,DEAN:,In threes.
270,DEAN:,But you already know that.
270,DEAN:,"Okay, so, so, wait, uh... Does... does this mean that I'm an Untouchable now?"
270,DEAN:,Stiff your br –  bin – what?
270,WOMAN:,"What's the rumpus, Eliot?"
270,DEAN:,Hey.
270,EZRA:,Who's he? Some farmer clown?
270,DEAN:,"Yeah. Gas costs four bucks. You can get cheese out of a spray can.  And... the President, he's a black guy. I could go on."
270,EZRA:,Paint me impressed. I assume you need some clothes. Come on.
270,SAM:,"Hey, let me, uh – let me help you with those."
270,SAM:,Seriously?
270,DEAN:,Awesome.
270,EZRA:,"""Awesome""? You some religious kook?"
270,EZRA:,"So, spill already. What bucket of syrup did you two idjits step into?"
270,EZRA:,"Something funny, sweetheart?"
270,DEAN:,"No, you, uh... You just kind of remind me of someone."
270,EZRA:,Delightful.
270,SAM:,Is that a – is that a ring on his finger?
270,SAM:,I know that symbol.
270,EZRA:,It's the infinite hourglass.
270,DEAN:,That's the symbol I saw on his ring.
270,EZRA:,"Yeah, that's the mark of Chronos."
270,DEAN:,Who?
270,SAM:,The God of time.
270,SAM:,"The thing is, with the Old Gods, once upon a time they were – they were just short of invincible. But they got a lot of their mojo from worshippers, from people feeding them."
270,SAM:,"Right, they're not what they used to be. But they make up for lack of power with being twice as pissed and a lot more hands-on."
270,EZRA:,Could be he's killing folks for his time juice.
270,DEAN:,"All right, well, how the hell am I gonna ride him back to 2012?"
270,EZRA:,"Well, you could let him grab you, if you don't mind him using you for gasoline."
270,SAM:,Best stab? We find a way to summon a God.
270,EZRA:,"No trouble at all. Come in a few hours, see what I can scrounge up."
270,DEAN:,Is the Chicago way.
270,EZRA:,"""Chicago way?"""
270,DEAN:,Sean Connery.
270,EZRA:,Come on.
270,DEAN:,Never watch that movie again.
270,DEAN:,It looks empty. You got a lock pick?
270,DEAN:,"He's using the ""Biff strategy."""
270,DEAN:,He's – Chronos is betting on races he already knows the outcome of.
270,DEAN:,Look at this.
270,DEAN:,Yeah.
270,DEAN:,What's L.Y.?
270,LESTER:,"Hey! W-whoa! Hey! Hey! Easy with the jacket! Yeah, I ain't talking. I'm no stoolie."
270,DEAN:,I learned it from watching you.
270,DEAN:,Lester. That a German name?
270,LESTER:,"Hey, okay, okay. There's no need to snap your cap. W-who you looking for?"
270,LESTER:,"What, that guy? I mean, bum never missed a bet, but he gave me the heebie-jeebies, so I cut him off."
270,LESTER:,T-the Early Bird! It's a dive on Haggerty. Practically lives in the joint.
270,SAM:,Damn it.
270,SAM:,"Okay, yours sounds better. You first."
270,SAM:,And I've got the spell to do it right here.
270,SAM:,"'Cause calling Chronos isn't the problem. It's making sure we summon him when Dean is right there... Literally with his hands on the guy, so he can surf him back."
270,SAM:,"No, it's more like we need to get the time on their end right to the exact second."
270,SAM:,And he's trapped there forever.
270,SAM:,"Rufus, a family friend."
270,SAM:,Wonder what they were betting over?
270,SAM:,Yeah.
270,SAM:,It'd be rude not to.
270,DEAN:,That's him.
270,DEAN:,"Thought you were, uh – thought you were Mr. Boy Scout."
270,DEAN:,"So, now, w-who died in your life and made you a hunter?"
270,DEAN:,And you got the bug.
270,DEAN:,I used to do it 'cause that's what my family did.
270,DEAN:,"But they just seem to keep dying. To tell you the truth, I don't know why I'm doing much of anything anymore."
270,DEAN:,Hey.
270,DEAN:,Sweet merciful awesome.
270,DEAN:,Talk to me.
270,DEAN:,That's it?
270,EZRA:,"That is a 1,000-year-old olive carved by vestal virgins and dipped in the blood of – you don't want to know. Pulling this together wasn't easy. You and Ness both owe me, smoothie."
270,DEAN:,You can have whatever you want...
270,DEAN:,...soon as we gank this thing.
270,EZRA:,"Yeah, yeah. Take your twig, wise guy."
270,DEAN:,"Well, now, how's it work?"
270,EZRA:,"You stick this end in his heart. Miss, he has you for supper. Make sense?"
270,DEAN:,"Wait, if I – if I kill Chronos... I'm stuck here."
270,EZRA:,"You just now realized? Oh, come on. 1944 ain't so bad."
270,DEAN:,"Yeah, I could head over to Europe, punch Hitler in the neck."
270,EZRA:,"Oh, there's lots of ways to pass the time, sugar."
270,EZRA:,That's for luck.
270,EZRA:,'Cause I'm lucky.
270,DEAN:,Thanks.
270,DEAN:,"""Back to the Future III."""
270,DEAN:,I need to borrow some paper.
270,CHRONOS:,"Mr. Ness, I presume?"
270,CHRONOS:,"You know, I stopped by the police station to take care of that hunter who rode me here. I heard you took him out of jail. I thought I might see you again."
270,LILA:,Ethan?
270,LILA:,"There you are. Can't take the trash out without the trash, silly."
270,CHRONOS:,"Sorry, honey. I don't know where I left my head. Be right there."
270,CHRONOS:,"Sweetie, I want you to pack a bag."
270,LILA:,Excuse me?
270,CHRONOS:,"Well, you're always asking me where I go. Come with me tonight."
270,LILA:,Is...is everything okay?
270,CHRONOS:,"Yeah, everything's perfect. You're perfect. I just need you to pack a bag and I'll explain why on the way, okay?"
270,LILA:,But the diner –
270,CHRONOS:,"[raising his voice] Forget about them! [in a more normal tone] We'll call them tomorrow, okay? Just go. Pack."
270,DEAN:,Jackpot.
270,DEAN:,"Yes, sir. I am, uh, Special Agent Costner with the, uh..."
270,DEAN:,...Department of Homeland Termite Invasion.
270,DEAN:,"Yes, sir. There's been an outbreak all over this area, and I just want to do an inspection, make sure that the, uh, perimeter's secure."
270,DEAN:,Okay.
270,DEAN:,"What?! Oh, yeah – no! No, no. Not to worry, because I'm going to install something that will protect this house forever."
270,DEAN:,Yeah.
270,SAM:,"Uh, that's okay. I can, uh..."
270,SAM:,Just read!
270,SAM:,Look at the top.
270,SAM:,"So, now we know the exact date Dean had hands on Chronos. All we need is the exact time."
270,SAM:,Hoping...
270,SAM:,...we ask someone who was there.
270,LILA:,"Oh, can you get ""The Sullivan Show""? I want to watch that Frankie Valli."
270,LILA:,Oh. Is Michael in trouble again?
270,LILA:,I told him not to read those comic books.
270,LILA:,Ethan. That's Ethan.
270,LILA:,Of course. November 1944 – the night the clocks stopped.
270,SAM:,Th-the clocks stopped?
270,LILA:,11:34. Every clock in the house.
270,SAM:,"Ma'am, can you tell us anything else you remember?"
270,LILA:,Ethan... said awful things. And then... and then he strangled that poor man.
270,SAM:,What poor man?
270,LILA:,Two policemen came to arrest Ethan.
270,SAM:,"Ma'am, was this one of them?"
270,LILA:,Ethan choked the life out of that man.
270,DEAN:,Ness! Ness!
270,LILA:,Ethan!
270,Sam:,"Here, break this."
270,CHRONOS:,Please don't hurt her.
270,LILA:,"Ethan, what's happening?"
270,DEAN:,"Yeah, Ethan. What the hell?"
270,CHRONOS:,"Lila, I'm sorry, but, you just – everything I said to you is true –"
270,DEAN:,"Oh, he might have left out a few details. He tell you he's a monster who jumps through time?"
270,CHRONOS:,"[shouting at DEAN] I'm a God! [speaking to LILA] Look, I'm not a monster. Listen. I'm the opposite."
270,LILA:,What?
270,CHRONOS:,"It's not like that. I do it for you, Lila."
270,LILA:,I don't understand.
270,DEAN:,"Well, he's not as strong as he used to be. Isn't that right, Ethan? Now you got to suck people dry. Wild guess – it takes three kills to juice you up."
270,CHRONOS:,"Sacrifices. Three sacrifices, and I can control when and where I land. But once I get there, it's never for long before I'm tossed through time again. That's my life, Lila. And all I want is to get back here."
270,CHRONOS:,"Because I love her! Because I lived the worst existence you can imagine, and then I found you."
270,CHRONOS:,"Yes, I did."
270,CHRONOS:,"I-I used to wander, but now I have you."
270,LILA:,I knew Cathy. She used to come into the diner every day.
270,CHRONOS:,"Lila, please."
270,LILA:,You are a monster.
270,CHRONOS:,"No, Lila, please!"
270,CHRONOS:,No!
270,SAM:,Hey!
270,CHRONOS:,"[shouting] No! [to DEAN, who is still on the floor, with JODY MILLS behind him supporting his head] You! Destroyed everything!"
270,SAM:,"Hey, Chronos?!"
270,SAM:,Was that the best you got?
270,CHRONOS:,You want to know your future? I know your future.
270,CHRONOS:,It's covered in thick black ooze.
270,CHRONOS:,It's everywhere.
270,CHRONOS:,They're everywhere.
270,CHRONOS:,Enjoy oblivion.
270,SAM,(taps on his phone) All right. (gasps) They're still in the business. Let's just hope they're still in that kind of business.
271,MAN:,"Barb, that you?"
271,SAM:,Morning.
271,DEAN:,Hey.
271,SAM:,Is that Bobby’s?
271,SAM:,I didn’t know you kept that.
271,DEAN:,"Yeah, mine sprung a leak."
271,SAM:,"You know, most people would just carry a – a photo or something for a memento."
271,DEAN:,"Shut up, man. I’m – I’m – I’m honoring the guy, all right? This is, uh, grief therapy, kind of like you and your wild-goose chase."
271,SAM:,Wild-goose chase?
271,DEAN:,Yeah.
271,SAM:,"Four guys murdered in two weeks, hands and feet cut off."
271,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, some guy with a foot fetish run amuck."
271,SAM:,Grown men thrown so hard they went through walls. Did you – did you even read the article?
271,DEAN:,"No, I was napping."
271,SAM:,"Well, anyway, what else you got going on? Dick Roman’s a dead end for now, you might as well –"
271,DEAN:,Stay busy.
271,SAM:,Exactly.
271,DEAN:,Yeah.
271,DEAN:,"Ugh, hours suck. But, uh, great benefits package."
271,DEAN:,Yeah. 10% co-pay on all drugs.
271,DEAN:,"No, no. Name brands are cool."
271,DEAN:,Yeah.
271,SAM:,So. What’s our boy here weigh?
271,DEAN:,"And all vics are male, right, with the same kind of, uh, artwork as this?"
271,SAM:,"So, uh, DNA left at any of the scenes?"
271,DEAN:,Right.
271,SAM:,"So, we have a match?"
271,DEAN:,Didn’t match any person in the database?
271,DEAN:,Hmm.
271,DEAN:,I’ll admit it could be in the general vicinity...
271,DEAN:,...of the ballpark of our kind of thing.
271,SAM:,"Yeah, uh, “didn’t match anything human” usually seals the deal for me. I don’t know, I’ve never seen this symbol before."
271,SAM:,"Let’s get a bite to eat, go back to the motel, haul out the laptop."
271,DEAN:,"That’s a great idea. Actually, that’s a brilliant idea. Here’s my counter. You do that, I’ll go undercover, go mingle amongst the locals and see, uh, what kind of clues bubble to the surface."
271,SAM:,You’re going to a bar.
271,DEAN:,Wow. If you want to oversimplify it.
271,WOMAN:,"Uh, dinner and a movie, which sounded fine, except the movie was “Human Centipede.”"
271,DEAN:,"What, so wait, uh, so you had a problem with that?"
271,WOMAN:,The date from hell.
271,DEAN:,"Dating, right? Ugh."
271,WOMAN:,But what’s the option? I don’t see settling down any time soon.
271,DEAN:,"Well, that’s something you don’t hear every day."
271,WOMAN:,"[Laughs] Oh, what, are you ready for the big commit?"
271,DEAN:,Me? [chuckles] Not exactly.
271,WOMAN:,"Nice suit, by the way. Guys don’t dress up much. I like it."
271,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, it’s, uh, a conservative line of work."
271,WOMAN:,What line is that?
271,DEAN:,Investment banking.
271,WOMAN:,"Oh, God."
271,DEAN:,[to waitress] Thanks.
271,WOMAN:,I hear the hours are ridic.
271,DEAN:,Yeah.
271,WOMAN:,But there’s money to be made.
271,DEAN:,I’ve had a fortunate year.
271,WOMAN:,Well.
271,WOMAN:,May you have many more.
271,DEAN:,Arigatou.
271,WOMAN:,You speak Japanese?
271,DEAN:,"Ah, enough to get by."
271,WOMAN:,"Well, look at you."
271,DEAN:,"Yeah, look at me."
271,WOMAN:,You want to move this conversation elsewhere?
271,MAN:,Hi. What can I do for you?
271,DEAN:,Ugh.
271,SAM:,You look like crap.
271,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, I feel worse than I look. I do recommend the Cobalt Room, by the way. Awesome night. Although I think I'm getting too old for this."
271,DEAN:,"Did you, uh, figure out that symbol?"
271,SAM:,"No. Um, we're gonna need an expert."
271,DEAN:,Expert? Our expert's dead.
271,DEAN:,"Well, nice decor. Very early slaughterhouse."
271,CHARLENE:,"More of the same. Uh, no forced entry. Thrown across the room. Made to suffer. Both hands and feet cut off."
271,SAM:,Same symbol in the chest.
271,CHARLENE:,Excuse me.
271,DEAN:,"This guy's just like the last one. Early 30s, decent-looking?"
271,DEAN:,Hmm.
271,SAM:,[to the POLICE OFFICER] Excuse me. I got it. [to the NEIGHBOR] How can I help you?
271,NEIGHBOR:,I was just trying to find out what happened. Jerry was a friend.
271,SAM:,I'm very sorry. Jerry was killed sometime last night. Do you live nearby?
271,NEIGHBOR:,Yeah. Two doors down.
271,SAM:,"You, uh, you know anyone who would want to harm Jerry?"
271,NEIGHBOR:,"No. He was the nicest guy in the world. Well, his – his wife wasn't real happy with him."
271,SAM:,Why's that?
271,NEIGHBOR:,"A few nights ago, he has a little one-night fling. Ann found out, took off. But... she would never do anything like..."
271,SAM:,Yeah. Of course. Thanks.
271,DEAN:,Who was that?
271,SAM:,Neighbor. Said the vic's wife caught him cheating.
271,DEAN:,"Yeah, but we're not thinking it's the wife."
271,SAM:,Not unless she benches 350 and did the other guys as a warm-up.
271,DEAN:,Shoot. I left Bobby's flask over at Lydia's.
271,SAM:,Lydia?
271,DEAN:,My workout partner from last night.
271,DEAN:,Now I've got to go get it.
271,SAM:,"So, not only do you know her name, you're actually gonna call her?"
271,DEAN:,Bite me.
271,SAM:,"Oh, how sweet – she gave you her number."
271,DEAN:,They always give you their number.
271,DEAN:,She's real busy.
271,WOMAN:,Breathe.
271,LYDIA:,
271,WOMAN:,"Control, Lydia. As in all things."
271,WOMAN:,One final push.
271,LYDIA:,Aah!
271,WOMAN:,The pain is an honor.
271,LYDIA:,What will we call her?
271,WOMAN:,You'll call her Emma. Next.
271,PROFESSOR:,"And actually, rather accomplished draftsmanship."
271,DEAN:,"Yeah, if you get past the fact that it was carved into a guy's body."
271,SAM:,"Professor Morrison, we're hoping you can tell us what the symbol means."
271,PROFESSOR:,"Ah, maybe."
271,SAM:,Maybe?
271,PROFESSOR:,"It's possible I could, even likely. Is the FBI offering suitable remuneration?"
271,SAM:,The respect of a grateful nation.
271,DEAN:,And a good word with the I.R.S.
271,PROFESSOR:,"Ah. Well, it appears quite ancient."
271,DEAN:,"Well, that narrows it down."
271,PROFESSOR:,"A corrupted version of symbology associated with worship. Definitely an obscure regional script. Oh, this will require some research."
271,SAM:,"All right. Great. Well, uh, I guess we'll be seeing you tomorrow."
271,PROFESSOR:,Tomorrow? [laughs] I've spent entire sabbaticals on a project like this.
271,DEAN:,Professor! We have a serial killer on our hands.
271,SAM:,"Your government needs you, sir."
271,PROFESSOR:,Gentlemen. My housekeeper needs a green card.
271,DEAN:,"Good God, where'd you find this guy?"
271,SAM:,He's supposed to be a top expert in his field.
271,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, when his field includes things that go bump in the night, he's gonna be worth the breath we just wasted."
271,SAM:,"So, what are we supposed to do, Dean? Spin our wheels?"
271,SAM:,"Dean, you know what? I want to call him, too, okay? Believe me. But Bobby's not here. So we're settling."
271,DEAN:,Yeah. We sure are.
271,DEAN:,"Damn it, why hasn't she called?"
271,DEAN:,I think you're enjoying this a little more than you need to. Screw it. I'm going over there and getting the flask.
271,LYDIA:,Don.
271,DEAN:,Dean. I guess you didn't get my messages.
271,LYDIA:,"No, I did. I've been busy."
271,DEAN:,"Oh. Anyway, I, uh, left that flask over here the other night."
271,LYDIA:,"Yes. I found it. It was so beat up and old, I almost tossed it."
271,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, guy it belonged to was beat up and old, too. But I was very close with him, and I'd, uh, I'd hate to lose it."
271,LYDIA:,I'll get it for you.
271,DEAN:,"So, how you been? Other than ""busy."""
271,LYDIA:,Just that. Really busy. Here you go.
271,DEAN:,"Oh, wow. I can see why you're busy. You've been babysitting, huh?"
271,LYDIA:,No.
271,DEAN:,Yours?
271,LYDIA:,Uh-huh.
271,DEAN:,You didn't tell me you had a little girl.
271,LYDIA:,There's probably all kinds of things we didn't tell each other.
271,DEAN:,What's her name?
271,LYDIA:,Emma.
271,DEAN:,"Hi, Emma. Your first?"
271,LYDIA:,Yes.
271,DEAN:,"Well, I hear they grow like weeds."
271,LYDIA:,You have no idea.
271,DEAN:,Oh. Sorry. I got to take this.
271,EMMA:,"Mom, get me out!  [?]"
271,LYDIA:,Shh. Just a minute. [?]
271,EMMA:,Who's that guy in the other room?
271,LYDIA:,Shh.
271,EMMA:,Who is that?
271,LYDIA:,Shh! Don't talk. We'll discuss it later.
271,CHARLENE:,What triggered the Feds' involvement in this case? I always think you boys have bigger fish to fry.
271,SAM:,"No. Actually, we – we – it’s –"
271,SAM:,
271,CHARLENE:,Yeah. Whatever. You're gonna have to wrap this up. Your case isn't the only one we're working on.
271,SAM:,"Uh, so, Eddie, by the way, I didn't bring the cold-case files with me. Is there a chance you have a copy?"
271,EDDIE:,Yeah.
271,SAM:,Great.
271,SAM:,The Cobalt Room.
271,EDDIE:,"Mm! Yeah, it's pretty well known. Looking to hook up, it's a pretty good place to go."
271,SAM:,I've heard.
271,EDDIE:,Vic number two was there.
271,EDDIE:,"And according to his security guard, he left with a hot girl. Two days later, he's an obituary."
271,SAM:,Same with Jerry Price.
271,EDDIE:,"Mm-hmm. And, uh, as far as we can tell, at least a couple of those in there."
271,SAM:,Same thing in Chicago.
271,EDDIE:,"Yep. A lot of busted marriages, flings with unknown women, that kind of thing, all just before they got offed."
271,SAM:,Thanks.
271,WOMAN:,Is Emma ready?
271,LYDIA:,Yes. Come in.
271,WOMAN:,Thank you.
271,SAM:,Nice talk.
271,LYDIA:,"Emma, hurry up. Come on, Emma. Time to go."
271,LYDIA:,Emma. You be a good girl. Make us proud.
271,EMMA:,"I will, momma."
271,LYDIA:,"Bye, Emma."
271,DEAN:,I hate when this happens.
271,SAM:,"So what? I mean, so maybe she has another kid she didn't tell you about."
271,DEAN:,"Nope, just the one. Emma. But that night, when I was with her, she didn't have any. And I was at her place, man. There was no playpens, no blankets, no rubber ducks."
271,SAM:,Right. Like you would have been focused on that kind of thing.
271,DEAN:,"Then, all of a sudden, boom – baby."
271,SAM:,"Yeah, the one you thought talked."
271,DEAN:,"Oh, it talked. And not baby talk, either."
271,SAM:,Now you know so much about child development?
271,DEAN:,"Lydia's handing this kid who's calling her mommy over to these two women, right? But this is not a baby. No, no, this kid's got to be five. And same name – Emma."
271,SAM:,"You know, George Foreman named all his sons George."
271,DEAN:,Are you deliberately messing with me?
271,DEAN:,"Dude, I know weird. Okay? There is no non-weird explanation for this. This morning, Emma was a baby. By sunset, she's Hannah Montana. Early years."
271,SAM:,It's the Professor.
271,DEAN:,"Oh. Good. The Professor. Yeah, I'm sure he'll crack this wide open."
271,SAM:,Shh!
271,WOMAN:,"On this special night, you join an exceptional family. You are ready to take your places alongside us and learn our traditions."
271,WOMAN:,This is a tribute to the one who created and protects us.
271,WOMAN:,We hunt for her. We kill for her. And now we consume that kill as a symbol of unity with those who have completed their blood missions and furthered the life of the tribe.
271,WOMAN:,"Go ahead, Emma. You need to eat."
271,PROFESSOR:,"You know, identifying the scroll was no day at the beach. Lesser scholars would have crumbled."
271,SAM:,Professor... the symbol?
271,PROFESSOR:,"It's a variation of a symbol associated with the Greek Pantheon, the temple of the goddess Harmonia. According to myth, the coupling of Harmonia and Ares, the God of war, produced the Amazons."
271,SAM:,The Amazons?
271,DEAN:,Like Wonder Woman?
271,PROFESSOR:,"No, like – like a tribe of warriors. They actually existed. The comic books – they're just silly perversions. The symbol –"
271,PROFESSOR:,"I believe it originated with the Amazons. Pictographs meant to pay homage to Harmonia – occult talismans, if you will. They had an exclusively female culture. No use for men whatsoever, except procreation."
271,SAM:,All the vics were male.
271,PROFESSOR:,So you said – with this symbol carved in their chests.
271,SAM:,And their hands and feet cut off.
271,DEAN:,Got our attention.
271,PROFESSOR:,"After they were impregnated, they killed the male – first cutting off certain body parts."
271,DEAN:,I know Bobby's got a Grecian encyclopedia of weird in here. I saw it last time I was looking through this stupid... Would it kill him to have a system?
271,DEAN:,You got anything?
271,SAM:,"Uh, yeah."
271,SAM:,There's this whole crazy side to Amazon lore that Professor Morrison didn't even mention.
271,DEAN:,"That's 'cause he doesn't believe in it, which is a real handicap when you're trying to deal with it."
271,SAM:,"[after a pause] Right. Um, apparently, there was this long, bloody war. The Amazon population was decimated, so they made a bargain with Harmonia to replenish their ranks and make them stronger."
271,DEAN:,"Well, I'd say throwing grown men through walls was stronger."
271,SAM:,"Yeah. Well, basically, they became more than human. Harmonia turned them into monsters."
271,DEAN:,Can you kill them like humans? Or is there some kind of trick?
271,SAM:,"Uh,  doesn't say. No idea. I guess it could go either way."
271,DEAN:,"Well, that's helpful. What else?"
271,SAM:,"The lore says they reproduced quickly – as in, after mating, they gave birth within 36 hours."
271,SAM:,"The babies grew incredibly fast, then the aging process became normal. Which is one way to make an army, I guess. The mating cycle is every two years. They send out all the women who have reached child-bearing age."
271,DEAN:,"Which lines up, 'cause this happens every couple of years in different towns, right?"
271,SAM:,Yeah. And we know for sure that at least some of the vics hooked up with strange women days before being killed Amazon style.
271,DEAN:,"Hooked up in the same bar I met Lydia, right?"
271,SAM:,Yeah.
271,DEAN:,And then suddenly...
271,DEAN:,...she's got a little baby in like fruit-fly time. That baby turns into a little girl just as fast.
271,SAM:,"Wow. So maybe you're – you’re, uh..."
271,DEAN:,Don't say it.
271,SAM:,"Look, if that kid's yours –"
271,DEAN:,I said don't say it!
271,SAM:,"Fine. I won't. But, Dean... Dude, seriously, a one-night stand, you're just gonna... roll the dice? You don't even –"
271,DEAN:,"Of course not... Sam. What, do you think I'm brain-dead? Accidents happen. If one even did, which I-I-I don't think..."
271,DEAN:,No. You know what? We’re – stop. We're not gonna talk about this anymore because my skin's starting to crawl!
271,SAM:,"All right, fine. But if it's true, if it happened..."
271,DEAN:,I know. I got to hang on to my hands and feet.
271,DEAN:,Looking through Bobby's files is like dumpster diving.
271,SAM:,"Yeah, tell me about it. So, it makes sense why, uh, why..."
271,SAM:,"... the Amazons all want to hook up with decent-looking, successful guys."
271,DEAN:,"Oh, they're picky about the gene pool?"
271,SAM:,Right.  So...
271,SAM:,...what was Lydia doing with you?
271,DEAN:,"Well, she may or may not have thought I was a rich investment banker."
271,DEAN:,Sam.
271,SAM:,Yeah.
271,DEAN:,These papers just moved.
271,SAM:,What?
271,DEAN:,I didn't touch them.
271,SAM:,It's all over the place.
271,SAM:,Redline. Redline.
271,SAM:,...that could have moved the papers.
271,DEAN:,Did you feel a breeze?
271,SAM:,"It doesn't matter, Dean. The readings are useless."
271,DEAN:,"Hey. Maybe, uh..."
271,SAM:,"We burned him, Dean."
271,DEAN:,So what?
271,SAM:,"So, what are you suggesting?"
271,DEAN:,I don't know. What are you?
271,SAM:,Concentrate on something else.
271,DEAN:,Why?
271,SAM:,Because it's [raising his voice and stepping close to DEAN] not Bobby!
271,DEAN:,Could be.
271,DEAN:,Why not?
271,DEAN:,Maybe it's useful.
271,SAM:,"It's in a pile of ""maybe it's useful."" Besides, it's in Greek. Nobody reads Greek."
271,DEAN:,"Yeah, except Greeks. Oh, and Bobby."
271,SAM:,And Professor Morrison.
271,DEAN:,Really?
271,SAM:,"I'm going, Dean. You stay here, keep the door locked. Don't go anywhere. I mean it."
271,DEAN:,Fine.
271,PROFESSOR:,"Oh, you have got to be kidding."
271,PROFESSOR:,I have office hours tomorrow –
271,SAM:,"I'm sorry, Professor. I need your help."
271,PROFESSOR:,The FBI isn't paying me enough for this.
271,SAM:,All right. I'll sweeten the deal. We'll remove your wiretap.
271,EMMA:,"Hi. You don't know me, but my name is Emma. I need your help. I think I'm in trouble, and you're the only person I can trust."
271,DEAN:,Why?
271,EMMA:,Because you're my father.
271,DEAN:,How'd you find me?
271,EMMA:,"They've been watching you, ever since Mom got pregnant."
271,DEAN:,"Well, if you're such a prisoner, you mind telling me how you escaped?"
271,EMMA:,I waited until lights out. The women who watch over us change shifts a little after 10:00.
271,DEAN:,Uh-huh. And you left because...?
271,EMMA:,"They stick you in there, and you trust them. It's all you know. And you don't question what they want you to do – terrible things. That's why I had to leave. They tortured me."
271,EMMA:,They told me I had to endure pain so I could be strong like them. But I don't want to be like them.
271,DEAN:,"Okay. Come on in.
EMMA enters the room. DEAN closes the door, replaces the security chain and puts his gun in the back of his jeans."
271,DEAN:,Have a seat.
271,DEAN:,Okay. Let's assume that you're not... like them. Yet.
271,DEAN:,What do you want me to do?
271,EMMA:,Get me away from here. You're a good man. My mother told me that.
271,DEAN:,"I seriously doubt she said that. And if you knew me, you would seriously doubt it's true."
271,EMMA:,They told me you're a hunter. So maybe you'll understand about me. Maybe you can protect me. Just long enough so I can get away. Then I'll leave you alone. I know you don't want me.
271,DEAN:,"All right, let's not... go there, okay? This isn't a matter of..."
271,DEAN:,"You get this isn't a normal situation, right?"
271,EMMA:,"How would I know? Three days ago, I wasn't even alive. Now here I am. My mother threw me into that place. And my father... well... You get this is my last chance to have anything normal ever, right?"
271,PROFESSOR:,It's fascinating.
271,SAM:,What's it say?
271,PROFESSOR:,"Oh, I haven't gotten there yet. The paper is handmade. A cellulose, rather like papyrus, which would explain its durability."
271,SAM:,Professor –
271,PROFESSOR:,Wherever did you get it?
271,SAM:,"Uh... a – a crazy, drunk, old genius."
271,PROFESSOR:,"Yeah. They always have the good stuff. Well, it's in Greek."
271,SAM:,"Yeah, yeah. I-I know that."
271,PROFESSOR:,"Not a common dialect. My God, what is it with you and Amazons?"
271,SAM:,"Professor, it's important."
271,PROFESSOR:,"At 11:30 at night, it better be.
Oh, here's a new twist. It repeats the conventional lore. Amazon warriors mate with males. The males are murdered. Yada, yada. But according to this... It's not the women who do the killing. Instead, a ritual of initiation requires that the child born of the mating process must kill her own father."
271,SAM:,What?
271,DEAN:,You look exhausted.
271,EMMA:,And starving. It's been a tough sweet 16. So you believe me?
271,EMMA:,You'll help me?
271,DEAN:,If you really want help.
271,SAM:,Detective.
271,CHARLENE:,Agent. You're here late.
271,SAM:,"Yeah. Listen, could we talk in the morning?"
271,CHARLENE:,What's your hurry...
271,CHARLENE:,...Sam? Sam Winchester. Let's see. I could run you in for impersonating a federal agent.
271,DEAN:,"Well, now, what happens when they find out you're missing?"
271,EMMA:,They may have already found out. And they'll hunt me down.
271,EMMA:,"Look, I know this is gonna be hard, but if I'm gonna get out, I have to do it now."
271,DEAN:,We got cheese and a leftover burrito.
271,EMMA:,Doesn't make a difference.
271,DEAN:,You were asking if I believed you.
271,EMMA:,I was told you'd be a challenge.
271,DEAN:,I figured you'd chat me up... try and catch me off guard. Almost worked. I was expecting your mother.
271,DEAN:,Is that what they told you?
271,EMMA:,It's what I am.
271,DEAN:,"Well, then, I should just kill you right now."
271,EMMA:,Sure. But you could have done that 30 seconds ago.
271,EMMA:,"It's weirdly hard, isn't it? It is for me."
271,DEAN:,Knock it off.
271,EMMA:,How could it not be? You're my father.
271,DEAN:,Hey! We're not gonna do that.
271,EMMA:,But it's true.
271,EMMA:,I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. So now someone has to kill someone.
271,EMMA:,"You know what? So far, my childhood's been kind of disappointing."
271,DEAN:,"You haven't killed anybody yet, Emma. Walk away."
271,EMMA:,I can't. I don't have a choice.
271,EMMA:,Please don't let him hurt me.
271,DEAN:,Here's the mother ship.
271,SAM:,Let's get this done.
271,DEAN:,They're gone.
271,DEAN:,"Hey, you know what? I don't like it, either. I wanted to torch ’em just as much as you. Yeah, but, hey... next time they surface, we'll be ready. If we live that long."
271,DEAN:,"All right, fine. Just sit there and be pissed."
271,SAM:,"Oh, the hell you were! You think I'm an idiot?"
271,SAM:,"Dean, you were gonna let her walk!"
271,DEAN:,"No, I wasn't. That's ridiculous!"
271,SAM:,"Look, man, she was not yours. Not really."
271,SAM:,"You know what? Bobby was right. Your head's not in it, man. When Cas died, you were wobbly, but now..."
271,SAM:,What?!
271,DEAN:,I don't know.
271,SAM:,"Look... Dean, the thing is, tonight... It almost got you killed. Now, I don't care how you deal. I really, really don't. But just don't – don't get killed."
271,DEAN:,I'll do what I can.
271,SAM:,"Well, what's that supposed to mean?"
271,DEAN:,It means I'll do what I can. All right? You can shut up about it.
272,SAM:,"[out loud to himself] It's okay. They can't hurt you. They can't hurt you. ""If it bleeds, you can kill it.""  Yeah. ""If it bleeds, you can kill it."""
272,DEAN:,I hope he finds something quick. This whole protocol du jour thing's really creeping my cheese.
272,SAM:,"So, we got dick on Dick?"
272,DEAN:,That's a vivid way of putting it. You find anything on Wonder Woman?
272,SAM:,No. And there probably won't be. They are definitely gone. But...
272,SAM:,...I might have found something over in Kansas.
272,DEAN:,"All right, well, let's do it. But, uh, a few simple rules, okay? No babies."
272,DEAN:,"In fact, no baby mamas. No bars. No booze – no hot chicks of any kind."
272,SAM:,"Wait, wait, wait. Did you just say –"
272,DEAN:,Ohh. Those are not the fun kind of hickeys.
272,DEAN:,And for those of us who skipped the enteroctopus class?
272,DOCTOR:,Giant Pacific octopus.
272,DEAN:,"How giant we talking, Doc?"
272,DOCTOR:,Approximately 30 feet.
272,SAM:,"I mean, aren't... giant octopi rare around here?"
272,DOCTOR:,Yet here we are.
272,DEAN:,"All right, so what happens? Guy comes home, cracks a beer, and gets... suckered to death?"
272,DOCTOR:,"Obviously, this was some kind of freak fetish attack. Someone created those hickey marks, then bled the man out."
272,DEAN:,That bite look a little vamp-y to you?
272,SAM:,"Yeah, no question."
272,DEAN:,So what are we looking for? An octovamp? A vamptopus?
272,SAM:,"That's crazy even for us, right?"
272,DEAN:,It does push the envelope. Let's go chat up the widow.
272,SAM:,"We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am."
272,DEAN:,"Mrs. Harper, we know this is, uh, bad timing. But we just have a few routine questions that we need to ask you – is that okay?"
272,SAM:,Did the house feel any different lately?
272,DEAN:,"Anything strange. Cold spots. Uh, did you smell anything weird? Maybe sulfury?"
272,DEAN:,"Okay, we're just ticking all the boxes here. Um, what about any skeletons in your husband's closet?"
272,DEAN:,"Can you think of anybody who would want to do him harm? A colleague, an old flame."
272,SAM:,The tiniest detail could really help.
272,SAM:,Um... Stacey?
272,DEAN:,"No, that's... Thank you. You've been a big help."
272,SAM:,"Really appreciate the hospitality, ma'am."
272,DEAN:,"Mom, dad, nanny – boy, that is a love triangle right out of Casa Erotica. 'Course, in those, the jealous wife tends to channel her feelings more productively."
272,SAM:,The only thing I can't wrap my mind around is –
272,DEAN:,"What, how wife lady summoned an octovamp?"
272,SAM:,"More like ""why?"" I mean, kind of impractical, right?"
272,DEAN:,"Yeah. All right, one of us needs to go talk to the naughty nanny."
272,DEAN:,"The other one stay here, shake down the place when the wife leaves – see what we're dealing with."
272,SAM:,All right. I'm on the nanny.
272,DEAN:,I'm on the nanny.
272,SAM:,I thought you said no hot chicks.
272,DEAN:,We don't know that she's hot.
272,DEAN:,"Now, uh, how would you describe your relationship with the deceased?"
272,NANNY:,"I don't know. Normal, I guess."
272,DEAN:,Normal?
272,NANNY:,"Well, I mostly dealt with Debra. There was nothing going on, if that's what you mean."
272,DEAN:,"Debra said that you were at the house late the night that, uh, that Brian died."
272,NANNY:,"Yeah. Brian was working late, so I stayed with Kelly. She was pretty upset."
272,DEAN:,Why's that?
272,NANNY:,"Well, it was her birthday. We had a party at Plucky's."
272,DEAN:,Plucky's. Why does that sound familiar?
272,NANNY:,"Plucky Pennywhistle's Magical Menagerie? Pizza chain for kids. Actually, more for lazy parents. Anyway, her dad showed up for five minutes, then he went back to work. And, of course, her mom was out of town. This stupid kid told Kelly her folks didn't really love her. She freaked. I was calming her down for hours."
272,DEAN:,"Uh, did you...notice anything weird at the house?"
272,NANNY:,Weird like...?
272,DEAN:,Anything. Even a bad feeling.
272,NANNY:,"No, nothing like that. Actually, Kelly does have a weird thing about closets. But it's just kid stuff."
272,DEAN:,Try me.
272,NANNY:,She thinks there's a monster in her closet. It drives everyone crazy.
272,SAM:,Whatcha working on there?
272,KELLY:,I know who you are.
272,SAM:,You do?
272,KELLY:,Mm-hmm. You're the guy that talked to my mom.
272,SAM:,That's right. I did.
272,SAM:,Something wrong?
272,KELLY:,My mom will get mad if I talk to you.
272,SAM:,Um... How come?
272,KELLY:,Because of what I told the police.
272,SAM:,And what did you tell the police?
272,KELLY:,I told them that I tried to warn my dad. That the monster would get him.
272,CLOWN:,Aah! Ha!
272,SAM:,"""If it bleeds, you can kill it."""
272,DEAN:,Huh.
272,DEAN:,"So, what, like a lance?"
272,DEAN:,Excuse me.
272,DEAN:,"Excuse me, ma'am? Agent Jones, FBI."
272,WIDOW:,I'm sorry. I – I really need to go.
272,DEAN:,"Okay. Uh, just one quick question, if you don't mind. Um, was yesterday your son's birthday?"
272,WIDOW:,Billy's birthday? No. Why would you ask that?
272,DEAN:,Nothing. Never mind.
272,WIDOW:,Oh. But... his father did take him to a friend's birthday party yesterday.
272,SAM:,
272,SAM:,I'm too old for this.
272,HOWARD:,"Welcome to Plucky’s, where all your dreams are good."
272,SAM:,"Could you just, uh, maybe..."
272,SAM:,...just get the manager for me?
272,SAM:,Okay.
272,WOMAN:,I just need you to stay sane for three more hours. Okay? Here. Finish your homework.
272,MANAGER:,"Real beauties, huh? We rotate them out once a week. Kids love having their art on the wall."
272,SAM:,"""Draw your worst fear""?"
272,JEAN:,I know. But we don't post the truly evil stuff – just the standard crap like sharks and ghosts.
272,JEAN:,"Jean Holiday, shift manager."
272,SAM:,"Johnson, FBI.  So tell me – why even ask the kids to draw creepy stuff to begin with?"
272,JEAN:,"It's just an exercise... some pop psychologist came up with. Plus, the owner's obsessed with ""aiding children's development."" So, the place mat is a safe way to get kids to talk about their fears. You know, we get them to sketch it in a little box, and – voila! – Plucky magically transforms it into rainbows and candy. Personally, I think it's a load of hooey, but they say that if these fears run wild, then it affects kids long into their adulthood."
272,SAM:,"Yeah, I've – I've – I've heard that. Um... so, I – I don't know if you'll remember, but there was a – a kid in here yesterday named Billy Pogue for a party?"
272,JEAN:,"Oh, the conniption kid."
272,SAM:,Conniption? He – he had –
272,JEAN:,"No, no, no, not him. He was fine. It was his dad. He pulls the kid away before cake and presents, and I guess the kid asked to stay for another five minutes. The dad pulls a full-frontal douchebag, starts screaming. Just embarrassed for the kid."
272,JANITOR:,Hey. [whistles again] Hey.
272,JANITOR:,You a cop?
272,SAM:,"Uh, yeah. I'm a Fed."
272,JANITOR:,"Uh, what are you investigating?"
272,SAM:,"Couple of crazy deaths. Why, is there something you want to share?"
272,JANITOR:,Look – not now. Too many eyes. Come back after closing.
272,DEAN:,"Hey. So, what's the lowdown with trauma town?"
272,SAM:,"I can tell you this much. Neither vic was up for parent of the year. Kelly's dad skipped her birthday, and Billy's dad pulled one of those Dick Parent scenes that makes everyone cringe."
272,DEAN:,What the hell are these?
272,SAM:,"Kid therapy. Um, you draw your worst nightmare – poof! – Plucky fixes it. Um, they hang them up on this big wall."
272,DEAN:,"Okay, so, Kelly draws a monster, and then that goes after her father? That's what we're saying?"
272,SAM:,"Well, here's the thing. They label those. And guess which two were missing. Well, name tag was there – no place mat."
272,DEAN:,Little Miss Octovamp.
272,SAM:,"Yeah. And... Billy. So... somehow, whatever he drew came to life and killed his dad, riding a horse."
272,DEAN:,"Close, but no Seabiscuit. See, I went and had a little chat with Billy. And he drew me this."
272,SAM:,Wait. So now unicorns are evil?
272,DEAN:,Yeah. Obviously.
272,SAM:,"Great. Well, now the question is, how did a unicorn come off a sketch and kill Billy's dad? How's any of this happening?"
272,JANITOR:,"Well, that's it for me. Guess I'll head out."
272,JEAN:,"Uh, one more thing. Some kid puked in the ball pit. It's gonna need a full sanitization. Do that, and then you can clock out."
272,JANITOR:,Aah! Aah.
272,DEAN:,"Hold on one second there, guys."
272,SAM:,Keep in touch.
272,SAM:,"Uh, thank you."
272,DEAN:,So?
272,SAM:,The manager found the body in the ball pit. Blood everywhere.
272,DEAN:,Cops have a theory?
272,SAM:,"Yeah, they think the ball washer did it."
272,DEAN:,The what?
272,SAM:,The... ball washer.
272,DEAN:,[smiling] The what?
272,SAM:,The ball –
272,DEAN:,Look at this.
272,DEAN:,"Thank you, gentlemen."
272,DEAN:,That's a shark bite.
272,SAM:,Yeah.
272,DEAN:,"And, uh, judging from the radius, I'd say a 20-footer, at least."
272,DEAN:,"""Shark Week,"" man. How do you not watch that?"
272,DEAN:,Whole week of sharks.
272,SAM:,Omar Cooper. How much you want to bet little Omar here was scared of sharks?
272,DEAN:,"Saul the janitor is connected how? I mean, he's not related to Omar."
272,SAM:,No. But Saul had something he wanted to tell me.
272,DEAN:,So this isn't about ganking some dickweed parent.
272,SAM:,"More like, uh, silencing a whistle-blower?"
272,DEAN:,"Great, so whatever we're looking for can literally fire off childhood fears at will. Wow. Watch out for evil lunch ladies."
272,SAM:,All right. Let's comb this place.
272,DEAN:,Seriously. Dractopus. Seabiscuit the impaler. Land shark – what's next?
272,LIBBY:,"Okay, Tyler, that's it. You got to take the bus from here."
272,TYLER:,But I thought –
272,LIBBY:,I can't. I'm sorry. I'm late.
272,LIBBY:,Here.
272,LIBBY:,Stay out of trouble.
272,SAM:,Maybe a... Tulpa?
272,DEAN:,"No, killings are too spread out."
272,SAM:,True. Um... angel?
272,DEAN:,"It's a little imaginative for the God squad, don't you think?"
272,SAM:,All right. So... what?
272,DEAN:,"Yeah, I don't know. I'm tapped out."
272,SAM:,"Well, whatever it is, at least we know where it is."
272,DEAN:,Plucky's!
272,SAM:,That's where the victims are getting picked up.
272,DEAN:,"Yeah, but we swept the place last night, and nada."
272,SAM:,"I can go back. Go to the employees, maybe dig up some dirt."
272,DEAN:,"What good's that gonna do? They think you're a Fed. The one guy who was gonna rat, he got Bruce'd. If anybody knows anything, they're not gonna tell you."
272,SAM:,"All right. 
SAM claps his hands once."
272,SAM:,Yep. That's the plan.
272,SAM:,"I'll go back, play bad cop, really lean into them."
272,DEAN:,And...?
272,SAM:,"And... when I'm done, then you watch them."
272,DEAN:,"So if somebody freaks out, then that's our creep."
272,SAM:,"Or he'll lead us closer, and you can track him."
272,DEAN:,"Well, what's my cover?"
272,SAM:,I don't know. Just hang back. Act normal.
272,DEAN:,"Yeah, yeah. Guy in his thirties hanging out at Plucky's alone – that's normal. That's not pervy at all."
272,JEAN:,"So, it doesn't matter what people say. We've roped it off. I've notified the powers that be. Everyone's aware."
272,JEAN:,Just no one goes in the...
272,SAM:,Hi.
272,JEAN:,Agent. I bet I know why you're here.
272,SAM:,How's business?
272,JEAN:,Turns out not even grim flippin' death can slow down the birthday fun.
272,SAM:,Oh.
272,JEAN:,"We roped off the ball pit, though, until corporate can get here. I just can't believe the machine fritzed and did Saul in like that."
272,SAM:,"Yeah, that makes two of us. I'm gonna need to talk to some of your employees."
272,JEAN:,Like who?
272,HOWARD:,"Howdy, friend."
272,DEAN:,Giant slinky. Would have killed for one of those when I was a kid. How much?
272,HOWARD:,"1,000 tickets."
272,DEAN:,American dinero. How much?
272,HOWARD:,"Oh, we don't take cash here at Plucky Pennywhistle's. Only tickets won through hard work and determination."
272,DEAN:,"You mainlined the kool-aid, huh?"
272,HOWARD:,It's double-ticket Tuesday if you play skeeball.
272,HOWARD:,"Howdy, friend!"
272,SAM:,"So, where were you last night?"
272,JEAN:,"Well, here. Obviously. I found him. But I was by the cash register the whole time. There's a security camera pointed right at the counter. The cops already looked at it."
272,SAM:,Uh-huh. And you heard nothing?
272,SAM:,"Yeah, right, right. So that's your excuse."
272,SAM:,What? How new?
272,JEAN:,Couple weeks. I just got promoted.
272,SAM:,"Hmm. So, uh, was there a lot of competition for the gig?"
272,JEAN:,"I guess. It comes with benefits. The bosses had us all write essays about how we would do our best for the kids, and they picked me. Don't be shocked, but I actually did two semesters at college, so... I'm not in any kind of trouble, am I?"
272,SAM:,I don't know. Why don't you tell me?
272,SAM:,Sure you wouldn't.
272,SAM:,Quiet.
272,TYLER:,Hey! Stop cheating!
272,DEAN:,You heard him. Knock it off!
272,LIBBY:,"Tyler, soup's on."
272,TYLER:,"But, Mom, I don't want –"
272,LIBBY:,Just eat it.
272,TYLER:,But it sucks!
272,DEAN:,"Hey, why don't you cut her some slack?"
272,TYLER:,What do you care?
272,DEAN:,Because I've been where you are.
272,TYLER:,Your mom made you camp at a stupid Plucky's after school?
272,DEAN:,"Y–  no. No, but my dad, he... hauled me places. Besides, she's working a tough gig."
272,DEAN:,"You know? She's exhausted. You should take pity on the old. And, hey, free grub."
272,TYLER:,That stuff tastes like butt.
272,DEAN:,"What? Come on, it can't be that bad."
272,DEAN:,Let's see here.
272,DEAN:,[with an “it’s not so bad” expression] Ah...
272,DEAN:,You scared of robots?
272,TYLER:,They have laser eyes.
272,DEAN:,Yes.
272,CHILD:,Excuse me.
272,HOWARD:,"Howdy, friend! What's your name?"
272,CHILD:,Evan.
272,HOWARD:,Hi.
272,SAM:,Lose the head.
272,SAM:,Why'd you do it?
272,SAM:,I think you know.
272,SAM:,"I'm the federal government, pal. I can do whatever I want."
272,SAM:,Dean!
272,DEAN:,Hey! Hey! Come here!
272,DEAN:,Hey!
272,DEAN:,"All right, look, uh..."
272,DEAN:,"Cliff. You're not using kids' nightmares to smoke people, are you, Cliff?"
272,CLIFF:,I don't...think so.
272,DEAN:,Get up.
272,CLIFF:,What's going on?
272,DEAN:,"All right, cards up. Yeah, we don't care that you, you know, broke bad or whatever. But there is some seriously weird going on in there."
272,CLIFF:,You mean the sub-basement.
272,SAM:,This place has a sub-basement?
272,CLIFF:,Sure. Door's out back. Easy to miss if you don't know.
272,DEAN:,What's in there?
272,CLIFF:,Alls I know is... Me and Saul used to come in after hours sometimes and... [laughs] You ever shroom in a ball pit?
272,CLIFF:,"Not that I...would, agents. It was Saul. Just Saul. All alone. Anyway... Sometimes we'd hear, like, spooky stuff, through the vents... Coming up from the boiler room."
272,LIBBY:,"Okay, kiddo. Let's go."
272,TYLER:,But somebody stole it!
272,LIBBY:,"[sharply] So, draw another one! Okay? We gotta go."
272,TYLER:,Okay. I'm sorry.
272,LIBBY:,Thank you.
272,TYLER:,That place mat sucked anyway.
272,SAM:,Dean. What? What is it?
272,DEAN:,"While you were out being Dirty Harry, uh, Tyler's mom got pissy with him, and now his place mat's missing."
272,SAM:,"So, what do you think?"
272,DEAN:,"I think the bitchy mom plus, uh, sad kid plus place mat with something nuts written on it... equals wacky corpse."
272,SAM:,"So you think she's next on the list? All right, I'll tail them just to be safe. You –"
272,DEAN:,Check the boiler room. I know.
272,SAM:,Right.
272,SAM:,"Oh. Oh. Uh, Dean, hey, uh, any idea what he drew?"
272,DEAN:,Robot.
272,SAM:,Robot?
272,DEAN:,"Yeah, about the size of a house. Shoots destructo beams out of its eyes."
272,SAM:,At least I'll see it coming.
272,DEAN:,Yeah.
272,DEAN:,"Now, that's perfectly normal."
272,HOWARD:,Drop it.
272,HOWARD:,Drop it!
272,HOWARD:,Mm-hmm. Now kick it over.
272,DEAN:,"Some pretty heavy hoodoo you got here. I gotta say, as far as I know, none of these things, uh, can poop out a Unicorn."
272,HOWARD:,"There's power in fear. And when a child draws what he's afraid of, a little of that mojo ends up on the page."
272,DEAN:,"So, what, you toss it in the fire, and some bed-wetter's horror show comes to life?"
272,HOWARD:,"I got to get something off the parent, too. Something they own. That bit gets tricky."
272,DEAN:,"Well, it hasn't seemed to slow you down."
272,HOWARD:,I'm just doing what I need to!
272,DEAN:,Okay. Okay. I get it. Okay?
272,DEAN:,No drawing... No Iron Giant!
272,HOWARD:,"Oh, that b-word is still on the list! But not tonight. Bigger fish."
272,DEAN:,"What, are you gonna shoot me, Howard? You really want a body on your hands? Blood everywhere?"
272,HOWARD:,"I’d shut up! 'Cause I got lots of ways to take care of bullies. Don't you worry. Like that FBI guy. He's your pal, right? I saw you chase Cliff down. Five minutes ago, his business card was torched. Along with something from my... personal collection."
272,HOWARD:,"I – I – I picked it out real special for him, too."
272,HOWARD:,Guy's got a real thing about clowns.
272,DEAN:,"Well, hey, these are, uh, really nice dolls. Did you..."
272,DEAN:,...paint them yourself?
272,DEAN:,"Oh.  Uh, friggin' Plucky."
272,HOWARD:,"Plucky helps kids. It's all I ever wanted to do. And when the management slot opened up, I... but they passed me over."
272,DEAN:,Shocker.
272,HOWARD:,"No, I told them, ""No one cares more than me."""
272,HOWARD:,But suits never listen.
272,HOWARD:,"So, I'm doing it my way."
272,DEAN:,"So let me get this straight. You didn't get the good parking space, so you start dropping bodies?"
272,HOWARD:,Those parents were horrible. They deserved what they got.
272,DEAN:,What about Saul?
272,HOWARD:,Saul had a big mouth!
272,DEAN:,"Some guy hits on the babysitter, all of a sudden he's the world's worst dad?"
272,HOWARD:,A good parent puts his kids first.
272,DEAN:,And having a little girl watch her pop get ganked by the closet monster – that's putting her first?
272,HOWARD:,"In the long run, they'll all be better off."
272,DEAN:,You think so? Really?
272,HOWARD:,I would have been.
272,DEAN:,"So, your brother. What happened to him?"
272,HOWARD:,It's not my fault! It's theirs!
272,DEAN:,Looks to me like he drowned.
272,HOWARD:,I was screaming... But my folks... They didn't listen. They never listened.
272,DEAN:,It was an accident.
272,HOWARD:,They let him die!
272,DEAN:,"I'll bet you still have nightmares. In fact, I'll bet you haven't been in the water since."
272,HOWARD:,Shut up!
272,DEAN:,Because you're afraid.
272,HOWARD:,No!!
272,HOWARD:,It wasn't my fault.
272,HOWARD:,I'm sorry.
272,SAM:,Let's roll.
272,SAM:,Go ahead. Say it.
272,DEAN:,I'm sorry.
272,DEAN:,You look like you got attacked by some PCP-crazed strippers.
272,SAM:,"Dude, one of them sprayed me with seltzer from his flower."
272,DEAN:,I'm s– whew. What?
272,SAM:,Nothing. Carry on.
272,DEAN:,Ohh. That's... Sam... I'm sorry for... psychologically scarring you.
272,SAM:,Which time?
272,DEAN:,"Shut up. Seriously. You know, me – me ditching you when we were kids, that was a dick move. You know, the whole clown thing–"
272,SAM:,"You know what, man? Honestly... getting my ass kicked by those juggalos tonight was, uh... it was therapeutic."
272,DEAN:,You faced your fear.
272,SAM:,Exactly. And now what else could a clown possibly ever do to me? I feel good.
272,DEAN:,"Well, congrats."
272,SAM:,"By the way, to celebrate..."
272,DEAN:,What?
272,DEAN:,No!
272,SAM:,Yes.
272,DEAN:,Did you win this?
272,SAM:,We earned that.
272,DEAN:,Ha ha!
272,DEAN:,"Hey. I got you a little something, too, actually."
272,DEAN:,What? You said you were over it. You can think of it as a... clown phobia sobriety chip.
273,SAM:,"Ms Havelock, you shouldn't have come."
273,DEAN:,"Yeah, your, uh, scooping days are over, Gomer. All you got to worry about now... is us."
273,DEAN:,You ain't the first demon we've tracked down on this safari.
273,SAM:,"That's right. As a matter of fact, I think you put us over half a dozen."
273,DEAN:,"Well, you're gonna help us with that."
273,SAM:,"Jeffrey? Jeffrey, is that you?"
273,JEFFREY:,Oh God. No. You have to stop him.
273,SAM:,"We will. We're going to, okay? We're gonna send that demon back to Hell."
273,JEFFREY:,Okay. Please don't hurt me.
273,SAM:,"Jeffrey, before we can let him go... Look, the demon knows where we can find more of his kind, okay?"
273,DEAN:,"See, we're hunting them – all of them. He's not gonna give up his Rolodex easy. Jeffrey, we're gonna have to cut in to him. That means you."
273,JEFFREY:,"Oh, the things he made me do to those women. Whatever you have to do... You have to do it. Please just stop this evil piece of..."
273,DEAN:,"You know, you were right. I like Jeffrey. He's a decent guy. In fact, he just signed off on his temple."
273,DEAN:,She's got other lieutenants. We already know that.
273,SAM:,We want names.
273,DEAN:,"Jeffrey? Jeffrey, you awake?"
273,DEAN:,"Hey, you passed out. You're in shock."
273,JEFFREY:,He's – he's gone?
273,DEAN:,"We exorcised him. Try not to move, okay? We're almost to the hospital."
273,JEFFREY:,Your... your brother?
273,DEAN:,"My brother stayed back to clean us out of that crime scene. There's no reason to go down for a demon's murders, you know what I mean?"
273,DEAN:,"All right. All right, take it easy. All right, you're good to make it from here, right?"
273,DEAN:,"Okay, Jeffrey, no demon talk in the E.R., you understand me? You were mugged."
273,JEFFREY:,Okay.
273,DEAN:,Okay.
273,JEFFREY:,"All right. Um, uh, thank you."
273,DEAN:,"""Classified server""? Got to be Devereaux, right?"
273,HALLUCIFER:,It's nice.
273,HALLUCIFER:,Kind of like a men's room with beds.
273,HALLUCIFER:,"Hmm, avocado grime."
273,HALLUCIFER:,Takes years to build up a patina like this.
273,SAM:,Frank's still stumped on Roman?
273,DEAN:,"Yeah. All right, let's do this."
273,SAM:,"Okay, um, look at the victim profiles."
273,SAM:,"Same age, same hair color, body type. The ritual mutilations line up exactly."
273,DEAN:,"Who down there would've let our demon out of the can? He squealed on his superiors. We made sure of that. I mean, he should be down under until, uh, trumpet day."
273,SAM:,"But two women killed in the last two weeks, same parts missing, I mean, same old hunting grounds, even."
273,DEAN:,"All right, well, we can take a swing at it. But you know it's all about the Leviathans now, okay? They're the ones we need to be hunting."
273,SAM:,"Yeah, but, no – I mean, not right now. This one's ours, Dean. It's unfinished business, apparently."
273,DEAN:,All right.
273,SAM:,Thanks.
273,DEAN:,"You know, every time we do this, I wonder if today's the day. We walk up, flash our tin to a bunch of chompers pretending to be policemen."
273,SAM:,I hear you.
273,DETECTIVE:,"Thought you guys might show up. It's the drummer boys: agents, uh, Bonham... and Watts, right?"
273,SAM:,Yeah.
273,DEAN:,"Yeah, absolutely."
273,SAM:,"Uh, it's a pleasure to see you again, Detective..."
273,HALLUCIFER:,Sutton.
273,SAM:,"You know what? Pardon me. Uh, what was it, Detective..."
273,HALLUCIFER:,[enunciating clearly] Sutton.
273,DETECTIVE:,"Oh, no problemo – Detective Sutton."
273,SAM:,Sutton.
273,DEAN:,"Sutton, yeah."
273,DEAN:,Hi.
273,DEAN:,Are you sure?
273,DEAN:,And no suspects?
273,DEAN:,"Thank you, Detective."
273,SAM:,Hey.
273,SAM:,Sulfur.
273,DEAN:,Damn it. Better go check on Havelock.
273,SAM:,Wiccansweb dot com.
273,SAM:,You sure about that?
273,SAM:,"Wow, uh, these are – these are good."
273,DEAN:,"Well, you helped track it down. I mean, it was some solid legwork."
273,SAM:,"Right, we, uh, we've had some technical difficulties – phone issues."
273,DEAN:,"It's a monster problem, really."
273,SAM:,"So, uh, you haven't had any contact?"
273,DEAN:,Good choice.
273,DEAN:,Who?
273,DEAN:,"Yeah, Jeffrey. That poor bastard."
273,SAM:,It's a start.
273,FACILITATOR:,"The halfway program advisers have already weighed in on that, Carl."
273,FACILITATOR:,Bringing it up in group is not going –
273,CARL:,[loudly] I said fine!
273,FACILITATOR:,"Jeffrey, you have something pretty big going down later this morning."
273,JEFFREY:,"That's right, I guess. Um, I'm picking her up today. I'm getting a dog – a rescue. I had to get her spayed and shots and stuff, but they said she's ready."
273,FACILITATOR:,"Jeffrey and I talked about this. He understands that pet ownership is a privilege, not a right. He's gonna have to show the whole house that he can handle the responsibility."
273,JEFFREY:,"And that's what it's all about, right, Alan? Handling it."
273,WOMAN:,Bye.
273,JEFFREY:,"You okay there? Huh? Surgery's a bucket of laughs, huh? You look good. I'm sorry for the cone of shame, but we got to keep these stitches in."
273,JEFFREY:,Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on.
273,SAM:,Jeffrey?
273,DEAN:,Jeffrey?
273,SAM:,"Okay. Look, it's okay. You're okay, you're okay."
273,DEAN:,Sorry. Just had to make sure.
273,JEFFREY:,Make sure of what – that I peed my pants today?
273,JEFFREY:,"Aw, you scared my dog."
273,SAM:,"Uh, we did not want to do that."
273,DEAN:,"Listen, Jeff, we got to, uh, we got to talk."
273,DEAN:,"Well, this is, uh..."
273,JEFFREY:,I know what it is.
273,SAM:,"Look, I know it must've been, um, hard."
273,HALLUCIFER:,Do you even listen to yourself?
273,HALLUCIFER:,"Oh, don't bother."
273,JEFFREY:,What do you guys want from me?
273,DEAN:,"Well, um, we're pretty sure the demon that possessed you... is back."
273,JEFFREY:,"What? What do you mean? You exorcised him, right? He's..."
273,JEFFREY:,...he's supposed to be in Hell.
273,SAM:,"Jeffrey, look, please just calm down. Just have a seat, please."
273,JEFFREY:,I don't understand.
273,DEAN:,Three more women have been murdered over the past two weeks.
273,JEFFREY:,"No, no."
273,DEAN:,"Same vic profiles, same forensics, crime scene dusted with sulfur. We've got to assume that it's him."
273,SAM:,"But we're here now, okay? So if he comes after you, we'll nail him just like we did last time."
273,JEFFREY:,What was her name?
273,DEAN:,What?
273,JEFFREY:,The last one he killed.
273,DEAN:,"Uh, Anna?"
273,SAM:,Anna Paxton.
273,JEFFREY:,Marjorie Willis. She's the next one on the list.
273,SAM:,List? What list?
273,JEFFREY:,"The demon used to recite it all the time, like a grocery list. He burned it in my head – the names of all the women he was gonna kill."
273,SAM:,He already had his victims chosen?
273,JEFFREY:,And put in a line in an order.
273,DEAN:,"Wait. Why? Demons aren't usually into the obsessive serial-killer crap. You know, they're more just kind of all-around evil. Why would he do this?"
273,JEFFREY:,He said it was his job.
273,ALAN:,"Jeffrey, did your, uh, guests sign in?"
273,JEFFREY:,"I'm really sorry, Alan. They're friends of mine from my days back at the Post Office. I didn't know they were coming."
273,SAM:,"So, what do you think?"
273,DEAN:,I think we really helped mess this poor son of a bitch up. Look at him. He's got a state-assigned dad.
273,ALAN:,"Okay, just get them to sign in when they sign out."
273,SAM:,"Uh, Jeffrey, look, I'm gonna go, uh, I'm gonna go find Marjorie Willis, keep her on watch, okay?"
273,DEAN:,Don't worry. I'm gonna stay here just in case.
273,WOMAN:,Excuse me.
273,HALLUCIFER:,You're right. We just don't read anymore.
273,HALLUCIFER:,"Marjorie Willis. Librarian, indoor gardening enthusiast, our demon's next organ donor."
273,HALLUCIFER:,"Come on, Sam, talk to me. It's been months."
273,JEFFREY:,"...I had three smashed fingers, five teeth out, a broken wrist, nose, cheekbone, collarbone. I had to get 160 stitches. [He exhales and smiles.] Mugged. The doctor on duty said it looked like I got caught in the Spanish Inquisition."
273,DEAN:,And we're the good guys.
273,JEFFREY:,"They patched me up, mostly. But I lost my job, my health insurance. I just started to drink and drift, and I got lost. Had some kind of mental break. And I started to talk... about what happened."
273,DEAN:,"Aw, man. Never tell. Never... never."
273,JEFFREY:,"I know that now, believe me."
273,DEAN:,"So, let me guess. Drunk tank to psych eval to 72-hour forced hold to a nice long stay at an institution of their choice."
273,JEFFREY:,Yes.
273,DEAN:,It's happened to friends of mine.
273,JEFFREY:,"For a long time, I didn't care. The truth was more important than where I was. I was in no shape to cope with the outside world."
273,DEAN:,"Well, hey, you got out, you know? Holding it together."
273,JEFFREY:,And now the demon is back.
273,DEAN:,"Yeah. I'm sorry, man. I mean it – about all of it, you know?"
273,JEFFREY:,You saved my life. I owe you for it. I know that. I owe a lot of people for getting even this far. I... crap.
273,DEAN:,What?
273,JEFFREY:,"If he isn't already circling the next woman, Marjorie, then I-I think I might know where he is. He had this special place where he kept souvenirs where he nested."
273,DEAN:,Why didn't you tell us this?
273,JEFFREY:,I didn't want to go.
273,DEAN:,You don't have to go. We'll handle it.
273,JEFFREY:,I do. I have to.
273,HALLUCIFER:,"""Average annual rainfall – Hackberry, Texas""..."
273,HALLUCIFER:,"Come on, Sam, pay attention to me. I'm bored."
273,HALLUCIFER:,Civil war buff?
273,DEAN:,Damn it – no service.
273,JEFFREY:,[to the dog in the back seat] Good girl. You stay. Here's some jerky. Stay.
273,DEAN:,"Thing's not gonna pee in here, is it?"
273,JEFFREY:,"Um, I don't know."
273,DEAN:,"So, he'd get you this far, and then he'd shut your lights out, yeah?"
273,JEFFREY:,"For some reason, he was very secretive about this place. But after a while, he'd only really sort of cover my eyes when we walked in."
273,DEAN:,"Okay, you think you can get us back there?"
273,JEFFREY:,Red door down the hallway.
273,DEAN:,"Yeah, there is."
273,JEFFREY:,This must be it.
273,DEAN:,"All right, stay over here. Okay? You just stay here. Don't move."
273,DEAN:,What the hell?
273,DEAN:,Hey.
273,DEAN:,"Hey. Hey, all right."
273,DEAN:,We're gonna get you out of here.
273,DEAN:,"Hey, hey, I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? But you got to stay still."
273,HALLUCIFER:,I'm pretty sure this guy's the boring sort of chubby chaser.
273,HALLUCIFER:,Not a good sign.
273,HALLUCIFER:,Hmm. Surprised you haven't picked up on that yet. It's right... there in the coroner's report.
273,HALLUCIFER:,"Yeah. Uh-huh. In this latest round of killings, our big girls had traces of heavy tranquilizers in their blood. Yeah? But our demon's strong enough to make fat Betty do whatever he wants to, right? So, why does he need the tranqs? Think he's got a bad back? Yeah, whatever is going on here, you know that demon's not coming back to kill anybody."
273,HALLUCIFER:,"Oh, no. That's every cellphone Dean's got. One of them should've picked up, right? Big brother's probably dead."
273,SAM:,Shut up.
273,HALLUCIFER:,"He said ""shut up"" to me."
273,HALLUCIFER:,"That's what I'm talking about, Sam – real interaction again. I miss that. The rapier wit, the wittier rape. Come on. I'll be good."
273,HALLUCIFER:,I'll even help you solve your little Nancy Drew mystery or whatever.
273,HALLUCIFER:,No note.
273,HALLUCIFER:,"Hmm, a cell phone scrambler. But, Luci, those are illegal. Think, Sam. Maybe this has something to do with Dean's telephone blackout."
273,HALLUCIFER:,Hmm. Latin – not suspicious at all.
273,HALLUCIFER:,No. But you've seen this type.
273,SAM:,A demon summoning – why?
273,HALLUCIFER:,"Why? To summon a demon, jackass. Start looking at who."
273,SAM:,"Okay, what do you mean?"
273,HALLUCIFER:,Look at the page.
273,HALLUCIFER:,You know this handwriting.
273,SAM:,I know this handwriting.
273,SAM:,"Nora, stop it! Calm down!"
273,SAM:,What is this? What is this? Why did Jeffrey have a demon summoning in your handwriting?
273,SAM:,What plan?!
273,HALLUCIFER:,Hit her.
273,SAM:,"Nora, tell me what is going on."
273,HALLUCIFER:,"Sam, shake her up. She knows what happened to Dean. Get this stupid cow to focus, will you?"
273,SAM:,"Nora, listen to me! Whatever it is, you should be a lot more scared of me right now because I'm two inches away from you, and I can make you talk. Do you understand me?"
273,SAM:,"What were you thinking? I mean, why would you even help bring back a demon in the first place?"
273,SAM:,Jeffrey?
273,DEAN:,Jeffrey?
273,JEFFREY:,Good. You're up.
273,DEAN:,What happened? What's going on?
273,JEFFREY:,"No one asked you to get involved, to save me, to save anyone."
273,DEAN:,What?
273,JEFFREY:,Did you ever think that maybe I loved being possessed?
273,JEFFREY:,"Did you? I loved the connection, the power. And I loved him. Love of my life, actually."
273,DEAN:,"Oh, you got to be kidding me."
273,JEFFREY:,He liberated me.
273,JEFFREY:,Started me on my true life mission.
273,DEAN:,"So you're the one with the thing for all those women. Aren't you, Jeffrey? You're a serial killer."
273,JEFFREY:,I was nothing before he found me – a shadow too scared to do what I was brought here to do. Too timid to live up to my true potential.
273,DEAN:,"So, what happened – redheaded mommy make you stuff birds, put on dresses?"
273,JEFFREY:,You shouldn't trivialize other people's pain.
273,DEAN:,"So, demon comes along, rides co-pilot in your skull... Teaches you how to kill. The list... that's yours."
273,JEFFREY:,"For years, it was just a game I would play. Every time I'd walk by one of them in the street or see one on my mail route... There's a sound that comes from their brains. You know that? Only I can hear it, like an evil, little steam whistle. Every time I saw one, I'd follow her, take down her address."
273,JEFFREY:,"But I was never gonna do anything, not till he came along. He's the one who saved me. And you sent him to Hell."
273,HALLUCIFER:,You really knocked the cork out of her piehole.
273,SAM:,Well... that demon gave up some serious state secrets – would've gone into big lockdown in Hell. Not so easy to bring him back up.
273,SAM:,Which was what?
273,SAM:,"""Blood of the exorcist""?"
273,SAM:,Yeah. Well... New plan.
273,SAM:,"Tracking spell – Bavarian, Egyptian. I don't care – dealer's choice. Use the flesh of the body to find the body and Dean. Do you want the ear or the kid?"
273,HALLUCIFER:,You're giving me the chills.
273,JEFFREY:,I like to think I know you pretty well.
273,DEAN:,"Yeah, how do you figure?"
273,JEFFREY:,"I watched you torture an innocent man to get out a demon. Pretty charged situation... revealing. You guys talked about a lot, showed a lot of character. God... you were so desperate to fix the world back then. It kills you..."
273,JEFFREY:,...that people keep getting hurt... and you just can't stop it. Or I should say...
273,JEFFREY:,"...it's killed you, shouldn't I?"
273,DEAN:,You know what? Screw you.
273,JEFFREY:,"Hey. I was there. I was depressed, Dean, because he was gone."
273,JEFFREY:,"I was a wreck, an emotional shell, a drunk. I was suicidal."
273,DEAN:,"I don't usually endorse suicide, but, man, what stopped you?"
273,JEFFREY:,It was Alan
273,JEFFREY:,At the house.
273,DEAN:,You're kidding me.
273,JEFFREY:,He's a really good rehab therapist. Really helped me focus on my goals...
273,JEFFREY:,"...my attitude. I have to say, I really benefited from the whole program."
273,DEAN:,Yeah.
273,JEFFREY:,A life well-lived comes from the structured pursuit of meaningful happiness.
273,JEFFREY:,I realized I was nothing without my demon. Then I decided I have to get him back. [pause] I'll be right back.
273,DEAN:,No.
273,DEAN:,"Oh, you sick son of a bitch."
273,DEMON:,"Hello, Jeffrey."
273,DEMON:,Dean Winchester. As I live and breathe...
273,DEMON:,Again.
273,JEFFREY:,Wh – wh–
273,JEFFREY:,Oh! What are you doing?
273,DEMON:,"I'm thanking you, Jeffrey."
273,JEFFREY:,What are you doing with this half-dead piece of crap? Come into me.
273,DEMON:,"We had a very special time together, didn't we, Jeffrey? It warms my heart to see you haven't forgotten what I taught you. You built on it."
273,DEMON:,"You captured a Winchester. You, Jeffrey... my pupil."
273,JEFFREY:,I don't want to be your pupil. I want to be yours.
273,DEMON:,"But I'm done with you. My work is finished. You can do everything now, all on your beautiful own."
273,JEFFREY:,No.
273,DEMON:,No?
273,DEMON:,"We don't do ""no."" Remember, Jeffrey?"
273,DEMON:,"Keep sawing away at your ropes, Penelope Pitstop. We can dance standing up if you want."
273,DEAN:,"So, is this what you do – find postal workers, make 'em go postal?"
273,DEMON:,"I talent scout. That's all. Looking for the next generation of superstars... Before they get to Hell, like Jeffrey here."
273,DEMON:,"He had all the raw material... just bubbling in there. All I had to do was loosen the lid on his jar, show him some practical know-how."
273,DEAN:,"Yeah, what about the kid?"
273,DEMON:,This one? I don't think. Not much to work with. No natural gift. I'll probably burn this meat off on my way to Vegas.
273,DEMON:,You've got to be kidding me!
273,DEMON:,Where do you keep coming from?
273,DEMON:,"[laughs] He'll be back, you know. Back in black."
273,DEAN:,Go to hell.
273,DEAN:,God. Oh.
273,SAM:,"So, Jeffrey was just pretending to be the victim. Way back in that farmhouse during the exorcism..."
273,SAM:,...h-he was just... acting.
273,DEAN:,"He was a psychopath, Sam. That's what they do all the time, is act. Act like they're normal, act like they're not balls-to-the-wall crazy."
273,SAM:,You going to sleep?
273,DEAN:,Damn straight. Screw consciousness – that's what I say.
273,HALLUCIFER:,"No, no, Sam. No nap for you, Sammy."
273,HALLUCIFER:,"Oh, come on, don't do that."
273,HALLUCIFER:,"Yeah, look at that. Something's definitely different now, isn't it? You let me in. You wanted me, partner. So you think you can use your little tricks to banish me again..."
273,HALLUCIFER:,"...like that? No. I do believe I've got you, bunk buddy."
273,HALLUCIFER:,Got my finger wiggling around in your brainpan.
273,HALLUCIFER:,"Come on, Sammy! Come on! Say it with me now. [shouts] Good morning, Vietnam!"
273,JEFFREY,(strained) I... I... need... some... help.
274,GEORGE,I won't be back till 9.
276,GIRL,Jenny Greentree. My dad says she really died in the woods. And she's buried in the town cemetery.
279,SAM,"Kevin, hey, hey, hey. Kevin."
