328,HARRY,"Oh. Hello, cute fuzzy animal watcher."
328,ED,I'm afraid it's time to put the puppies down.
328,HARRY,Time to quit petting your kittens—
328,HARRY,—and face the preternatural.
328,ED,Because guess what?
328,HARRY,You're in our world now.
328,ED,A world where your worst nightmare gets faced every single night.
328,HARRY,Or at least every single installment of the next ten episodes!
328,ED,Welcome to the world of—
328,HARRY,—the supernatural.
328,ED,"You know, we had absolute proof of a ghost haunting until our rivals got the drop on us."
328,HARRY,Our rivals who happen to be jealous douchenozzles.
328,ED,"But, you know, all's fair in love, war, whatever."
328,HARRY,We got bucked.
328,ED,"Bucked hard. Mm-hm. We got back on, we let that horse know who's bucking who."
328,HARRY,We're some pretty badass broncos.
328,ED,"No, I—we'd be—we'd be the cowboys."
328,ED,"Bronco, ride the horse, yeehah."
328,HARRY,Oh.
328,HARRY,"So far no luck getting another specter on film. Uh, uh—"
328,ED,"We're not worried. 'Cause if it's out there, we're gonna find it. We're coming for ya."
328,HARRY,"If you're dead, you'd better stay dead."
328,ED,Yup.
328,HARRY,"'Cause if not, we're gonna kill you."
328,MAGGIE,"Hey Spruce, did you see this? It just came in yesterday."
328,MAGGIE,It's a camera with a thermal imaging mode.
328,SPRUCE,Holla.
328,DAVE,I don't know where to start. I studied mysticism for four years at UC Berkeley and I heard about Ed and Harry there.
328,ED,"Yeah, uh, Dave, Dave, Dave. Good intern, uh, knows his equipment, runs a mean cable—"
328,HARRY,Knows his Trek.
328,ED,Yeah. He's no Corbett.
328,HARRY,He's alive.
328,ED,Coffee break.
328,ED,"I just, uh, I need a moment."
328,HARRY,Corbett was our last intern. He died in the line of duty.
328,HARRY,He's been practicing his ghost martial arts a lot.
328,MAGGIE,Hey guys. Just got a hit on the Ghostfacers website.
328,MAGGIE,Five separate confirmed ghost sightings—
328,MAGGIE,—at a rundown theater in Hollywood called the Grand Showcase.
328,ED,Confirmed?
328,MAGGIE,Yeah. Three people have been physically attacked.
328,ED,"Thank you, adopted sister, sounds like we've got our next mission."
328,ED,"That means full investigation deployment, all right?"
328,ED,I want a map of the area right around here—
328,WOMAN,Hi.
328,WOMAN,Excuse me.
328,WOMAN,I saw the ad. Is the intern position still open?
328,WOMAN,"Oh, my god, camera."
328,WOMAN,Hi.
328,ED,What's your name?
328,WOMAN,"Oh, Amber, with a Y."
328,HARRY,You're hired.
328,AMBYR,Really?
328,ED,Dave?
328,HARRY,You're fired.
328,ED,View the case. The Grand Showcase Theater.
328,ED,"Built in 1939. Home to numerous ghost sightings and attacks. Maggie, got some info for us?"
328,MAGGIE,Yeah. Um. Janet Myers.
328,MAGGIE,She was an aspiring actress. She was attending a swanky party at the theater when her ex-husband just followed her into a dressing room and killed her.
328,HARRY,Carved her face up with a razor.
328,HARRY,Made her watch the whole thing.
328,SPRUCE,Crime of passion.
328,HARRY,Mm-hm. Repeated spectral violence eventually shut the place down.
328,ED,Let's take a look.
328,AMBYR,Wait. But what if it's haunted?
328,MAGGIE,Ambyr.
328,ED,Really good intern!
328,HARRY,Great intern!
328,MAGGIE,Hey—
328,MAGGIE,Oh.
328,MAGGIE,"Me and Harry? Well, we're, uh, no, noth–ab—"
328,MAGGIE,"There, there was something that happened during our last mission."
328,MAGGIE,"And, you know, he is my brother's best friend, so that's bad for the team."
328,HARRY,We felt for the good of the team that it was just better this way.
328,MAGGIE,Why? What'd he say?
328,HARRY,That what she said?
328,ED,"All right, team, we got two hours to sundown. I want all gear and personnel ready to deploy by seventeen hundred. Let's move out."
328,ED,Are you kidding me?
328,AMBYR,What?
328,ED,"Harry, you park here? Daylight parking is a fifty-dollar ticket!"
328,HARRY,Wasn't me.
328,ED,Who parked here?
328,AMBYR,Um. Ah.
