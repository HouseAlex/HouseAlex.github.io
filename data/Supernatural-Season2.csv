155,NURSE,You'll need to undress.
155,DEAN,No. It would be wrong to go in. Would it?
155,DEAN,You can see me?
155,WOMAN,"I prefer Alex Trebek with the mustache, don't you?"
155,DEAN,Now what?
156,DAD,"Who the hell are you? 
Get out! Get out of my house!"
156,SAM,Hey!
156,DEAN,Hey.
156,DEAN,Do you mind...
157,SAM,"So someone's already here, killing vampires, huh?"
157,DEAN,"Well, whatever it is, it doesn't matter. You've still gotta smoke the nest, whether we find our mystery guest or not."
157,SAM,I suppose.
157,DEAN,Any luck with that address with Christine Flanagan?
157,SAM,"Nah, just a PO Box.  And guess what?"
157,DEAN,Hmm?
157,SAM,Same with the first victim.
157,DEAN,"(laughs.) Heh heh heh heh. Victim. that's, that's that's, funny."
157,SAM,"You know what, Dean, they both got hired six months ago."
157,DEAN,Yeah.
157,SAM,"Six months.  I mean, doesn't that seem long to you?  Weren't the last vampires we tangled with migratory?"
157,DEAN,"Well, if you think about it, I mean, they could get a job, they could blend in, you know.  nobody's gonna suspect the cute waitress at the diner, right?  So. They get enough people, they bleed 'em in the nest, it's an all-you-can-eat buffet."
157,SAM,"Yeah, okay.  But ... the missing persons stats around here are average. Hell, they're actually below average."
157,DEAN,"Well, maybe they're grabbing their takeout from someplace else.  I don't really care.  All I know is I get to kill some vampires."
157,DEAN,What?
157,SAM,"Look, don't get me wrong, all right?  I'm happy you're happy.  But don't you think that, with everything that happened to Dad, you're just acting a little too caffeinated?"
157,DEAN,"I'm enjoying my work, Sammy.  You oughta try it sometime."
158,LINDSEY,She was great.
158,DEAN,Hmm.
158,NEIL,"Well, she really loved that guy. But the night of the accident she walked in on him with another girl."
158,DEAN,Hmm.
159,LATER,
160,KATIE,"I checked the fuses. They're fine. It's the wiring. Look, you promised the place would be ready when I moved in. No. You come up now! Please. Thank you."
160,KATIE,Gross.
160,KATIE,What the hell?
160,DEAN,"Los Angeles, California."
160,SAM,What's in L.A.?
160,DEAN,Young girl's been kidnapped by an evil cult.
160,SAM,Yeah? Girl got a name?
160,DEAN,Katie Holmes.
160,DEAN,"Of course, on the other hand — catfight."
160,ELLEN,"I am your mother, I don't have to be reasonable!"
160,JO,You can't keep me here!
160,ELLEN,"Oh, don't you bet on that, sweetie."
160,JO,"What are you going to do, are you going to chain me up in the basement?"
160,ELLEN,"You know what, you've had worse ideas than that recently. Hey, you don't wanna stay, don't stay. Go back to school."
160,JO,I didn't belong there! I was a freak with a knife collection.
160,SAM,"Yes, ma'am."
160,DEAN,"Yeah, we rarely drink before ten anyway."
160,JO.,Wait. I wanna know what they think about this.
160,ELLEN,I don't care what they think!
160,DAD,Are you guys open?
160,ELLEN,Yes!
160,DAD,We'll just... check out the Arby's down the road.
160,ELLEN,"Harvelle's.  Yeah, Preacher."
160,DEAN,"No, but your mom might."
160,JO,"And this girl wasn't the first. Over the past eighty years six women have vanished. All from the same building, all young blondes. Only happens every decade or two so cops never eyeball the pattern. So we're either dealing with one very old serial killer, or —"
160,DEAN,Who put this together? Ash?
160,JO,I did it myself.
160,SAM,I gotta admit. We hit the road for a lot less.
160,ELLEN,"Good. You like the case so much, you take it."
160,JO,Mom!
160,ELLEN,"Joanna Beth, this family has lost enough. And I won't lose you too. I just won't."
160,SAM,"I feel kind of bad, snaking Jo's case."
160,SAM,"No, not yet."
160,SAM,What's that?
160,DEAN,What?
160,DEAN,"All right, let's find this badass before he snags any more girls."
160,JO,It's so convenient.
160,LANDLORD,"Yeah, it's a great building, fixed it up real nice. All the apartments come furnished, too."
160,JO,"It is so spacious. You know, my friend told me I absolutely have to come check it out, and I have to admit, she was right. You did a really good job with this place."
160,LANDLORD,Good to meetcha.  Quite a gal you've got here.
160,JO,"So, did you already check out that apartment? The one for rent."
160,DEAN,Yeah. Yes. Loved it.  Heh. Great flow.
160,LANDLORD,How'd you get in?
160,DEAN,It was open.
160,JO,"Now, Ed, um, when did the last tenant move out?"
160,LANDLORD,"Oh, about a month ago. Cut and run, too. Stick me for the rent."
160,JO,"Well. Her loss, our gain!  'Cause if Dean-o loves it, it's good enough for me."
160,JO,I'll flip you for the sofa.
160,DEAN,Does your mother even know you're here?
160,JO,Told her I was going to Vegas.
160,DEAN,You think she's gonna buy that?
160,JO,I'm not an idiot. I got Ash to lay a credit card trail all the way to the casinos.
160,DEAN,"You know, you shouldn't lie to your mom. Shouldn't be here either."
160,JO,"Well, I am. So untwist your boxers and deal with it."
160,SAM,"Where'd you get all that money from, anyways?"
160,JO,"Working, at the Roadhouse."
160,DEAN,Hunters don't tip that well.
160,JO,"Well, they aren't that good at poker, either."
160,DEAN,Yeah.
160,DEAN,"Oh, hi Ellen."
160,ELLEN,She left a note she's in Vegas. I don't believe it for a second.
160,DEAN,I haven't seen her.
160,DEAN,"Yeah, I'm sure."
160,ELLEN,"Well, please. If she shows up, you'll drag her butt right back here, won't you?"
160,DEAN,Absolutely.
160,ELLEN,"Okay. Thanks, honey."
160,JO,"This place was built in 1924. It was originally a warehouse, converted into apartments a few months ago."
160,DEAN,Yeah? What was here before 1924.
160,JO,Nothing. Empty field.
160,SAM,"So, most likely scenario, someone died bloody in the building, and now he's back and raising hell."
160,JO,"Obituaries, mortuary reports and seven other sources. I know what I'm doing."
160,DEAN,I think the jury's still out on that one. Could you put the knife down?
160,SAM,"Okay!  So, uh, it's something else, then. Maybe some kind of cursed object that brought a spirit with it."
160,JO,"Well, we've got to scan the whole building. Everywhere we can get to, right?"
160,DEAN,"Right. So. You and me, we'll take the top two floors."
160,JO,We'd move faster if we split up.
160,DEAN,"Oh, this isn't negotiable."
160,JO,So. You gonna buy me dinner?
160,DEAN,What are you talking about?
160,JO,It's just if you're gonna ride me this close it's only decent you buy me dinner.
160,DEAN,"Oh, that's hilarious.  You know, it's bad enough I lied to your mom, but if you think I'm letting you out of my sight... I don't know if you've noticed, but you're kind of the spirit's type."
160,JO,Exactly.
160,DEAN,You wanna be bait?
160,JO,Quickest way to draw it out and you know it.
160,DEAN,Oh.
160,JO,What?
160,DEAN,I'm so regretting this.
160,JO,"You know, I've had it up to here with your crap."
160,DEAN,Excuse me?
160,JO,Your chauvinist crap. You think women can't do the job.
160,DEAN,"Sweetheart, this ain't gender studies. Women can do the job fine. Amateurs can't. You have no experience. What you do have is a bunch of half-baked romantic notions that some barflies put in your head."
160,JO,Now you sound like my mother.
160,DEAN,"Oh, and that's a bad thing? Because let me tell you..."
160,JO,What?
160,DEAN,Forget it.
160,JO,"No, you started this."
160,DEAN,"Jo, you've got options. No one in their right mind chooses this life. My dad started me in this when I was so young... I wish I could do something else."
160,JO,You love the job.
160,DEAN,"Yeah, but I'm a little twisted."
160,JO,You don't think I'm a little twisted too?
160,DEAN,"Jo, you've got a mother that worries about you. Who wants something more for you. Those are good things. You don't throw things like that away. Might be hard to find later."
160,DEAN,What?
160,JO,I'm not sure.
160,DEAN,You smell that?
160,DEAN,No. Something else. I know it. I just can't put my finger on it.
160,DEAN,Mazel Tov. You just found your first spirit.
160,JO,It's inside the vent.
160,DEAN,Here.
160,DEAN,There's something in there. Here.
160,DEAN,Somebody's keeping souvenirs.
160,TERESA,"This building, I swear to God..."
160,TERESA,"Screw it, I'm out of here."
160,JO,"Morning, princess."
160,DEAN,Where's Sam?
160,JO,Went to get coffee.
160,DEAN,Ugh. My back. How'd you sleep on that big soft bed?
160,JO,I didn't. Just been going over everything.
160,DEAN,Here.
160,JO,What's this for?
160,DEAN,Work a hell of a lot better than that little pig-sticker you're twirling around.
160,JO,William Anthony Harvelle.
160,DEAN,I'm sorry. My mistake.
160,JO,He must have been proud.
160,DEAN,What about your dad?
160,JO,"I was still in pigtails when my dad died, but I remember him coming home from a hunt. He'd burst through that door like, like Steve McQueen or something. And he'd sweep me up in his arms, and I'd breathe in that old leather jacket of his. And my mom, who was sour and pissed from the minute he left, she started smiling again. And we were... we were a family. You wanna know why I want to do the job? For him. It's my way of being close to him. Now tell me what's wrong with that."
160,DEAN,Nothing.
160,DEAN,Where's the coffee?
160,SAM,There are cops outside. Another girl disappeared.
160,DEAN,"Teresa Ellis, Apartment 2F. Boyfriend reported her missing around dawn."
160,JO,And her apartment?
160,DEAN,"Cracks all over the plaster, walls, ceiling. There was ectoplasm, too."
160,SAM,"Well, between that and that tuft of hair I'd say this sucker's coming from the walls."
160,DEAN,But who is it? Building's history is totally clean.
160,DEAN,What do you mean?
160,JO,Check this out.
160,JO,It's where this building was built. Take a look at the one next door. The windows.
160,SAM,Bars.
160,DEAN,We're next door to a prison?
160,SAM,"Well, then, we need a list. All the people executed there."
160,JO,Ash is already on it.
160,SAM,A hundred fifty seven names?
160,DEAN,We've gotta narrow that down.
160,SAM,Yeah.
160,DEAN,Or else we're gonna be digging up a hell of a lot of stiffs.
160,SAM,Herman Webster Mudgett?
160,JO,Yeah?
160,SAM,Wasn't that H. H. Holmes' real name?
160,DEAN,You've gotta be kiddin' me.
160,DEAN,"Yep. Holmes was executed at Moyamensing, May 7, 1896."
160,SAM,"H. H. Holmes himself. Come on, I mean, what are the odds?"
160,JO,Who is this guy?
160,DEAN,"The term ""multi-murderer."" They coined it to describe Holmes. He was America's first serial killer, before anybody knew what a serial killer was."
160,SAM,"Yeah, he confessed to twenty seven murders, but some put the death toll at over a hundred."
160,JO,"Well, we just find the bones, salt 'em and burn 'em, right?"
160,SAM,"Well, it's not that easy. His body is buried in town, but it's encased in a couple tons of concrete."
160,JO,What? Why?
160,DEAN,"The story goes that he didn't want anybody mutilating his corpse. 'Cause, you know, that's what he used to do."
160,SAM,You know somethin'. We might have an even bigger problem than that.
160,JO,How does this get bigger?
160,SAM,"Holmes built an apartment building in Chicago. He called it the Murder Castle. The whole place was a death factory, they had, uh, trap doors, acid vats, quick line pits... he built these secret chambers inside the walls. He'd lock his victims in, keep them alive for days. Some he'd suffocate, others he'd let starve to death."
160,JO,So Teresa could still be alive. She could be inside these walls.
160,DEAN,"We need sledgehammers, crowbars. We've got to smash these walls, anywhere thick enough to hide a girl."
160,DEAN,It's too narrow. Can't go any further.
160,JO,Let me see.
160,JO,What?
160,DEAN,"I, uh, I wish the pipes were cleaner."
160,JO,Shut up. I can fit in there.
160,DEAN,You're not going in there by yourself.
160,JO,You got a better idea?
160,DEAN,You-
160,JO,Uh-huh.
160,DEAN,Where are you?
160,JO,On the north wall.
160,JO,I'm heading down some kind of air duct.
160,DEAN,"No, no, no, no, stay up here."
160,JO,"Look, we've gotta find this girl, don't we? I'm okay."
160,JO,Oh god.
160,DEAN,Jo!
160,SAM,Whoa.
160,DEAN,He's got Jo.
160,SAM,What? How'd that happen?
160,DEAN,I wasn't with her; I left her alone. Dammit!
160,SAM,"Hey, hey, look, we'll find her, all right?"
160,DEAN,Where?
160,SAM,Inside the walls.
160,DEAN,"We've been inside the walls all night. None of the other girls were there, she won't be either."
160,SAM,Look. We've just gotta take a beat and think about this. Maybe we got Holmes' M.O. wrong.
160,DEAN,"Yeah, well, we'd better friggin' think fast."
160,DEAN,Yeah.
160,DEAN,Ellen.
160,ELLEN,"No - Ash told me everything. Man's a genius, but he folds like a cheap suit. Now you put my damn daughter on the phone."
160,DEAN,"She's gonna have to call you back, she's taking care of, uh, feminine business."
160,ELLEN,"Yeah, right. Where is she? Where is she?!"
160,DEAN,"Look, we'll get her back."
160,ELLEN,Get her back? Back from what?
160,DEAN,"The spirit we're hunting, it took her."
160,ELLEN,Oh my god.
160,DEAN,"She'll be okay, I promise."
160,ELLEN,You promise. That is not the first time I've heard that from a Winchester.
160,DEAN,What?
160,ELLEN,If anything happens to her...
160,DEAN,"It won't. I won't let it.  Ellen, I'm sorry, I really am."
160,ELLEN,I'm taking the first flight out. I'll be there in a few hours.
160,DEAN,Damnit!
160,SAM,"Don't beat yourself up, Dean. There's nothing you could have done."
160,DEAN,Tell me you've got something.
160,SAM,"Uh, maybe. Look. You look at the layout of the Holmes murder castle, there's all the torture chambers inside the walls, right?"
160,DEAN,Right.
160,SAM,But there's one we haven't considered yet. The one in this basement.
160,DEAN,This building doesn't have a basement.
160,SAM,"You're right, it doesn't. But I just noticed this. Beneath the foundation, it looks like part of an old sewer system that hasn't been used for —"
160,DEAN,Let's go.
160,JO,Hello?
160,JO,Your name's Teresa?
160,TERESA,Yes.
160,JO,"This won't make you feel better, but I'm here to rescue you."
160,TERESA,"Oh god. He's out there, he's gonna kill us!"
160,JO,"No, he won't. We're getting out. My friends are looking for us, they'll find us."
160,TERESA,"Oh god, he's here!"
160,JO,Shh! Just be quiet!
160,SAM,Here.
160,HOLMES,You're so pretty. So beautiful.
160,JO,Go to hell!
160,JO,"How do you like that? Pure iron, you creepy-ass son of a bitch!"
160,TERESA,Is he gone?
160,JO,I don't know. I...
160,HOLMES,Shhh.
160,DEAN,Hey!
160,DEAN,Jo?!
160,JO,I'm here!
160,SAM,"We're gonna get you out of here, all right?"
160,JO,Been better. Let's get the hell out of here before he comes back.
160,DEAN,"Actually, I don't think you're leaving here just yet."
160,JO,What?
160,DEAN,Remember when I said you being bait was a bad plan? Now it's kind of the only one we got.
160,DEAN,Now!
160,JO,"Scream all you want, you dick, but there's no way you're stepping over that salt!"
160,SAM,So? This job as glamorous as you thought it would be?
160,JO,"Well, except for all the pee-your-pants terror, yeah. Sure. But that Teresa girl's gonna live a life because of us. It's worth it, isn't it?"
160,SAM,Yeah. Yeah it is.
160,JO,"Hey, what if somebody finds that sewer down there, or a storm washes the salt away?"
160,SAM,Both very fine points. Which is why we're waiting here.
160,JO,For what?
160,JO,You ripped off a cement truck?
160,DEAN,"Boy, you, you really weren't kidding about flying out, were you?"
160,DEAN,How about we listen to some music?
160,SONG,You're as cold as ice...
160,DEAN,This is gonna be a long drive.
160,DEAN,"Ellen? This is my fault. Okay? I lied to you and I'm sorry. But Jo did good out there, I think her dad would be proud."
160,ELLEN,Don't you dare say that. Not you. I need a moment with my daughter. Alone.
160,JO,You're angry. I understand.
160,ELLEN,Angry? Angry doesn't begin to touch it.
160,JO,"Let's just think about this. Everything's okay, I'm alive..."
160,ELLEN,Not after I'm through with you.
160,JO,"Is this about me hunting, or something else?"
160,ELLEN,You let those boys use you as bait!
160,JO,"They were right there, backing me up the whole time."
160,ELLEN,"That is why you do not have the sense to do this job, you're trusting your life to them."
160,JO,What are you talking about?
160,ELLEN,"Like father, like sons, that is what I'm talking about."
160,JO,John? I thought you and John were friends.
160,ELLEN,"Yeah, we were, I'm sorry, I didn't mean..."
160,JO,Mom? What aren't you telling me?
160,DEAN,"That bad, huh?"
160,JO,Not right now.
160,DEAN,"What happened? Hey, talk to me."
160,JO,Get off me!
160,DEAN,Sorry. See you around.
160,JO,"Dean. It turns out my dad had a partner on his last hunt. Funny, he usually worked alone; this guy did too, but... I guess my father figured he could trust him. Mistake. Guy screwed up, got my dad killed."
160,DEAN,What does this have to do with—
160,JO,"It was your father, Dean."
160,DEAN,What?
160,JO,"Why do you think John never came back? Never told you about us? Because he couldn't look my mom in the eye after that, that's why."
160,DEAN,Jo.
160,JO,"Just... just get out of here.  Please, just leave."
162,SAM,What?
166,GUARD,Thank you.  Thank you.
166,SAM,Sure.
166,GUARD,... Thank you.
166,DEAN,Yeah?
173,RANDALL:,Hey!
173,RANDALL:,Guard! Hey!
173,RANDALL:,"Come on, damn it! Hey! Guard! Come here! Hey!"
173,GUARD:,Going down to B-Block. Randall again…
173,RANDALL:,Hey!
173,RANDALL:,"Guard, hey!"
173,RANDALL:,"You telling me you didn’t see that? What, are you blind? Hey!"
173,GUARD:,"Randall, cool it."
173,RANDALL:,"Cool it my ass, man – there’s somebody out there."
173,GUARD:,"Randall, turn out your light and go to sleep. I’m not going to say it again."
173,GUARD:,"Lights out, B-Block."
173,GUARD:,No…no…No! No! Nooo! No! No! Nooo! Aah! Nooooo!
173,DEAN:,This way.
173,SAM:,"I hate this plan, Dean."
173,DEAN:,"Yeah, I got that the first ten times I heard it."
173,PHOTOGRAPHER:,Front.
173,PHOTOGRAPHER:,To the right.
173,DEAN:,I call this one the Blue Steel.
173,PHOTOGRAPHER:,"Yeah, that’s right."
173,PHOTOGRAPHER:,To the right.
173,PHOTOGRAPHER:,"All right, back to the lineup."
173,DEAN:,"Wait, who looks better, me or Nick Nolte?"
173,PHOTOGRAPHER:,Shut up.
173,DEAN:,"Well, it’s about time. I’ll have a cheeseburger. Extra onions."
173,HENRIKSEN:,You think you’re funny.
173,DEAN:,I think I’m adorable.
173,HENRIKSEN:,"It is a pleasure to finally meet you in person, Dean. (On hearing this, Dean's smile freezes.) I’m Special Agent Victor Henriksen. This is my partner, Special Agent Reidy."
173,DEAN:,"[still smiling, but looking a bit worried] Henriksen? Not the Milwaukee agent Henriksen?"
173,HENRIKSEN:,Live and in person.
173,HENRIKSEN:,"Oh, nice shot. [He tosses the picture onto the table.] You can hang that up in your cell at Super Max."
173,DEAN:,"All right, maybe we can just forget the cheeseburger, huh?"
173,HENRIKSEN:,"Oh, yeah. Keep that game face on. Try and cover how up cornered you are. [to REIDY] Read him the charges."
173,REIDY:,"Well, we got mail fraud, credit card fraud, grave desecration..."
173,HENRIKSEN:,Skip to the good ones.
173,REIDY:,"Armed robbery, kidnapping and, oh, three counts of first-degree murder."
173,HENRIKSEN:,"And after Milwaukee your brother is now a suspect in a murder case himself. I’d say for you two, ""screwed to hell"" is a major understatement."
173,DEAN:,"Well, where there’s life there’s hope, huh?"
173,HENRIKSEN:,"[Makes a noise of assent] See? That’s what I kept thinking as I was searching for your asses all over hell and gone. [He leans forward on the table, speaking softly.] Your dad taught you well. The way you cover your tracks and after Milwaukee the way you [He whistles and moves his hand to the side, mimicking disappearing] vanished. [DEAN laughs softly.] Near went nuts trying to find you. Ask him."
173,REIDY:,[Deadpans] He near went nuts.
173,HENRIKSEN:,"And after all of that, you get tripped up on a motion detector. Pretty rookie move. Gotta say I was… surprised."
173,DEAN:,In the flesh.
173,HENRIKSEN:,And you are?
173,DEAN:,Huh.
173,HENRIKSEN:,"Yeah, and we’re not quite done here."
173,DEAN:,And they’ll keep us in the county jail?
173,SAM:,Green River County Detention Center?
173,DEAN:,"Yeah, we figured that."
173,SAM:,How long can we stall extradition?
173,PRISONER:,"You’re mine, baby!"
173,DEAN:,"Don’t worry, Sam. I promise I won’t trade you for smokes."
173,DEAN:,I call top bunk!
173,DEAN:,Okay.
173,DEAN:,"[in a low voice to SAM, who is standing behind him] My roommate doesn't say much – how's yours?"
173,SAM:,[quietly] Just keeps staring at me... in a way that makes me ... really uneasy.
173,DEAN:,It sounds like you're making new friends.
173,SAM:,"Dean. This is, without a doubt, the dumbest, craziest thing we've ever done. And that's in a long, storied career of dumb and crazy."
173,DEAN:,Calm down. It's all part of the plan.
173,SAM:,Oh really? So Henriksen showing up was part of the plan?
173,DEAN:,"Yeah, that guy moves a little faster than I thought. Look, all we gotta do is find this ghost, put the sucker down... then grab ourselves a couple of teardrop tattoos."
173,SAM:,"That's not funny. Dean, what about this escape plan? It –"
173,DEAN:,"It's 100 percent sure. I wouldn't have gone if it wasn't. I mean, come on, man, this place has all the signs of a haunting. Innocent people are dead. Four so far."
173,SAM:,"[laughs sarcastically] Yeah, innocent."
173,DEAN:,"You from Texas all of a sudden? Just because these people are in jail, doesn't mean they deserve to die. If we don't stop this thing, people are going to continue to die. We do this job wherever it takes us."
173,SAM:,"Look, Dean, just be straight with me, all right? You're doing this for Deacon."
173,DEAN:,Damn right.
173,SAM:,"Well, you barely even know the guy."
173,DEAN:,We know he was in the Corps with Dad. We know he saved Dad's life. We know we owe him.
173,SAM:,But don't you think he's asking a little much?
173,DEAN:,"It doesn't matter. We may not be saints, but we're loyal and we pay our debts. Now, that means something to me, and it ought to you. I'm not thrilled about this either, man, but Deacon asked us to hunt this thing down, and that's exactly what we're going to do."
173,DEAN:,"You know, this chicken isn't half bad."
173,SAM:,Great.
173,SAM:,"Finish mine. All right, so let's go back over this, Dean."
173,SAM:,"Spirit suspect number one is Mark Moody, right?"
173,DEAN:,"Yeah, psycho killer extraordinaire – Satanism, ritual murderer, died in jail."
173,SAM:,You sure it's him?
173,DEAN:,Pretty sure.
173,SAM:,"Dean, considering our circumstances, I'm gonna need a little bit better than ""pretty sure."""
173,DEAN:,"Really pretty sure. Moody died of a heart attack, which is what all the victims in here are dying of. He died in the old cell block, which they closed after he croaked, 30 years ago. They just opened that back up. That's when the killings started."
173,SAM:,So you think his spirit was released somehow?
173,DEAN:,Mm-hmm.
173,SAM:,But what if he was already cremated?
173,DEAN:,"I'm guessing there's something in the old block that's keeping him around. And whatever it is, we got to find it. And, uh, you know the rest. [DEAN puts down his fork.] I'm done."
173,SAM:,Sorry. I –
173,SAM:,Yeah. Sure. I just –
173,DEAN:,He said he was sorry.
173,SAM:,Dean...
173,DEAN:,"Great, another guy who's seen ""Taxi Driver"" too many times. Yeah, I'm talking to you. Trust me. Let it go."
173,SAM:,"Dean, come on."
173,DEAN:,"See, that's how you got to talk to these guys. [DEAN winks.] Instant respect."
173,SAM:,You were saying?
173,DEAN:,"Oh, great."
173,DEAN:,"We can end this right now – no harm, no foul."
173,WARDEN:,That's enough!
173,WARDEN:,"On your feet, Lucas."
173,LUCAS:,"Yes, sir, boss."
173,WARDEN:,What's your name?
173,DEAN:,Winchester.
173,WARDEN:,"Well, Winchester ... not a good start. (Long pause.) Solitary. You too, Lucas."
173,LUCAS:,"Yes, sir."
173,DEAN:,"[to Sam, over the shoulder of the guard holding him and escorting him out] Are we having fun yet, huh?"
173,DEAN:,I wish I had a baseball.
173,LUCAS:,What? What'd you say?
173,DEAN:,"I said, ""I wish I had a baseball."""
173,DEAN:,"You know, like ... Steve McQueen."
173,LUCAS:,"Yeah? Well, I wish I had a bat -- so I could bash your frickin’ head in."
173,DEAN:,Okay.
173,DEAN:,"Well, so much for the bonding in solitary moment."
173,DEAN:,"Oh, crap."
173,DEAN:,"Lucas, listen to me.  Stay very still."
173,HENRIKSEN:,"Hey, Daniels."
173,HENRIKSEN:,Have a seat. What's on your mind?
173,HENRIKSEN:,Welcome to my world.
173,HENRIKSEN:,Saved her from what?
173,HENRIKSEN:,"That's because she's nuts. Look, I was in Milwaukee. I spoke to her, I spoke to all the witnesses."
173,HENRIKSEN:,"And, all I know is, wherever these guys go, people die. It's that simple."
173,HENRIKSEN:,Like what?
173,HENRIKSEN:,"Strange.  Yeah.  Okay.  Grownups are trying to get some work done here, so... if you don't mind..."
173,SAM:,How you doing?
173,PRISONER:,"I'm 54 years old, mopping the floor of a crapper with bars on the windows. How you think I'm doing?"
173,SAM:,All right. Bad icebreaker. I'm Sam.
173,PRISONER:,Randall.
173,SAM:,"Nice to meet y–  Randall.  Hey, weren't you there the night that guard died?"
173,RANDALL:,Yeah.
173,SAM:,"Well, what happened?"
173,RANDALL:,They say the stress of the job got him.
173,SAM:,Yeah? What do you say?
173,RANDALL:,"Why are you inside, kid?"
173,SAM:,'Cause I got an idiot for a brother.
173,RANDALL:,That'll do it.
173,SAM:,Yeah.
173,RANDALL:,"Well, this place ain't so bad. Compared to the old cellblock, this is the damn Hilton."
173,SAM:,You spent time in the old block?
173,RANDALL:,"Oh, yeah, I was a regular customer."
173,SAM:,Didn't they have Mark Moody over there for a while?
173,RANDALL:,"He was there. Yeah I was there, too, the night that lunatic bought it."
173,SAM:,"Yeah? It was a heart attack, right?"
173,RANDALL:,"Sure, his heart stopped right after the guard stopped using his head for batting practice. The next morning, I was in his cell, mopping up the blood. What a mess."
173,SAM:,Wait. So he – he was beaten and – and nobody reported it?
173,RANDALL:,"You kept your mouth shut, unless you wanted to die from the same heart attack, you know?"
173,SAM:,"Randall, exactly how much blood was there?"
173,DEAN:,Call.
173,DEAN:,That's a bad beat. That is a bad beat...
173,DEAN:,"...but, see, I'm full... 3s over aces."
173,DEAN:,"[laughs and spreads his hands] Ha ha ha, sorry. Hey, it's a cruel game, my friend."
173,DEAN:,"Sorry, guys."
173,DEAN:,It's like picking low hanging fruit.
173,SAM:,You don't even smoke.
173,DEAN:,Are you kidding me? This is the currency of the realm.
173,DEAN:,Me too. His spirit paid a little visit last night.
173,SAM:,What?
173,DEAN:,"The clock stopped, the flickering lights, cold spot... I mean, he did everything but yell boo."
173,SAM:,"Well, what happened?"
173,DEAN:,"He walked right by me. Lucas wasn't so lucky. I mean, the way he was screaming... The guy was a jerk, but he didn't deserve to go like that. What'd you find out on Moody?"
173,SAM:,"Yeah, so, I think I know where we might find his remains. Blood in his old cell."
173,DEAN:,Blood? I thought it was a heart attack.
173,SAM:,"It was, after the guards worked him over. I mean, apparently there was so much blood in there, they had trouble mopping it out."
173,DEAN:,How we gonna get in?
173,SAM:,I got a plan.
173,DEAN:,"[smiling] That's the Sammy I know. Come on, man, you're like Clint Eastwood from ""Escape From Alcatraz."""
173,SAM:,"The problem is, if even if we do find something, how are we gonna burn it? We don't have any accelerant."
173,DEAN:,"It’s a good thing I'm like James Garner from ""The Great Escape."""
173,DEAN:,"Hey, fellas! Who's ready to deal?"
173,DEAN:,You sure about this?
173,SAM:,Pretty sure.
173,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, considering our circumstances, I'd like a little better than ""pretty sure."""
173,SAM:,"Okay, really pretty sure."
173,DEAN:,I'd like mine al dente.
173,DEAN:,Perfect.
173,DEAN:,"Save room for dessert, Tiny. Heh heh heh."
173,DEAN:,"Hey, I wanted to ask you, 'cause I couldn't help but notice that you are two tons of fun. Just curious – is it like a thyroid problem, or is it some deep seated self-esteem issue?"
173,DEAN:,"'Cause, you know, they're, uh they're just doughnuts. They're not love."
173,WARDEN:,"Guys, give me a hand."
173,WARDEN:,"If we'd waited any longer, you'd be dead."
173,DEAN:,You waited long enough.
173,WARDEN:,Do yourself a favor. Don't. Talk. [to the guards] Take them both up to the infirmary.
173,DEAN:,"Hey, Tiny."
173,TINY:,Yeah?
173,DEAN:,"Hey, sorry about the things I was saying earlier. I can't really tell you why, but I had to get you angry. So, uh... Anyway, sorry."
173,TINY:,"It's okay. Truth is, I have low self-esteem issues. My old man treated me and my brother like crap, right up till the day he died."
173,DEAN:,How'd he die?
173,TINY:,My brother shot him.
173,DEAN:,Okay.
173,DEAN:,"Oh, crap."
173,TINY:,What is it?
173,TINY:,What’s going on?
173,TINY:,What is it?
173,TINY:,Oh! No! Noooo!  (Screams inarticulately)
173,DEAN:,Tiny!
173,DEAN:,Tiny!
173,DEAN:,[shouting] Guard! Guard!
173,SAM:,Wait. So you're telling me it wasn't Moody?
173,DEAN:,"Not unless he liked going around dressed like a nurse. Poor Tiny, man. Poor giant Tiny."
173,SAM:,"Wait, so this is – this is, like the ghost of some nurse who worked here or something?"
173,DEAN:,"I don't know, man. I guess."
173,SAM:,"You know what, Dean, at this point, ""I don't know"" isn't working for me. See, uh, I thought we were done. I called Deacon. It's happening. We're getting out tonight."
173,DEAN:,"I guess we got to do some quick research, then."
173,SAM:,"How? I mean, maybe you haven't noticed ... we're in jail."
173,RANDALL:,So you want to know about some nurse?
173,RANDALL:,Why you want to know?
173,DEAN:,"Well, we got our reasons. But, uh ... we'll make it worth your while."
173,DEAN:,"So, this nurse, she would have had white hair, one screwed up eye – is that ringing a bell?"
173,RANDALL:,"Yeah. Yeah, I remember her."
173,DEAN:,You remember her name?
173,RANDALL:,"No, that's still kind of fuzzy."
173,SAM:,Give it to him.
173,DEAN:,I earned these.
173,RANDALL:,Glockner. Nurse Glockner. Nasty old bitch worked here in the '70s.
173,SAM:,You knew her?
173,RANDALL:,I met her once. Had to get a tetanus shot. She damn near jabbed the needle through the other side of my arm. At least I got out of there alive.
173,SAM:,What do you mean?
173,RANDALL:,"I've heard these stories. I don't know if they were true. Cons love to talk, but we're all liars."
173,DEAN:,What kind of stories?
173,RANDALL:,"Guys would go up to the infirmary with a cold. Next thing you know, they're in a body bag. A whole rash of heart attacks – young guys, old guys."
173,SAM:,Heart attacks?
173,RANDALL:,"Yeah. Story was Glockner had it out for cons and she did this, uh, Charles Bronson thing with a hypodermic. Anyway, that was the rumor. Nobody ever proved anything."
173,DEAN:,Whatever happened to Glockner?
173,RANDALL:,"I don't know. I finished my bit and left. Next time I landed back in here, she was gone."
173,SAM:,"Okay, so let's say those stories on Glockner were true."
173,DEAN:,"It's a thought. You know, in life, she's a vigilante. In death, same thing."
173,SAM:,"Right. But then how's she tied in with the old cellblock? And if she's going after cons, why kill that one guard?"
173,DEAN:,"I did hear in the yard that that guard wasn't exactly squeaky clean, so, maybe she's going after anybody that breaks a law. Like me."
173,SAM:,You 'heard in the yard'?
173,DEAN:,Yeah.
173,SAM:,"Dean, does it ... bother you at all, how easily you seem to fit in here?"
173,DEAN:,"No, not really."
173,SAM:,"All right. Well, listen, either way, we need more info on Glockner. If -- if she's buried.  If so, where? And, we got five hours to get it. No, no. Don't give me that look.  Don't give me that ""we got to see this thing through"" look. We are leaving tonight, no matter what."
173,DEAN:,"I just don't want to let Deacon down, that's all. We do owe him."
173,SAM:,"Yeah, but we don't owe him our lives, Dean."
173,SAM:,Where you going?
173,DEAN:,I'm gonna go talk with our lawyer.
173,DEAN:,"Her name was Glockner. She worked here as a nurse in the '70s. Now, I need you to find out everything you can about her, but, most importantly how she died and where she's buried."
173,DEAN:,I have a vague notion.
173,DEAN:,"Mara – it's Mara, right?"
173,DEAN:,"I get that you're trying to help me, okay? I do, but believe me when I say that this is the best way that you can help."
173,DEAN:,"I wish I could, but I can't. I'm just gonna have to ask you to trust me on this."
173,DEAN:,"I'm a monster? I’m – [laughs] Well, he's wrong, okay? I'm not what they say I am."
173,DEAN:,"Yeah. Look, if you're as smart a P.D. as I think you are, then you can tell with just one look whether or not your clients are guilty, okay, just like that. So I want you to look at me, really look, and you tell me – am I guilty? (pause) We're not the bad guys."
173,SAM:,She go for it?
173,DEAN:,"No. No, not so much. But, uh, maybe she'll still come around."
173,SAM:,"Well, we can't wait around to find out."
173,DEAN:,We could give it another day.
173,SAM:,"No, no, no. We're leaving tonight, and that's it."
173,DEAN:,"So we're not gonna finish the job, we're just gonna let these people die?"
173,SAM:,"Don't give me that, all right? This was your stupid plan. I went along with it, but we're sticking to the plan, Dean."
173,DEAN:,"Okay. Uh, you leave. I'm gonna stay."
173,SAM:,"Hey, don't turn away. Don't turn away from me!"
173,DEAN:,Screw you.
173,SAM:,What?! Screw you!
173,WARDEN:,"All right, hard case. I see the usual methods ain't gonna work with you. [to SAM] You too, sweetheart."
173,WARDEN:,[to guard] Take off. I want to handle this alone.
173,DEAN:,"Deacon, you are beating the holy hell out of me, man."
173,DEACON:,"Sorry, Dean. I thought I was going easy on you. [DEAN laughs.]  Just, uh, trying to make it look real."
173,DEAN:,"Yeah. Well, mission accomplished."
173,SAM:,Thanks.
173,DEACON:,"So, is it over?"
173,SAM:,"No. Turns out, it wasn't Moody."
173,DEACON:,What?
173,SAM:,Yeah.
173,DEACON:,Then who?
173,SAM:,"Uh, we think it's some nurse who used to work here, but we're still shy on all the intel we need."
173,DEAN:,Which is why we should stick around until we find it.
173,DEACON:,"Oh, hey guys."
173,SAM:,"You want to have this fight for real, Dean? We gotta go."
173,DEAN:,I’m just say–
173,SAM:,We gotta go now!
173,DEACON:,Guys.
173,SAM:,"We're leaving, Dean. Otherwise, we'll be leaving in shackles for Milwaukee, with Henriksen as company."
173,DEAN:,"Oh, come on."
173,DEACON:,Guys!
173,DEACON:,Your lawyer left this for you.
173,DEAN:,"Heh heh.  Would you look at that. Man, I am freaking velvety smooth."
173,SAM:,"You want to, maybe, open it up after, you know, you're done patting yourself on the back?  (DEACON is watching SAM, smiling.)"
173,DEAN:,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
173,DEAN:,Wow.
173,SAM:,"What? You want to share with the class, Dean?"
173,DEAN:,Glockner died in the old cellblock after Moody bit it. Seems they had a little inmate uprising. She got caught in the middle. They dragged her to a solitary cell and gave her a severe cerebral edema.
173,SAM:,Someone bashed her head in.
173,DEAN:,Yeah.
173,SAM:,Does it say where she's buried?
173,DEAN:,Yep.
173,DEACON:,"All right, then, let's get you the hell out of here."
173,DEAN:,"Don't worry, Deacon. We'll get rid of this thing."
173,DEACON:,"Good, 'cause I want it out of my prison."
173,DEACON:,"Boys, uh... I can't thank you enough for this. I know it was asking a lot but you still came through. Your daddy ... raised you right."
173,SAM:,"Well, we owed you."
173,DEACON:,Yeah.
173,DEACON:,"Hope to see you again, huh? Just  ... not in here, okay?"
173,SAM:,"Yeah, we'll do our best."
173,DEAN:,Oh... Where do you want it?
173,DEACON:,What?
173,DEACON:,"Yeah, um..."
173,DEACON:,"Um... Make it look real, son."
173,DEAN:,"You know, I almost wish I could see Henriksen's face."
173,DEAN:,Yeah.
173,DEAN:,Good point.
173,DEACON:,I told you. One of them came up behind me.
173,HENRIKSEN:,You let them get the drop on you.
173,DEACON:,"Yeah. I screwed up, all right? What do you want me to say?"
173,HENRIKSEN:,I want to know where they're headed.
173,DEACON:,How the hell would I know?
173,HENRIKSEN:,Let's start over again.
173,DEACON:,For God's sake.
173,HENRIKSEN:,"Again. I want to know everything they did today, from the minute they woke up."
173,DEACON:,Got up. Breakfast. Visiting hours. Rec time.
173,HENRIKSEN:,Any visitors?
173,DEACON:,Just their lawyer.
173,HENRIKSEN:,It's an easy question. What did you and Dean talk about?
173,HENRIKSEN:,"Right, and just three hours later he just happened to bust out. Now, tell me, what he said."
173,SAM:,We got to move it. If Henriksen gets to the lawyer...
173,DEAN:,"I thought she couldn't say anything – you know, that whole lawyer-client privilege thing."
173,SAM:,"The privilege doesn't apply, Dean."
173,DEAN:,So she'll talk?
173,SAM:,She has to.
173,DEAN:,"Oh, that's freaking super."
173,HENRIKSEN:,"Let me make this simple. You don't come clean, I will put you on the hook for aiding and abetting."
173,HENRIKSEN:,"You don't think that I can? You think this is some kind of game, lady? I am the last person on planet earth you want to screw with. Now, tell me what he said."
173,HENRIKSEN:,What? Why?
173,HENRIKSEN:,What else?
173,HENRIKSEN:,Did you find out where?
173,HENRIKSEN:,Did you tell them?
173,HENRIKSEN:,Tell me.
173,SAM:,Got her.
173,GHOST:,You let those two go.
173,HENRIKSEN:,Are you sure this is the right damn cemetery?
173,REIDY:,She said Mountainside.  Mountainside Cemetery.
173,SAM:,You thought we were screwed before?
173,DEAN:,"Yeah, I know. We got to go deep this time."
173,SAM:,"""Deep,"" Dean? We should go to Yemen."
173,DEAN:,"Ooh, I'm – I'm not sure I'm ready to go that deep."
174,MARY,Good night love.
174,JOHN,Hey Dean.
174,JOHN,Hey buddy.
174,SAM,"Dean, this is my girlfriend, Jessica."
174,JESSICA,So here's to Sam and his awesome LSAT victory.
174,SAM,What would I do without you?
174,SAM,I'm not going to just ditch the job!
174,DEAN,"Screw the job, man.  I'm sick of the job anyway.  I mean, we don't get paid.  We don't get thanked.  Only thing we get's bad luck."
175,BOBBY,Storm's comin'.  And you boys ... you are smack in the middle of it.
175,DEAN,"Damn it, Sam, this whole thing is spinning out of control!"
