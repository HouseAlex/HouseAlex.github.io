193,DEAN,(hoarse) Hello?
193,DEAN,September.
193,FLASHBACK,DEAN's chest is ripped apart by the Hellhounds (3.16)
193,PRESENT,"DEAN stares at his unblemished, unscarred chest in the dingy gas station mirror. He turns his left shoulder to the mirror and pulls up the sleeve to reveal a large, raw HANDPRINT BRAND."
193,DEAN,Bobby?
193,DEAN,It's me.
193,DEAN,Dean.
193,DEAN,"Bobby, listen to me."
193,DEAN,Surprise.
193,BOBBY,"I, I don't..."
193,DEAN,"Yeah, me neither. (He enters.) But here I am."
193,DEAN,Bobby! It's me!
193,BOBBY,My ass!
193,DEAN,"(shoves a chair between himself and BOBBY, holds his hands out) Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait! Your name is Robert Steven Singer. You became a hunter after your wife got possessed, and... you're about the closest thing I have to a father. Bobby. It's me."
193,DEAN,I am not a shapeshifter!
193,BOBBY,Then you're a Revenant!
193,DEAN,"Alright. If I was either, could I do this – with a silver knife?"
193,BOBBY,(starting to believe it) Dean?
193,DEAN,That's what I've been trying to tell you.
193,BOBBY,"It's... It's good to see you, boy."
193,DEAN,"Yeah, you too."
193,BOBBY,But... how did you bust out?
193,DEAN,"I don't know. I just, uh, I just woke up in a pine box..."
193,DEAN,"I'm not a demon either, you know."
193,BOBBY,Sorry. Can't be too careful.
193,BOBBY,But... that don't make a lick of sense.
193,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, you're preachin' to the choir."
193,DEAN,"I know, I should look like a Thriller video reject."
193,BOBBY,What do you remember?
193,DEAN,"Not much. I remember I was a Hellhound's chew toy, and then... lights out. Then I come to six feet under, that was it. (BOBBY sits.) Sam's number's not working. He's, uh... he's not..."
193,BOBBY,"Oh, he's alive. As far as I know."
193,DEAN,"Good.... Wait, what do you mean, as far as you know?"
193,BOBBY,I haven't talked to him for months.
193,DEAN,"You're kidding, you just let him go off by himself?"
193,BOBBY,He was dead set on it.
193,DEAN,"Bobby, you should've been looking after him."
193,BOBBY,"I tried. These last months haven't been exactly easy, you know. For him or me. We had to bury you."
193,DEAN,"Why did you bury me, anyway?"
193,BOBBY,I wanted you salted and burned. Usual drill. But... Sam wouldn't have it.
193,DEAN,"Well, I'm glad he won that one."
193,BOBBY,He said you'd need a body when he got you back home somehow. That's about all he said.
193,DEAN,(suspicious) What do you mean?
193,BOBBY,"He was quiet. Real quiet. And then he just took off. Wouldn't return my calls. I tried to find him, but he didn't want to be found."
193,DEAN,"Oh, damnit, Sammy."
193,BOBBY,What?
193,DEAN,"Oh, he got me home okay. But whatever he did, it is bad mojo."
193,BOBBY,What makes you so sure?
193,DEAN,"You should have seen the grave site. It was like a nuke went off. And then there was this... this force, this presence, I don't know, but it, it blew past me at a fill-up joint. And then this. (He strips his jacket, pulls up his sleeve to reveal the brand.)"
193,BOBBY,(standing) What in the hell?
193,DEAN,It was like a demon just yanked me out. Or rode me out.
193,BOBBY,But why?
193,DEAN,To hold up their end of the bargain.
193,BOBBY,You think Sam made a deal.
193,DEAN,It's what I would have done.
193,DEAN,"(into the phone) Yeah, hi, I have a cell phone account with you guys, and uh, I lost my phone. I was wondering if you could turn the GPS on for me. (beat) Yeah. Name's Wedge Antilles. (beat) Social is 2-4-7-4. (beat) Thank you."
193,BOBBY,How'd you know he'd use that name?
193,DEAN,You kiddin' me? What don't I know about that kid?
193,DEAN,"(picking up one of the many empty liquor bottles scattered around) Hey, Bobby? What's the deal with the liquor store? What, are your parents out of town or something?"
193,BOBBY,Like I said. Last few months ain't been all that easy.
193,DEAN,(holds his gaze for a moment) Right.
193,DEAN,"Sam's in Pontiac, Illinois."
193,BOBBY,Right near where you were planted.
193,DEAN,"Right where I popped up. Hell of a coincidence, don't you think?"
193,DEAN,"(looks at BOBBY, confused) Where's what?"
193,DEAN,I think we got the wrong room.
193,SAM,"Hey, is..."
193,DEAN,"(quietly, with much feeling) Heya, Sammy."
193,SAM,(shouting) Who are you?!
193,DEAN,Like you didn't do this?!
193,SAM,Do what?!
193,SAM,(stares at DEAN as the struggle slowly goes out of his body) What...
193,DEAN,"(advancing cautiously, staring at SAM) I know. I look fantastic, huh?"
193,SAM,(like he's just remembered that she's there) What? No. No. He's my brother.
193,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Sorry."
193,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, sure thing, Kathy."
193,SAM,Right.
193,DEAN,"So tell me, what'd it cost?"
193,SAM,"(smiling) The girl? I don't pay, Dean."
193,SAM,You think I made a deal?
193,BOBBY,That's exactly what we think.
193,SAM,"Well, I didn't."
193,DEAN,(intensely) Don't lie to me.
193,SAM,I'm not lying.
193,DEAN,"(advancing) So what now, I'm off the hook and you're on, is that it? You're some demon's bitch-boy? I didn't want to be saved like this."
193,SAM,"(standing, angrily) Look, Dean, I wish I had done it, all right?"
193,DEAN,(grabs SAM by the front of his shirt) There's no other way that this could have gone down. Now tell the truth!
193,SAM,"(breaking DEAN'S grip) I tried everything. That's the truth. I tried opening the Devil's Gate. Hell, I tried to bargain, Dean, but no demon would deal, all right? You were rotting in Hell for months. For months, and I couldn't stop it. So I'm sorry it wasn't me, all right? Dean, I'm sorry."
193,DEAN,"(relenting) It's okay, Sammy. You don't have to apologize, I believe you."
193,BOBBY,"Don't get me wrong, I'm gladdened that Sam's soul remains intact, but it does raise a sticky question."
193,DEAN,"If he didn't pull me out, then what did?"
193,DEAN,So what were you doing around here if you weren't digging me out of my grave?
193,SAM,"Well, once I figured out I couldn't save you, I started hunting down Lilith, trying to get some payback."
193,SAM,"Uh, yeah, I'm sorry, Bobby. I should have called. I was pretty messed up."
193,DEAN,Oh yeah. I really feel your pain.
193,SAM,"Anyways, uh, I was checking these demons out of Tennessee, and out of nowhere they took a hard left, booked up here."
193,DEAN,When?
193,SAM,Yesterday morning.
193,DEAN,When I busted out.
193,BOBBY,You think these demons are here 'cause of you?
193,SAM,But why?
193,DEAN,"Well, I don't know – some badass demon drags me out and now this? It's gotta be connected somehow."
193,BOBBY,"How you feelin', anyway?"
193,DEAN,I'm a little hungry.
193,BOBBY,"No, I mean, do you feel like yourself? Anything strange, or different?"
193,DEAN,"Or demonic? Bobby, how many times do I have to prove I'm me?"
193,BOBBY,"Yeah. Well, listen. No demon's letting you loose out of the goodness of their hearts. They've gotta have something nasty planned."
193,DEAN,"Well, I feel fine."
193,SAM,"Okay, look, we don't know what they're planning. We got a pile of questions and no shovel. We need help."
193,BOBBY,"I know a psychic. A few hours from here. Something this big, maybe she's heard the other side talking."
193,DEAN,"Hell yeah, it's worth a shot."
193,BOBBY,I'll be right back
193,SAM,"Hey, wait. (stands) You probably want this back."
193,DEAN,Thanks.
193,DEAN,"What, Hell?  I don't know, I, I must have blacked it out. I don't remember a damn thing."
193,DEAN,Yeah.
193,FLASHBACK,"Closeup of DEAN'S bloody, terrified face, with screams and eerie sounds."
193,PRESENT,"DEAN pulls back from the mirror, blinking in confusion."
193,BOBBY,She's about four hours down the Interstate. Try to keep up.
193,SAM,I assume you'll want to drive.
193,DEAN,What the hell is that?
193,SAM,That's an iPod jack.
193,DEAN,"You were supposed to take care of her, not douche her up."
193,SAM,"Dean, I thought it was my car."
193,DEAN,Really?
193,DEAN,There's still one thing that's bothering me.
193,SAM,Yeah?
193,SAM,"Well, she tried. She couldn't."
193,DEAN,"What do you mean, she couldn't?"
193,SAM,"She fired this, like, burning light at me, and... didn't leave a scratch. Like I was immune or something."
193,DEAN,Immune?
193,SAM,"Yeah. I don't know who was more surprised, her or me. She left pretty fast after that."
193,DEAN,"Huh. What about Ruby, where is she?"
193,SAM,Dead. For now.
193,SAM,No.
193,DEAN,"You sure about that? Well, I mean, now that you've got... immunity, whatever the hell that is... just wondering what other kind of weirdo crap you've got going on."
193,SAM,"Nothing, Dean. Look, you didn't want me to go down that road, so I didn't go down that road. It was practically your dying wish."
193,DEAN,"Yeah, well, let's keep it that way."
193,PAMELA,Bobby!
193,BOBBY,You're a sight for sore eyes.
193,PAMELA,"So, these the boys?"
193,BOBBY,"Sam, Dean. This is Pamela Barnes, best damn psychic in the state."
193,PAMELA,"Mmm-mmm-mmm. Dean Winchester. Out of the fire and back in the frying pan, huh? Makes you a rare individual."
193,DEAN,If you say so.
193,PAMELA,Come on in.
193,BOBBY,"So, you hear anything?"
193,PAMELA,"Well, I Ouija'd my way through a dozen spirits. No one seems to know who broke your boy out, or why."
193,BOBBY,So what's next?
193,PAMELA,"A séance, I think. See if we can see who did the deed."
193,BOBBY,You're not gonna... summon the damn thing here.
193,PAMELA,No. I just want to get a sneak peek at it. Like a crystal ball without the crystal.
193,DEAN,I'm game.
193,DEAN,Who's Jesse?
193,DEAN,His loss.
193,PAMELA,Might be your gain.
193,DEAN,"Dude, I am so in."
193,SAM,"Yeah, she's gonna eat you alive."
193,DEAN,"Hey, I just got out of jail. Bring it."
193,DEAN,You are NOT invited.
193,LATER,"PAMELA, BOBBY, SAM, and DEAN are seated around the small table, which now has six lighted candles in the center."
193,DEAN,"Whoa. Well, he didn't touch me there."
193,PAMELA,My mistake.
193,DEAN,Castiel?
193,PAMELA,I can't see! I can't see! Oh god!
193,WAITRESS,Be up in a jiff.
193,SAM,(into the phone) You bet. (he sits)
193,DEAN,What'd Bobby say?
193,SAM,Pam's stable. And out of I.C.U.
193,DEAN,"And blind, because of us."
193,SAM,And we still have no clue who we're dealing with.
193,DEAN,That's not entirely true.
193,SAM,No?
193,DEAN,"We got a name. Castiel, or whatever. With the right mumbo-jumbo we could summon him, bring him right to us."
193,SAM,You're crazy. Absolutely not.
193,DEAN,"We'll work him over. I mean, after what he did?"
193,SAM,"Pam took a peek at him and her eyes burned out of her skull, and you want to have a face to face?"
193,DEAN,You got a better idea?
193,SAM,"Yeah, as a matter of fact I do. I followed some demons to town, right?"
193,DEAN,Okay.
193,SAM,"So, we go find them. Someone's gotta know something about something."
193,SAM,Thanks.
193,DEAN,You angling for a tip?
193,WAITRESS,I'm sorry. Thought you were looking for us.
193,DEAN,That's me.
193,DEAN,"I like to think it's because of my perky nipples. I don't know. Wasn't my doing, I don't know who pulled me out."
193,DEAN,No. I don't.
193,DEAN,"I'm not lying. But I'd like to find out, so if you wouldn't mind enlightening me, Flo..."
193,DEAN,"No, you won't."
193,DEAN,"No. Because if you were you would have done it already. Fact is, you don't know who cut me loose. And you're just as spooked as we are. And you're looking for answers. Well, maybe it was some turbo-charged spirit. Or, uh, Godzilla. Or some big bad boss demon. I'm guessing at your pay grade that they don't tell you squat. Because whoever it was, they want me out. And they're a lot stronger than you. So go ahead. Send me back. But don't come crawling to me when they show up on your front doorstep with some Vaseline and a fire hose."
193,DEAN,"That's what I thought. Let's go, Sam."
193,DEAN,For the pie.
193,DEAN,"Holy crap, that was close."
193,SAM,"We're not just going to leave them in there, are we, Dean?"
193,DEAN,"Well yeah, there's three of them, probably more, and we've only got one knife between us."
193,SAM,I've been killing a lot more demons than that lately.
193,DEAN,Not anymore – the smarter brother's back in town.
193,SAM,"Dean, we've got to take 'em. They are dangerous."
193,DEAN,They're scared. Okay? Scared of whatever had the juice to yank me out. We're dealing with a bad mofo here. One job at a time.
193,BOBBY,Dean!
193,BOBBY,"How you doin', kid?"
193,DEAN,"Aside from the church bells ringing in my head, peachy."
193,SAM,"Couldn't sleep, went to get a burger."
193,DEAN,In my car?
193,SAM,"Force of habit, sorry. What are you doing up?"
193,SAM,"All right, well, uh, spill some for me, huh?"
193,BOBBY,Why the hell didn't you tell him?
193,DEAN,Because he just tried to stop us.
193,BOBBY,From what?
193,BOBBY,You can't be serious!
193,DEAN,"As a heart attack. It's high noon, baby."
193,BOBBY,"Well, we don't know what it is. It could be a demon, it could be anything."
193,BOBBY,This is a bad idea.
193,DEAN,"Yeah, I couldn't agree more, but what other choice do we have?"
193,BOBBY,We could choose life.
193,DEAN,"Bobby, whatever this is, whatever it wants, it's after me. That much we know, right? I've got no place to hide. I can either get caught with my pants down again, or we can make our stand."
193,BOBBY,"Dean, we could use Sam on this."
193,DEAN,"Nah, he's better off where he is."
193,SAM,Your eyes.
193,SAM,It was here. You saw it.
193,SAM,What was it?
193,SAM,Funny. I was going to say the same thing to you.
193,SAM,Damn it.
193,SAM,"What the hell is going on around here, Ruby?"
193,RUBY,I wish I knew.
193,SAM,We were thinking some high level demon pulled Dean out.
193,RUBY,"No way. Sam, human souls don't just walk out of Hell and back into their bodies easy. The sky bleeds, the ground quakes. It's cosmic. No demon can swing that. Not Lilith, not anybody."
193,SAM,Then what can?
193,RUBY,Nothing I've ever seen before.
193,BOBBY,Traps and talismans from every faith on the globe. How you doin?
193,DEAN,"Stakes, iron, silver, salt, knife. I mean, we're pretty much set to catch and kill anything I've ever heard of."
193,BOBBY,This is still a bad idea.
193,DEAN,"Yeah, Bobby, I heard you the first ten times. What do you say we ring the dinner bell?"
193,RUBY,"So. Million dollar question, are you going to tell Dean about what we're doing?"
193,RUBY,"Sam, he's going to find out, and if it's not from you he's going to be pissed."
193,SAM,"He's going to be pissed anyway. I mean, he's so hardheaded about this psychic stuff he'll just try and stop me."
193,RUBY,Look. Maybe I'll just take a step back for a while.
193,SAM,"Ruby, you..."
193,RUBY,"I mean, I'm not exactly in your brother's fanclub. But he is your brother, and I'm not going to come between you."
193,SAM,"I don't know if what I'm doing is right. Hell, I don't even know if I trust you."
193,RUBY,Thanks.
193,SAM,But what I do know is that I'm saving people. And stopping demons. And that feels good.  I want to keep going.
193,DEAN,"Wishful thinking, but maybe it's just the wind."
193,DEAN,Who are you?
193,CASTIEL,I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.
193,DEAN,Yeah. Thanks for that.
193,CASTIEL,"We need to talk, Dean. Alone."
193,CASTIEL,Your friend's alive.
193,DEAN,Who are you?
193,CASTIEL,Castiel.
193,CASTIEL,I'm an Angel of the Lord.
193,DEAN,Get the hell out of here. There's no such thing.
193,CASTIEL,"This is your problem, Dean. You have no faith."
193,DEAN,Some angel you are. You burned out that poor woman's eyes.
193,CASTIEL,"I warned her not to spy on my true form. It can be... overwhelming to humans, and so can my real voice. But you already knew that."
193,DEAN,"You mean the gas station and the motel. That was you talking? (CASTIEL nods.) Buddy, next time, lower the volume."
193,CASTIEL,"That was my mistake. Certain people, special people, can perceive my true visage. I thought you would be one of them. I was wrong."
193,DEAN,"And what visage are you in now, huh? What, holy tax accountant?"
193,CASTIEL,This? This is... a vessel.
193,DEAN,You're possessing some poor bastard?
193,CASTIEL,"He's a devout man, he actually prayed for this."
193,DEAN,"Well, I'm not buying what you're selling, so who are you really?"
193,CASTIEL,(frowning) I told you.
193,DEAN,Right. And why would an angel rescue me from Hell?
193,CASTIEL,"Good things do happen, Dean."
193,DEAN,Not in my experience.
193,CASTIEL,What's the matter? You don't think you deserve to be saved?
193,DEAN,Why'd you do it?
193,CASTIEL,Because God commanded it. Because we have work for you.
193,CASTIEL,Your friend is alive.
193,DEAN,Who are you?
193,CASTIEL,Castiel.
193,CASTIEL,I'm an Angel of the Lord.
193,DEAN,Get the hell out of here. There's no such thing.
193,CASTIEL,"This is your problem, Dean. You have no faith."
193,DEAN,Some angel you are. You burned out that poor woman's eyes.
193,CASTIEL,"I warned her not to spy on my true form. It can be... overwhelming to humans, and so can my real voice. But you already knew that."
193,DEAN,"You mean the gas station and the motel. (CASTIEL nods.) Buddy, next time, lower the volume."
193,CASTIEL,"That was my mistake. Certain people, special people, can perceive my true visage. I thought you would be one of them. I was wrong."
193,DEAN,"And what visage are you in now, huh? What, holy tax accountant?"
193,CASTIEL,This? This is... a vessel.
193,DEAN,You're possessing some poor bastard?
193,CASTIEL,"He's a devout man, he actually prayed for this."
193,DEAN,"Uh-huh. Y'know, it might've been easier to show up like this the first time instead of all the burning bush crap."
193,CASTIEL,Finding a human vessel durable enough to contain me... it's not easy.
193,DEAN,I have that same problem with women.
193,DEAN,"Look, pal, I'm not buying what you're selling, so who are you really?"
193,CASTIEL,(frowning) I told you.
193,DEAN,Right. And why would an angel rescue me from Hell?
193,CASTIEL,"Good things do happen, Dean."
193,DEAN,Not in my experience.
193,CASTIEL,What's the matter? You don't think you deserve to be saved?
193,DEAN,Why'd you do it?
193,CASTIEL,Because God commanded it. Because we have work for you.
202,SAM,You want Anna? Why?
202,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, I know she's wiretapping your angel chats or whatever, but it's no reason to gank her."
202,URIEL,Don't worry. I'll kill her gentle.
202,DEAN,"You're some heartless sons of bitches, you know that?"
202,CASTIEL,"As a matter of fact, we are. And?"
202,SAM,And? Anna's an innocent girl.
202,CASTIEL,She is far from innocent.
202,SAM,What's that supposed to mean?
202,URIEL,It means she's worse than this abomination you've been screwing. Now give us the girl.
202,DEAN,Sorry. Get yourself another one. Try JDate.
202,URIEL,Who's gonna stop us? You two? Or this demon whore?
202,SAM,"Cas, stop...please."
202,URIEL,I've been waiting for this.
202,DEAN,What the...
202,DEAN,Come on.
202,DEAN,Anna. Anna!
202,ANNA,Are they -- are they gone?
202,DEAN,Did you kill them?
202,ANNA,No. I sent them away... far away.
202,DEAN,You want to tell me how?
202,ANNA,That just popped in my head. I don't know how I did it. I just did it.
202,DEAN,"So, what do you think?"
202,SAM,I think Anna's getting more interesting by the second.
202,DEAN,"Yeah, I agree. And what did they mean by ""she's not innocent""?"
202,SAM,"It seems like they want her bad, and not just 'cause of the angel radio thing. I mean, that blood spell --  Some serious crap, man."
202,SAM,What are you gonna do?
202,DEAN,"Anna may have sent the angels to the outfield, but, sooner or later, they're gonna be back. We got to get ourselves safe now."
202,DEAN,Iron walls drenched in salt. Demons can't even touch the joint.
202,RUBY,"Which I find racist, by the way."
202,DEAN,Write your congressman.
202,RUBY,Here.
202,DEAN,Hex bags?
202,RUBY,"Extra-crunchy. They'll hide us from angels, demons, all comers."
202,DEAN,"Thanks, Ruby. [ to ANNA ] Don't lose this. So, Anna, what's playing on angel radio? Anything useful?"
202,ANNA,It's quiet. Dead silence.
202,DEAN,Good. That's not troubling at all.
202,ANNA,"We're in trouble, huh? You guys are scared?"
202,DEAN,Nah.
202,DEAN,"Just stay here, okay? [ to RUBY ] Keep an eye on her."
202,DEAN,How's the car?
202,SAM,I got her. She's fine. Where's Bobby?
202,DEAN,"Uh, The Dominican. He said we break anything, we buy it."
202,DEAN,"God, I hope so. Otherwise, he's at hedonism in a banana hammock and a trucker cap."
202,SAM,Now that's seared in my brain.
202,DEAN,"All right, what did you find on Anna?"
202,SAM,"Uh, not much. Her parents were, uh, Rich and Amy Milton -- a church deacon and a housewife."
202,DEAN,No?
202,SAM,"When she was 2 1/2, she'd get hysterical any time her dad got close. She was convinced that he wasn't her real daddy."
202,DEAN,"Who was? The plumber, hmm? A little snaking the pipes?"
202,SAM,"Dude, you're confusing reality with porn again. Look, Anna didn't say. She just kept repeating that this real father of hers was mad. Very mad -- like wanted-to-kill-her mad."
202,DEAN,Kind of heavy for a 2-year-old.
202,SAM,"Well, she saw a kid's shrink, got better, and grew up normal."
202,DEAN,"Until now. So, what's she hiding?"
202,ANNA,Why don't you just ask me to my face?
202,DEAN,Nice job watching her.
202,RUBY,I'm watching her.
202,SAM,"No, you're right, Anna. Is there anything you want to tell us?"
202,ANNA,About what?
202,SAM,The angels said you were guilty of something. Why would they say that?
202,ANNA,You tell me. Tell me why my life has been leveled... Why my parents are dead. I don't know. I swear. I would give anything to know.
202,SAM,Okay. Then let's find out.
202,ANNA,How?
202,DEAN,We're here!
202,SAM,"Pamela, hey!"
202,SAM,Yeah.
202,SAM,I'm right here.
202,PAMELA,"Oh. Know how I can tell? [ grabs SAM's ass ] That perky little ass of yours. You could bounce a nickel off that thing. Of course I know it's you, grumpy. Same way I know that's a demon, and that poor girl's Anna and that you've been eyeing my rack."
202,SAM,Uh... uh... uh...
202,PAMELA,"Don't sweat it, kiddo. I still got more senses than most."
202,SAM,Got it.
202,PAMELA,"Hey, Anna. How are you? I'm Pamela."
202,ANNA,Hi.
202,PAMELA,Dean told me what's been going on. I'm excited to help.
202,ANNA,Oh. That's nice of you.
202,PAMELA,"Oh, well, not really. Any chance I can dick over an angel, I'm taking it."
202,ANNA,Why?
202,PAMELA,"They stole something from me. [ takes off her sunglasses, revealing white eyes ] Demon-y, I know. But they're just plastic. Good for business. Makes me look extra-psychic, don't you think? [ laughs ] Now...how about you tell me what your deal is? Hmm? Don't you worry."
202,PAMELA,"Nice and relaxed. Now, I'm going to count down from five to zero. When we're at zero, you'll be in a deep state of hypnosis. As I count down, just go deeper and deeper, okay? 5... 4... 3... 2... 1. Deep sleep. Deep sleep. Every muscle calm and relaxed. Can you hear me?"
202,ANNA,I can hear you.
202,PAMELA,"Now, Anna, tell me... How can you hear the angels? How did you work that spell?"
202,ANNA,I don't know. I just did.
202,PAMELA,Your father... What's his name?
202,ANNA,Rich Milton.
202,PAMELA,All right. But I want you to look further back... When you were very young... Just a couple of years old.
202,ANNA,I don't want to.
202,PAMELA,"It'll be okay. Anna, just one look -- that's all we need."
202,ANNA,No.
202,PAMELA,What's your dad's name? Your real dad. Why is he angry at you?
202,ANNA,No. No! No. [ screams ] No!
202,ANNA,[screams ] He's gonna kill me!
202,PAMELA,"Anna, you're safe."
202,ANNA,[ screams ] No! [ the lights explode and glass shatters ]
202,PAMELA,Calm down.
202,ANNA,[screams ] He's gonna kill me!
202,PAMELA,"It's all right, Anna."
202,DEAN,Anna?
202,PAMELA,"Dean, don't."
202,PAMELA,"Wake in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Anna... Anna? You all right?"
202,ANNA,"Thank you, Pamela. That helps a lot. I remember now."
202,SAM,Remember what?
202,ANNA,Who I am.
202,DEAN,I'll bite. Who are you?
202,ANNA,I'm an angel.
202,ANNA,"Don't be afraid, I'm not like the others."
202,RUBY,I don't find that very reassuring.
202,PAMELA,Neither do I.
202,SAM,You know them?
202,ANNA,We were kind of in the same foxhole.
202,DEAN,"So, what, were they like your bosses or something?"
202,ANNA,Try the other way around.
202,DEAN,Look at you.
202,PAMELA,But now they want to kill you?
202,ANNA,Orders are orders. I'm sure I have a death sentence on my head.
202,PAMELA,Why?
202,ANNA,"I disobeyed... which, for us, is about the worst thing you can do. I fell."
202,DEAN,Meaning?
202,PAMELA,"She fell to earth, became human."
202,SAM,"Wait a minute. I don't understand. So, angels can just become human?"
202,ANNA,It kind of hurts. Try cutting your kidney out with a butter knife. That kind of hurt. I ripped out my grace.
202,DEAN,Come again?
202,ANNA,"My grace. It's... energy. Hacked it out and fell. My mother, Amy, couldn't get pregnant. Always called me her little miracle. She had no idea how right she was."
202,DEAN,"So, you just forgot that you were God's little Power Ranger?"
202,ANNA,"The older I got, the longer I was human, yeah."
202,RUBY,I don't think you all appreciate how completely screwed we are.
202,ANNA,Ruby's right. Heaven wants me dead.
202,RUBY,"And Hell just wants her. A flesh-and-blood angel that you can question, torture, that bleeds. Sister, you're the Stanley Cup. And sooner or later, Heaven or Hell, they're gonna find you."
202,ANNA,I know. And that's why I'm gonna get it back.
202,SAM,What?
202,ANNA,My grace.
202,ANNA,If I can find it.
202,DEAN,"So, what, you're just gonna take some divine bong hit, and, shazam, you're Roma Downey?"
202,ANNA,Something like that.
202,DEAN,"All right. I like this plan. So, where's this grace of yours?"
202,ANNA,"Lost track. I was falling about 10,000 miles per hour at the time."
202,SAM,"Wait. You mean falling, like, literally?"
202,ANNA,Yes.
202,SAM,"Like the way a human eye can see? Like a comet, maybe, or a meteor?"
202,ANNA,Why do you ask?
202,SAM,"Here. In march '85, a meteorite vanished in the night sky over northwestern Ohio. It was sighted nine months before Anna was born, and she was born in that part of Ohio."
202,RUBY,You're pretty buff for a nerd.
202,SAM,"Look, I think it was Anna and here, same time -- another meteor over Kentucky."
202,RUBY,And that's her grace?
202,SAM,Might be.
202,RUBY,All right. That just narrows it down to an entire state.
202,SAM,"Look, it's a start."
202,RUBY,Sam... I'm sorry.
202,SAM,For what?
202,RUBY,"For bringing you this mess. If I had known, I would have kept my trap shut."
202,SAM,"Yeah, well, we'll muddle through."
202,RUBY,"Not this time. You do not want to get between these two armies. It's Godzilla and Mothra. If one side doesn't get us, the other one will."
202,SAM,"So, what do you want to do? Dump Anna and run? Forget it. Look, I know the angels freak you out."
202,RUBY,Forget the angels. It's Alastair I'm scared of.
202,RUBY,You met him in the church. Practically the grand inquisitor downstairs. Picasso with a razor.
202,SAM,And?
202,RUBY,And you should pull him out and throw him back in the pit... if you weren't so out of shape.
202,SAM,Ruby...
202,RUBY,"No, your abilities -- you're getting flabby."
202,SAM,"Yeah, so how do I tone up?"
202,RUBY,You know how. You know what you got to do.
202,SAM,"No, I'm not doing that anymore."
202,SAM,I said no.
202,RUBY,"Well, then you better pray that Anna gets her groove back, or we're all dead."
202,ANNA,Pamela get home okay?
202,DEAN,"Yeah. She said she was sorry. It's just after last time, she, uh... This is just a little too rich for her blood."
202,ANNA,I don't blame her. You guys should do the same.
202,DEAN,"Well, we're not that smart. Can I ask you something? What do they want me for? Why did they save me?"
202,ANNA,I'm sorry. The angels aren't talking about it. And it was after I fell.
202,DEAN,That's another question. Why would you fall? Why would you want to be one of us?
202,ANNA,You don't mean that.
202,DEAN,"I don't? A bunch of -- of miserable bastards... Eating, crapping, confused, afraid."
202,ANNA,I don't know. There's loyalty... forgiveness... love.
202,ANNA,Chocolate cake.
202,ANNA,Sex.
202,DEAN,"Yeah, you got me there."
202,ANNA,"I mean it. Every emotion, Dean, even the bad ones... It's why I fell. It's why... why I'd give anything not to have to go back. Anything."
202,DEAN,"Feelings are overrated, if you ask me."
202,ANNA,Beats being an angel.
202,DEAN,How's that possible? You guys are powerful and perfect. You don't doubt yourselves or God or anything.
202,ANNA,"Perfect... Like a marble statue. Cold... no choice... only obedience. Dean, do you know how many angels have actually seen God? Seen his face?"
202,DEAN,All of you?
202,ANNA,Four angels. Four. And I'm not one of them.
202,DEAN,"That's it? Well, then how do you even know that there is a God?"
202,ANNA,We have to take it on faith... Which we're killed if we don't have.
202,DEAN,Huh.
202,ANNA,"I was stationed on earth 2,000 years. Just... watching... silent... invisible... out on the road... sick for home... waiting on orders from an unknowable father I can't begin to understand. So don't tell me that --"
202,ANNA,What is so funny? What?
202,DEAN,Nothing. Sorry. It's just...I can relate.
202,SAM,Hey.
202,DEAN,Did you find something?
202,SAM,I think so.
202,SAM,"Union, Kentucky. Found some accounts of a local miracle."
202,SAM,"Yeah. In '85, there was an empty field outside of town. Six months later, there was a full-grown oak. They say it looks a century old at least."
202,DEAN,"Anna, what do you think?"
202,ANNA,"The grace. Where it hit, it could have done something like that, easy."
202,DEAN,So grace ground zero -- it's not destruction. It's...
202,ANNA,Pure creation.
202,RUBY,What?
202,DEAN,Nothing. It's just an angel and a demon riding in the backseat. It's like the setup to a bad joke... or a Penthouse Forum letter.
202,SAM,Dude... Reality... Porn.
202,DEAN,You call this reality?
202,DEAN,It's beautiful.
202,ANNA,It's where the grace touched down. I can feel it.
202,DEAN,You ready to do this?
202,ANNA,Not really.
202,SAM,"Anna, what are we even looking for?"
202,ANNA,It doesn't matter. It's not here. Not anymore. Someone took it.
202,DEAN,We still got the hex bags. I say we head back to the panic room.
202,RUBY,"What, forever?"
202,DEAN,I'm just thinking out loud!
202,RUBY,"Oh, you call that thinking?"
202,SAM,"Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Stop it."
202,RUBY,"Anna's grace is gone. You understand? She can't angel up. She can't protect us. We can't fight Heaven and Hell. One side maybe, but not both. Not at once."
202,ANNA,Um... guys? The angels are talking again.
202,SAM,What are they saying?
202,ANNA,"It's weird... Like a recording... a loop. It says, ""Dean Winchester gives us Anna by midnight, or..."""
202,DEAN,Or what?
202,ANNA,"""...or we hurl him back to damnation."""
202,SAM,Anna.. Do you know of any weapon that works on an angel? To what? To kill them?
202,ANNA,Nothing we could get to... Not right now.
202,DEAN,"Okay, wait, wait. I say we call Bobby. We get him back from hedonism."
202,SAM,"Dean, what's he gonna tell us that we don't already know?"
202,DEAN,"I don't know, but we got to think of something!"
202,DEAN,Hey. Holding up okay?
202,ANNA,Trying.
202,DEAN,Yeah.
202,ANNA,"A little scared, I guess. So, um... Dean... I just wanted to thank you."
202,DEAN,For what?
202,ANNA,Everything. You guys -- you didn't have to help me --
202,DEAN,"Hey, let's can the ""thanks for trying"" speech, you know? Participation trophies suck ass."
202,ANA,I don't know. Maybe I don't deserve to be saved.
202,DEAN,Don't talk like that.
202,ANNA,"I disobeyed. Lucifer disobeyed. It's our murder one, and I knew it. Maybe I got to pay."
202,DEAN,"Yeah, well, we've all done things we got to pay for."
202,ANNA,I got to tell you something. You're not gonna like it.
202,DEAN,Okay. what?
202,ANNA,"About a week ago, I heard the angels talking... About you... What you did in Hell. Dean, I know. It wasn't your fault. You should forgive yourself."
202,DEAN,"Anna, I don't w-want to, uh... I don't want to... I can't talk about that."
202,ANNA,"I know. But when you can, you have people that want to help. You are not alone. That's all I'm trying to say."
202,DEAN,What was that for?
202,ANNA,You know... Our last night on earth... All that.
202,DEAN,You're stealing my best line.
202,ALASTAIR,"Hello, Ruby."
202,RUBY,Alastair.
202,ALASTAIR,"I have to say, I'm surprised to find you out in the open like this."
202,RUBY,Yeah? Desperate times.
202,ALASTAIR,That they are. You looking for this? [ takes out Ruby's knife ] Your gawky human friend gave it to me.
202,RUBY,Keep it. I just came to talk.
202,ALASTAIR,About what? About how a demon is protecting an angel? We really must revoke your membership.
202,RUBY,"Look, I know I'm not employee of the month, but this -- I never wanted to get in the middle of this."
202,ALASTAIR,"Why are you here, Ruby?"
202,RUBY,I'll give you the angel.
202,ALASTAIR,Will you? And in return?
202,RUBY,"I walk away. Me and the Winchester boys, both of them. This angel business is none of our business."
202,ALASTAIR,"Hmm. You know...I'd always heard that you were a devious, cowardly little slut. You don't disappoint."
202,RUBY,"So, what do you say?"
202,ALASTAIR,It's interesting... Prudent.
202,ALASTAIR,"But, uh... Let me make you a... counteroffer."
202,URIEL,Look at that. It's so cute when monkeys wear clothes.
202,DEAN,"I'm dreaming, aren't I?"
202,URIEL,It's the only way we could chat... since you're hiding like cowards.
202,DEAN,Don't normally see you off leash. Where's your boss?
202,URIEL,"Castiel? Oh, he, uh... He's not here. See, he has this weakness. He likes you. Time's up, boy. We want the girl."
202,DEAN,"Wouldn't try that if I were you. See, she got her grace back. Full-blown angel now."
202,URIEL,"That would be a neat trick, considering... [ takes out a necklace ] ...I have her grace right here. We can't let Hell get their hooks into her."
202,DEAN,"Well, then why don't you just give her back her angel juice?"
202,URIEL,She committed a serious crime.
202,DEAN,What? Thinking for herself?
202,URIEL,"This is our business, not yours. She's not even human... Not technically."
202,DEAN,"Yeah, well, I guess I just like being a pain in the pooper."
202,URIEL,No. There's more. You cut yourself a slice of... angel food cake. Didn't you? Huh? You did.
202,DEAN,"What do you care? You're junkless down there, right? Like a Ken doll?"
202,DEAN,"Or what? What, you're gonna toss me back in the hole? You're bluffing."
202,URIEL,"Try me. This is a whole lot bigger than the plans we got for you, Dean. You can be replaced."
202,DEAN,What the hell? Go ahead and do it.
202,URIEL,"You're just crazy enough to go, aren't you?"
202,DEAN,What can I say? I don't break easy.
202,URIEL,"Oh, yes... you do. You just got to know where to apply the right pressure."
202,ALASTAIR,"You know the problem with your generation? Instant gratification. It's all now, now, now. No patience, no craftsmanship. But I do have to say... This knife of yours... It's an exquisite piece. You must tell me where you found it. You know... I haven't been up here since Poland '43. Truth is, I loathe it. It's chilly. No stink of blood or sizzle of flesh or the wet flap of flayed skin. I don't know how you stand it. So, the sooner you cooperate, the sooner I can finish up with this ghastly angel business and return home to my studies. But no rush. Let's take our time... Relish the moment. Now, I'm going to remove this, but don't you go smoking out of that meat. You won't get very far."
202,RUBY,Oh!
202,ALASTAIR,Now you tell me where that angel is.
202,ALASTAIR,No?
202,RUBY,"No. I tell you, you kill me. But I'll show you."
202,SAM,"I don't know, man. Where's Ruby?"
202,DEAN,"Hey, she's your Hell buddy."
202,ANNA,"Little early for that, isn't it?"
202,DEAN,It's 2 a.m. somewhere.
202,ANNA,You okay?
202,DEAN,"Yeah, of course."
202,CASTIEL,"Hello, Anna. It's good to see you."
202,SAM,How? How did you find us? [ pause ] Dean?
202,DEAN,[to ANNA] I'm sorry.
202,SAM,Why?
202,ANNA,Because they gave him a choice. They either kill me... or kill you. I know how their minds work.
202,ANNA,You did the best you could. I forgive you. Okay. No more tricks. No more running. I'm ready.
202,CASTIEL,I'm sorry.
202,ANNA,No. You're not. Not really. You don't know the feeling.
202,ANNA,Orders are orders. I know. Just make it quick.
202,ALASTAIR,Don't you touch a hair on that poor girl's head.
202,URIEL,How dare you come in this room... you pussing sore?
202,ALASTAIR,"Name-calling. That hurt my feelings... You sanctimonious, fanatical prick."
202,CASTIEL,Turn around and walk away now.
202,ALASTAIR,Sure. Just give us the girl. We'll make sure she gets punished good and proper.
202,CASTIEL,You know who we are and what we will do. I won't say it again. Leave now... or we lay you to waste.
202,ALASTAIR,Think I'll take my chances.
202,ALASTAIR,"Sorry, kiddo. Why don't you go run to daddy?"
202,DEMON,Aaaaahhhh!
202,ALASTAIR,"Potestas inferna, me confirma. Potestas inferna, me confirma. Potestas inferma, me confirma!"
202,ALASTAIR,"Dean, Dean, Dean... I am so disappointed. You had such promise."
202,URIEL,No!
202,ANNA,Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes! Shut your eyes!
202,DEAN,"Well, what are you guys waiting for? Go get Anna. Unless, of course, you're scared."
202,URIEL,This isn't over.
202,DEAN,"Oh, it looks over to me, junkless."
202,SAM,You okay?
202,RUBY,Not so much.
202,DEAN,What took you so long to get here?
202,RUBY,Sorry I'm late with the demon delivery. I was only being tortured.
202,DEAN,"I got to hand it to you, Sammy. Bringing them all together all at once -- angels and demons. It was a damn good plan."
202,SAM,"Yeah, well, when you got Godzilla and Mothra on your ass, best to get out of their way and let them fight."
202,DEAN,"Yeah, now you're just bragging."
202,SAM,"So, I guess she's some big-time angel now, huh? She must be happy... Wherever she is."
202,DEAN,I doubt it.
202,DEAN,I can't believe we made it out of there.
202,SAM,Again.
202,DEAN,I know you heard him.
202,SAM,Who?
202,DEAN,Alastair. What he said... about how I had promise.
202,SAM,I heard him.
202,DEAN,You're not curious?
202,SAM,"Dean, I'm damn curious. But you're not talking about Hell, and I'm not pushing."
202,DEAN,"It wasn't four months, you know."
202,SAM,What?
202,DEAN,"It was four months up here, but down there... I don't know. Time's different. It was more like 40 years."
202,SAM,My God.
202,DEAN,"They, uh... They sliced and carved and tore at me in ways that you... Until there was nothing left. And then, suddenly... I would be whole again... like magic... just so they could start in all over. And Alastair... at the end of every day... every one... he would come over. And he would make me an offer. To take me off the rack... if I put souls on... if I started the torturing. And every day, I told him to stick it where the sun shines. For 30 years, I told him. But then I couldn't do it anymore, Sammy. I couldn't. And I got off that rack. God help me, I got right off it, and I started ripping them apart. I lost count of how many souls. [ a tear rolls down his cheek ] The -- the things that I did to them."
202,SAM,"Dean... Dean, look, you held out for 30 years. That's longer than anyone would have."
202,DEAN,"[ crying ] How I feel... This... inside me... I wish I couldn't feel anything, Sammy. I wish I couldn't feel a damn thing."
203,TV,"Following the Civil War, the eyes of the nation turned to the West, where outposts like Fort Bellows served as—"
203,BILL,"Aw, come on. Crap."
203,BILL,What the hell?! Man.
203,BILL,You? I-It's impossible. Just stay away from me! Just stay away from me!
203,SAM,What are you doing?
203,DEAN,What's it look like I'm doing?
203,SAM,Like you're looking for a job.
203,DEAN,Yahtzee.
203,SAM,We just finished a job like two hours ago.
203,DEAN,"Adrenaline's still pumping, I guess. So, what do you think... Cedar Rapids, Tulsa, or Chi-Town?"
203,SAM,I am all for working. I really am. But you got us chasing cases nonstop for like a month now. We need sleep.
203,DEAN,"Yeah, we can sleep when we're dead."
203,SAM,"You're exhausted, Dean."
203,DEAN,I'm good.
203,SAM,"No, you're not. You're running on fumes, and you can't run forever."
203,DEAN,And what am I running from?
203,SAM,From what you told me. Or are we pretending that never happened?
203,DEAN,"Stratton, Nebraska. Farm town. A man gets hacked to death in a locked room inside a locked house. No signs of forced entry."
203,SAM,Sounds like a ghost.
203,DEAN,"Yes, it does."
203,DEAN,"Boy, three bedrooms, two baths, and one homicide. This place is gonna sell like hotcakes."
203,DEAN,"Hey, check this out."
203,DEAN,Huh.
203,SAM,It's probably a dumbwaiter. All these old houses had them.
203,DEAN,Know-it-all.
203,SAM,What?
203,DEAN,What?
203,SAM,You said...
203,DEAN,What?
203,SAM,Never mind.
203,DEAN,"Well, no bloodstains, fresh coat of paint, it's a bunch of bubkes."
203,SAM,Needle's all over the place.
203,DEAN,Yeah—power lines.
203,SAM,Great.
203,SAM,Uh...
203,DEAN,"Well, that's super-disturbing."
203,SAM,Think it got left behind?
203,DEAN,By who? Unless Bill Gibson likes to play with doll heads.
203,SAM,Uh-oh.
203,DEAN,I thought you said this place was still for sale.
203,SAM,"Apparently, it's not."
203,DANNY,"Come on, Buster! Good dog!"
203,SUSAN,"What do you think? It's nice, right?"
203,KATE,Did anyone bother to check if we get a signal out here?
203,BRIAN,"Actually, I did, Kate. But we decided to move anyway, just to ruin your life. Come on. Let's unpack."
203,KATE,"Uncle Ted, please back me up here."
203,TED,"Kid's right, Bri. You're ruining her life."
203,KATE,See?
203,BRIAN,"Thanks for the help, Uncle Ted."
203,TED,"Calling it like I see it, buddy."
203,SUSAN,Hey.
203,BRIAN,What?
203,SUSAN,Be nice.
203,BRIAN,I am nice. What do you think? We do okay?
203,SUSAN,I don't know.
203,KATE,Who are they?
203,BRIAN,Can I help you?
203,SAM,Hi. Are you the new owner?
203,BRIAN,Yeah. You guys are...?
203,DEAN,This is Mr. Stanwyk. I'm Mr. Babar. County code enforcement.
203,BRIAN,We had the building inspected last week. Is there a problem?
203,SAM,"Asbestos in the walls, a gas leak—yeah, I'd say we got a problem."
203,SUSAN,Asbestos? Meaning what?
203,SAM,"Meaning until this house is up to code, it's uninhabitable."
203,BRIAN,Whoa whoa whoa. You're saying we can't stay here?
203,DEAN,It's a health hazard. You don't want to.
203,TED,Hold up. We just drove four hundred miles.
203,DEAN,"There's a motel just down the road. Till this gets cleaned up, I suggest you stay there."
203,BRIAN,"All right, and what if we don't?"
203,DEAN,"Well, you get a fine or you go to jail. Pick your poison."
203,BRIAN,"One night. One night, and I'll take care of everything, ASAP, I promise."
203,DEAN,"Yeah, you do that."
203,KATE,"Another motel? Awesome, Dad. I hope this one has hooker sheets, like the last one."
203,SUSAN,Danny!
203,BRIAN,"Come on, Danny!"
203,SAM,"What did the room look like when you found it, Mrs. Curry?"
203,DEAN,And Mr. Gibson—where was he?
203,SAM,How long have you been cleaning Mr. Gibson's house?
203,DEAN,So you knew him pretty well.
203,SAM,What do you mean?
203,DEAN,Thanks. Can we keep these?
203,SAM,"Now, why'd the daughter kill herself?"
203,DEAN,Did you ever notice anything odd in the house when you were cleaning it?
203,DEAN,"Like, you know, like lights going on and off, things not being where you left them."
203,SAM,What's that?
203,DEAN,Like a rat?
203,DEAN,"Must have been some big sons of guns out there, huh?"
203,SAM,Do you happen to know where Mrs. Gibson and her daughter were buried?
203,SAM,All right. So it probably wasn't the mom or the daughter. Whose ghost was it?
203,DEAN,I don't know. But I say we give that place a real once-over and see.
203,TED,"Code enforcement, my ass. There's no asbestos."
203,BRIAN,You sure?
203,TED,"Hell yes. I've built enough homes to know that. No gas leak, either."
203,BRIAN,Who were those guys?
203,TED,Not from the county—I can tell you that.
203,SUSAN,Hey!
203,SUSAN,You okay?
203,KATE,"Yeah. I just thought I saw something, that's all."
203,SUSAN,"It—it's gonna be great here, Kate. It really is."
203,KATE,"Yeah, Mom. I'm sure. Everything's gonna change."
203,SUSAN,Danny! Are you unpacking?
203,DANNY,"Uh, yeah. I'm almost finished."
203,DANNY,Hello? It's okay. I'm Danny. Hi!
203,SUSAN,"""Zucchini will grow, but the soil is too acidic for beets."" Do you understand any of this?"
203,BRIAN,Can you smell that?
203,BRIAN,That. It smells like a raccoon died up there or something.
203,SUSAN,That's pleasant. Thank you. Can I continue having a conversation with myself?
203,BRIAN,"Well, I'm listening. A...vegetable... garden."
203,SUSAN,"What are we doing, Bri?"
203,BRIAN,What do you mean?
203,SUSAN,Us. On a farm. Talking about zucchini.
203,BRIAN,It's gonna be different. I promise you. We're gonna be happy.
203,SUSAN,And if we're not?
203,BRIAN,We will be. We have to be.
203,SUSAN,I can't put the kids through another year like the last.
203,DEAN,"Crap. So, what now?"
203,SAM,We could tell them the truth.
203,DEAN,Really?
203,SAM,"No, not really."
203,TED,"Hey, guys! You're gonna want to come see this!"
203,SUSAN,What the...
203,BRIAN,Crayon. Danny!
203,DANNY,Yeah?
203,BRIAN,Get your butt down here!
203,TED,Tell you what—if my kid did this—
203,SUSAN,"He's not your kid, Ted. Just butt out."
203,SUSAN,Hey. Go easy on him. The teacher said he might act out.
203,BRIAN,"Hey, buddy. Something you want to tell me and your mom?"
203,DANNY,I didn't do that.
203,BRIAN,"Okay. Look, just tell me the truth, and all you got to do is clean it up, okay? No punishment."
203,DANNY,But I didn't. The girl in the walls did it.
203,SUSAN,The girl in the walls?
203,DANNY,She wants you to go and me to stay.
203,BRIAN,"All right, one last time—the truth, buddy."
203,DANNY,"That is the truth. I can stay, but she hate grownups. And if you don't leave, she's gonna get really, really mad!"
203,BRIAN,"All right, go to your room."
203,DANNY,"Mom! If Andy were here, he'd believe me!"
203,BRIAN,Upstairs! Now!
203,KATE,"It's okay, Buster. It's okay. I hate it here, too."
203,KATE,"Ugh. Ew, Buster! Gross! What's the matter with you?"
203,KATE,"Oh, my god. Oh, god."
203,KATE,Ew! Ew!
203,SUSAN,It's okay.
203,DANNY,What's going on?
203,BRIAN,"Katie, baby, baby. Calm down and tell us what happened."
203,KATE,I just got molested by Casper the pervy ghost! That's what happened!
203,BRIAN,Ghost?
203,KATE,"Yes, dad! A ghost!"
203,DANNY,It's the girl in the walls!
203,KATE,Who?!
203,BRIAN,"Both of you, knock it off."
203,DEAN,We heard screams. What's going on?
203,BRIAN,"Oh, you two! Did you touch my daughter?!"
203,DEAN,What? No.
203,BRIAN,Who are you guys?
203,SAM,"Relax, please. You have a ghost."
203,BRIAN,A ghost.
203,KATE,I told you!
203,DANNY,It's the girl!
203,BRIAN,"Both of you, relax. What are you guys playing?"
203,DEAN,Your family's in danger. You need to get out of the house now.
203,TED,What the hell?
203,DEAN,Nobody move!
203,DANNY,Buster!
203,BRIAN,Buster! Buster? Buster! Buster!
203,TED,What the hell?
203,DANNY,Buster!
203,BRIAN,Go back inside. Go!
203,DEAN,"We are not the bad guys, but you're in danger."
203,SAM,First thing's first. You got to get your family out of here.
203,DEAN,Head to the motel I was talking about. You'll be safe there.
203,BRIAN,What are you two gonna do?
203,DEAN,"Oh, no! Oh, come on! Oh, come on!"
203,SAM,"Dude, the guns are gone. So is the... Basically, everything is gone."
203,TED,Truck's no good.
203,BRIAN,Both tires slashed.
203,DEAN,What kind of ghost messes with a man's wheels?!
203,KATE,What's going on? What's going on?
203,KATE,She's there! She's there!
203,SUSAN,Where?!
203,KATE,She was right there in the woods!
203,DEAN,What's a ghost doing outside?
203,SAM,You want to stay and find out?
203,DEAN,Everybody inside.
203,TED,Are you crazy? We need to get the hell out of here!
203,DEAN,In what?! This ghost is hunting us! Everybody back inside now! Move!
203,DEAN,"Whatever's outside, it can't get in this circle. As long as the salt line is unbroken, this is the safest place to be."
203,BRIAN,Safe from ghosts?
203,DEAN,"Yes, as a matter of fact."
203,BRIAN,Okay. I'm not listening to this anymore. Come on. I got to get my family out of here. Let's go.
203,DEAN,Nobody's going anywhere until we kill this thing.
203,SAM,"Sir, please. This is what we do. Just...trust us."
203,DANNY,You hunt ghosts?
203,DEAN,That's right.
203,DANNY,Like Scooby-Doo?
203,DEAN,Better.
203,SAM,"You saw her outside, right? Okay. Does she look like either one of the girls?"
203,KATE,"Her. She was paler and a lot dirtier, but that was her."
203,DANNY,That's the girl in the walls.
203,SAM,So it's the daughter?
203,SUSAN,That girl in the picture—She-She's dead?
203,SAM,She killed herself inside this house.
203,DEAN,"So, what. The maid got her story wrong? Rebecca wasn't cremated?"
203,SAM,Unless her spirit's just attached to something inside the house.
203,DEAN,"She hung herself in the attic, right?"
203,SAM,You want to babysit? I'll check it out.
203,TED,"Look—I don't care who hung themselves where. Maybe something is going on here, but—"
203,DEAN,"It's a spirit, man."
203,DEAN,"Well, nobody's leaving the house."
203,TED,Stop me.
203,DEAN,"Listen, man. I've got a gun. You don't get your ass back in that circle, you're gonna have yourself a third hole."
203,SAM,"Dude, you don't have a gun."
203,DEAN,And? I'm not letting that bastard or anyone else die tonight.
203,SAM,You cool?
203,DEAN,Go.
203,TED,"Hey. Fonzie. Question for you. This indestructible force field made out of salt... Have to be kosher stuff, or what?"
203,SUSAN,"Knock it off, Ted."
203,SUSAN,Sh..
203,KATE,What was that?
203,KATE,Mom.
203,DEAN,"All right, everybody stay calm. She's a ghost. She can't come in the circle."
203,KATE,I thought you said ghosts couldn't cross the circle.
203,DEAN,They can't. She's not a ghost.
203,TED,Shoot her! Shoot her!
203,DEAN,"Yeah, about that... Go, go, go! Move!"
203,SAM,Hey!
203,BRIAN,Hey. You okay?
203,DEAN,Where is everybody?
203,BRIAN,Hiding.
203,DEAN,"All right, go get them. Go. Go get them."
203,DEAN,"So, it's not a ghost."
203,SAM,"So, it's just a girl?"
203,DEAN,"It's not just a girl. It's psycho Nell. I'm telling you, man—humans."
203,SAM,"So who is she, then?"
203,DEAN,"I don't know. Maybe it's the daughter, Rebecca. Maybe she didn't hang herself."
203,SAM,"Dude, no. She'd have to be like fifty years old by now."
203,DEAN,"Well, I don't know. What'd you find in the attic?"
203,SAM,Some old junk. I found Rebecca's diary. That's about it.
203,DEAN,"I wish you'd found a howitzer. Listen, we got to get this family safe. I mean, it's just a human, so they can make a run for it. We just got to hold her off."
203,SUSAN,We're okay.
203,BRIAN,Danny! Ted! We got to go!
203,TED,I'm good!
203,SUSAN,Danny! Come on!
203,BRIAN,"Danny, buddy, we got to go!"
203,TED,Told you it was some crazy bitch.
203,DEAN,"Yes, you did."
203,SAM,"Head to town. We'll take it from here, okay?"
203,SUSAN,"Danny, come on, baby! We're leaving!"
203,BRIAN,"Danny, we got to go!"
203,SUSAN,"Brian, where—Where is he?"
203,BRIAN,Danny!
203,SUSAN,Danny!
203,BRIAN,"Suse, Suse, Suse. We will find Danny, I promise you."
203,SUSAN,No.
203,BRIAN,"No. Take Kate and go now. Now, while you still have a chance."
203,SUSAN,Not without Danny.
203,BRIAN,We will find him.
203,KATE,I am not going out there with Mom alone.
203,DEAN,"She's right. Until we find your son, the safest place for you right now is in the shed."
203,KATE,I am not going in there either.
203,DEAN,"Yes, you are. It is the best defense. The windows are boarded up. It's got one door. It's our best shot right now. Trust me."
203,BRIAN,Suse. Kate. Go. Go.
203,SAM,"All right, you and me will take the outside. You two take the house. Let's go."
203,TED,What are you doing?
203,DEAN,She's human. She had to come from somewhere.
203,TED,You smell that?
203,DEAN,Every day.
203,DEAN,Come on.
203,TED,You're not going down there.
203,DEAN,"Well, do you want to?"
203,DEAN,Please nobody grab my leg. Please nobody grab my leg.
203,DEAN,Dog. It's what's for dinner. Danny?
203,TED,Find anything?
203,DEAN,"Yeah, her kitchen."
203,TED,Her what?
203,BRIAN,"Look, why are we just standing here? Let's go in. Let's check the house."
203,SAM,"We have to wait for those guys to get back, okay?"
203,DEAN,"Sam, it's me."
203,SAM,Help me out.
203,SUSAN,Did you get Danny?
203,DEAN,No.
203,SUSAN,"No? Well, where's Ted?"
203,DEAN,He's outside.
203,SUSAN,"Well, why doesn't he come inside?"
203,DEAN,Because I had to carry him out. I'm sorry.
203,SUSAN,"You're...what does that mean? What does that mean, you're sorry?"
203,BRIAN,Are you saying that he's dead?
203,SUSAN,"No. No, he's not saying that he's dead. You're not saying that, are you?"
203,DEAN,We were in the walls and she attacked.
203,SUSAN,Oh my god.
203,DEAN,And I couldn't get to him in time.
203,KATE,Uncle Ted is dead?
203,DEAN,I shouldn't have left him alone. I'm very sorry.
203,BRIAN,"We'll find him, Suse. We will."
203,SUSAN,"Where else is there to look? Danny's dead, isn't he?"
203,BRIAN,"No, Suse."
203,SUSAN,He is. Why not? She killed my brother. Now she killed my son.
203,BRIAN,"No, Danny is alive."
203,SUSAN,"No, no, he isn't."
203,BRIAN,"Yes, he is. Do you remember what he said about the girl who lived in the walls? She said he could stay."
203,SUSAN,"No. No. I just don't understand why this happens to us. I mean, we're good people. We're a good family."
203,BRIAN,"What happened to Andy happened, okay? I cannot change that. But I will find Danny, I promise you. And when I do, we are gonna be fine. You and me, the kids, we're gonna be fine."
203,SUSAN,Okay.
203,DEAN,Andy your son?
203,BRIAN,Oldest. He got himself killed in a car accident last year.
203,DEAN,I'm sorry.
203,BRIAN,"It nearly tore Suse and I apart. Still could, I imagine. That's why we moved here. Fresh air, fresh start. Not even my line. Marriage counselor. 'Course, she might be right. After all, what could possibly go wrong in the country?"
203,DEAN,I'm getting your son back. If it's the last godforsaken thing I do.
203,BRIAN,Why do you care so much?
203,SAM,Dean.
203,SAM,We gotta talk.
203,DEAN,What is that?
203,SAM,Rebecca's diary. I just finished reading it.
203,DEAN,And?
203,SAM,That girl back there? Pretty sure she was Rebecca's daughter.
203,DEAN,Rebecca had a kid?
203,SAM,"It's all she talks about. Being pregnant, being ashamed of being pregnant."
203,SAM,Maybe because her dad called her a dirty little whore and said he was gonna lock the baby up.
203,DEAN,Why would he say that?
203,DEAN,"Oh, gross."
203,SAM,Yeah.
203,DEAN,So the daddy was the babydaddy too?
203,SAM,"Dude was a monster, Dean."
203,DEAN,"Wow, a story ripped from an Austrian headline. Humans, man. So she's been locked up her whole life?"
203,SAM,You saw her eyes. Has she ever seen light? She's barely human.
203,DEAN,"Okay, so, what, then, she's been caged up like an animal and she busts out and ganks dear old Dad? Slash Granddad?"
203,SAM,I guess.
203,DEAN,"Well, can't say I blame her."
203,SAM,"I'm sure her life was hell, Dean. It doesn't mean she gets a free pass for murder."
203,DEAN,Like you know what hell's like.
203,SAM,I didn't...
203,DEAN,Forget it.
203,SAM,So where do we find her?
203,DEAN,"Kid's gotta eat, right?"
203,SAM,What?
203,DEAN,"He kept her hidden, locked up, but he had to feed her, didn't he?"
203,SAM,I guess.
203,DEAN,I think I know where.
203,SAM,"Could've kept her hidden here for years. Kept her fed, nobody would ever know."
203,BRIAN,Danny! Danny!
203,DEAN,"Watch out, I'm going down."
203,BRIAN,No. That's my son.
203,DEAN,"I know it is, but I said that I would get him. I will. Let me."
203,SAM,"Hey, you got curtains? We need rope."
203,SUSAN,It's okay. Shh. It's okay.
203,DEAN,Bitch is a klepto.
203,DEAN,Come on. Danny. Danny.
203,DEAN,Danny?
203,DEAN,"Your dad's upstairs. Come on. Watch your head, watch your head."
203,DANNY,"Hurry, he's coming back."
203,DEAN,He?
203,DANNY,Her brother.
203,KATE,Oh my god!
203,SAM,Danny!
203,DANNY,Okay!
203,SAM,Pull.
203,BRIAN,"Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy. Don't look back, Danny. Just come on, come."
203,KATE,Mom.
203,KATE,Mom!
203,BRIAN,Come on. You okay? It's okay.
203,SAM,Get him out of here. You gotta go.
203,SAM,Dean?
203,KATE,"Mom! Come on, Mom!"
203,BRIAN,Suse!
203,DEAN,Thanks for the head start.
203,BRIAN,Why doesn't it surprise me you guys don't like the police?
203,SAM,"It's sort of a mutual-appreciation thing, really."
203,BRIAN,"Well, thank you."
203,SUSAN,Thank you.
203,DEAN,You okay?
203,SUSAN,"No, we're the opposite of okay, but we're together."
203,SUSAN,Thanks.
203,SAM,You okay?
203,DEAN,"You know, I felt for those sons of bitches back there. Lifelong torture turns you into something like that."
203,SAM,"You were in hell, Dean. Look, maybe you did what you did there, but you're not them. They were barely human."
203,DEAN,"Yeah, you're right. I wasn't like them. I was worse. They were animals, Sam, defending territory. Me? I did it for the sheer pleasure."
203,SAM,What?
203,DEAN,"I enjoyed it, Sam. They took me off the rack, and I tortured souls, and I liked it. All those years, all that pain. Finally getting to deal some out yourself. I didn't care who they put in front of me. Because that pain I felt, it just slipped away. No matter how many people I save, I can't change that. I can't fill this hole. Not ever."
204,DEMON,Tell me about those months without your brother.
204,DEAN,Why do you trust her so much?
204,SAM,She saved my life.
204,ALASTAIR,"You don't have the juice to take me on, Sam."
204,RUBY,Your abilities—you're getting flabby.
204,SAM,"Yeah, so how do I tone up?"
204,RUBY,You know what you got to do.
204,SAM,"No, I'm not doing that anymore."
204,RUBY,Sam...
204,SAM,I said no.
204,JAY,Charlier cut.
204,BARTENDER,Wow. You're really good.
204,VANCE,"Yeah, great. Hey, show us another."
204,ASSISTANT,"Finish your drink, Vance."
204,JAY,This is a simple riffle shuffle.
204,BARTENDER,Do a card trick for me.
204,JAY,"All right, young lady, would you please tell me when to stop?"
204,BARTENDER,Stop.
204,JAY,"This is your card. Commit it to memory, hm?"
204,VANCE,"That's incredible, Jay."
204,ASSISTANT,Don't be a jerk.
204,JAY,"Right, now..."
204,JAY,Do you see your card?
204,BARTENDER,"Um...no, I don't."
204,JAY,"No, the cards say no."
204,VANCE,Check his pocket.
204,VANCE,"Oh, just check—check the damn pocket!"
204,JAY,"So, if you then would remove—"
204,VANCE,This your card?
204,BARTENDER,Why are you so mean? Can't you just leave the old guy alone?
204,CHARLIE,Is he wearing eyeliner?
204,VERNON,Can't tell. I'm blinded by all the sterling silver.
204,JEB,The light has to find me!
204,JEB,"Get it? It, it has to find me!"
204,HELPER,Let's take it back.
204,JAY,Would you guys give it a rest? You're giving me a headache.
204,VERNON,"Oh, come on, Jay. His misdirect is shaking his ass like an Eighth Avenue hooker."
204,CHARLIE,Used to be about skill.
204,JAY,"Yeah, used to be. Used to be. Listen to the two of you. It's pathetic. Bitter old men talking about the glory days. You know what? This douchebag isn't the joke. We are."
204,JAY,"Me, for one."
204,JAY,"You know, maybe he is a douchebag—"
204,JAY,But he's playing the main stage and we can't even afford an assistant. What the hell are we doing?
204,CHARLIE,We're doing all right.
204,JAY,"No, we're not. We're sad, we're old, and we're dying."
204,JAY,I'm gonna do the Table of Death tonight.
204,VERNON,"No. No, you're not, Jay. Don't be crazy."
204,CHARLIE,"You almost killed yourself the last time you tried it, and that was thirty years ago!"
204,JAY,"Oh, who cares if it kills me? At least I'll go out with a headline."
204,JAY,"Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to see is not a trick or an illusion—simply a display of daring and dexterity."
204,JAY,"Now, young lady, if you'll please check the bindings, you'll see they're very real. Very tight."
204,JAY,Thank you. You may take your seat.
204,CHARLIE,Damn straight they're tight. You sure you can slip them?
204,JEB,"This, this isn't a trick, okay? I, I, I don't do tricks. This is a demonstration—"
204,JEB,—about demons and angels—
204,JEB,—love and lust—
204,DEAN,What a douchebag.
204,JEB,—all that stuff mixed up in my head.
204,SAM,That's Jeb Dexter.
204,DEAN,I don't even want to know how you know that.
204,SAM,"He's famous, kind of."
204,JEB,"—but whatever happens, no matter how—"
204,DEAN,For what? Douchebaggery?
204,JEB,"—messed up it gets, don't touch me, okay?"
204,JEB,For your own safety.
204,JEB,"Go back to hell, demon!"
204,DEAN,You've got to be kidding me. A fake demon possession?
204,SAM,It's not all crap.
204,DEAN,What part of that was not—
204,DEAN,—a steaming pile of BS?
204,SAM,"Okay, that was crap, but that's not all magicians."
204,SAM,It takes skill.
204,DEAN,"Oh, right, right, I forgot. You were actually into this stuff, weren't you?"
204,DEAN,"Just—it bugs me. You know, playing at demons and, and magic, when the real thing will kill you bloody."
204,SAM,Like a guy who drops dead of ten stab wounds—
204,SAM,—without a single tear in his shirt?
204,DEAN,That's what I'm talking about.
204,DEAN,So did your boss have any enemies that you know of?
204,ASSISTANT,Vance had plenty of enemies.
204,ASSISTANT,He would steal from other magicians. All the time.
204,SAM,What would he steal?
204,ASSISTANT,"Stage effects, closeup techniques, anything he could get his hands on."
204,DEAN,Is that enough to get him killed?
204,ASSISTANT,These guys take this stuff pretty seriously.
204,ASSISTANT,There you are.
204,DEAN,"Did you find anything weird in Vance's stuff? Well, weirder?"
204,ASSISTANT,"Matter of fact, I did."
204,ASSISTANT,He hated card tricks. Never wanted them around. Let alone in his precious cape.
204,CHARLIE,You gonna tell me how you did it?
204,JAY,Did what?
204,CHARLIE,You know what.
204,JAY,The great ones never give away the how.
204,CHARLIE,"Yesterday you were sad, old, and dying. Today you're one of the great ones? Come on. This is me you're talking to."
204,JAY,You didn't think I could do it.
204,CHARLIE,"No, Jay, I didn't. You're my friend, my best friend. I just didn't want to see you get hurt."
204,JAY,"Charlie, you want to see something? Look at this."
204,CHARLIE,Not bad.
204,JAY,"'Not bad'? I've been working to pull an ace out of the middle of the deck for years, just one, and now I can pull three."
204,CHARLIE,Still missing the ace of hearts.
204,JAY,I want to do the Executioner tonight.
204,CHARLIE,Houdini wouldn't try the Executioner.
204,JAY,"Exactly. Think about it, Charlie. If I can pull this off..."
204,CHARLIE,I think you're pushing your luck.
204,JAY,"It wasn't luck. It wasn't. Here, stand over there."
204,JAY,Does it?
204,CHARLIE,I would do anything for you. You know that. But I will not watch you die. I'll miss that show.
204,JAY,"No, you'll be there. You're always there for me. Check your pocket."
204,JAY,"I can do it, Charlie. I want to do it."
204,JEB,"It's a lame gig. I'm in a fleabag hotel doing this man-of-the-people crap, and freaking Angel's in Vegas doing Cirque du Soleil! That should have been mine."
204,DEAN,Looking into the death of Patrick Vance.
204,JAY,Jay.
204,JAY,My name is Jay.
204,VERNON,What a douchebag.
204,DEAN,"Couldn't agree more. Is, uh—"
204,DEAN,This familiar to you?
204,VERNON,Should it be?
204,VERNON,My act?
204,VERNON,"That was a long time ago. I haven't touched a deck in years, you know..."
204,DEAN,Do you know someone that might use them now?
204,VERNON,"Well, there was a guy down on Bleeker Street."
204,CHARLIE,"Oh, yeah. He, he peddles that kind of specialty stuff."
204,DEAN,Did he have a problem with Vance?
204,VERNON,"Matter of fact, Vance crossed him about a year ago. Probably cost him fifty grand in royalties."
204,DEAN,You know the exact address?
204,VERNON,Four twenty-six Bleeker.
204,CHARLIE,Ask for Chief.
204,DEAN,"I'm, uh, here to see Chief."
204,CHIEF,"You are really gonna get it tonight, big boy."
204,RUBY,I should be asking you the same thing.
204,SAM,I'm working a job.
204,RUBY,"The whole world's about to be engulfed in hellfire, and you're in Magictown, USA."
204,SAM,You got something against magic?
204,SAM,And that someone is me?
204,RUBY,"Well, you can quit dicking around here, for one. Bigger fish, Sam. And if the seals are being broken, you might want to go after the one doing the breaking."
204,SAM,Lilith?
204,RUBY,"Cut the head off the snake. You're the only one who can stop her, Sam. So step up and kill the little bitch."
204,SAM,"Oh, I'm game, believe me. It's not the psychic thing I got a problem with."
204,RUBY,"Yeah, I know what you got a problem with, but tough. It's the only way."
204,SAM,No.
204,SAM,You don't know what you're talking about.
204,RUBY,"Oh I don't, huh? Fine."
204,RUBY,"It's simple. Lucifer rises, the apocalypse starts. You think that you have demons on your hands now? People are gonna die, Sam. Oceans of people. So you just let me know when you're ready."
204,DEAN,Find anything interesting?
204,SAM,"What? Uh, no. You?"
204,DEAN,"Nothing I want to talk about, or think about, ever again."
204,VERNON,"He's crazy, and you know it."
204,VERNON,Did you even try to talk him out of it?
204,CHARLIE,"Till I was blue in the face. But I tell you, Vernon, there was...there was something in his eyes."
204,VERNON,'In his eyes'? You're both nuts.
204,DEAN,"The Chief, huh?"
204,CHARLIE,What's the matter? Chief not your type?
204,DEAN,"You know, I could have you both arrested for obstruction of justice."
204,VERNON,How? You're no Fed.
204,CHARLIE,"We con people for a living, son. Takes more than a fake badge to get past us."
204,DEAN,"You got us. Yeah, we—we are actually—aspiring magicians."
207,BOBBY,"Sam, Dean, Pamela Barnes. Best damn psychic in the state."
207,ALASTAIR,Don't you recognize me? But we were so close.
207,DEAN,Alastair.
207,ANNA,Lucifer—
207,DEAN,"Well, I don't know when it happened, but the Sam I knew—"
207,DEAN,The secrets.
207,DEAN,What else aren't you telling me?
207,SAM,You're holding me back.
207,SAM,—go near.
207,SAM,"You know I didn't mean the things I said back there, right? That it was just the siren's spell talking?"
207,DEAN,Of course. Me too.
207,SAM,"So, we're good?"
207,DEAN,"Yeah, we're good."
207,JIM,"Okay, okay, now, come on, you tell me—now why kick that field goal?"
207,PETE,Because it's called football.
207,JIM,"No, it's called fantasy football, and those three points screwed me."
207,PETE,"Seriously, Jim, you need to get a life."
207,JIM,"Sorry, pal."
207,PETE,No problem.
207,JIM,"Take it easy, all right?"
207,JIM,"Hold on, man."
207,PETE,Jim!
207,PETE,Jim! Jim!
207,PETE,Call 911! Now!
207,PETE,Come on.
207,JIM,Hey.
207,PETE,"Don't move. Don't move, man."
207,JIM,I feel okay.
207,PETE,You're not even bleeding.
207,JIM,Give me a hand.
207,PETE,How you even alive right now?
207,JIM,I don't know.
207,SAM,"No, no, no, you're right, it's definitely weird. ...Okay, Bobby, thanks."
207,DEAN,What's up?
207,SAM,Bobby found something in Wyoming.
207,DEAN,A job?
207,SAM,Maybe.
207,SAM,"Small town, no one's died in the past week and a half."
207,DEAN,That so unusual?
207,SAM,"Well, it's how they're not dying."
207,SAM,One guy with terminal cancer strolls right out of hospice.
207,SAM,Another guy gets capped by a mugger and walks away without a scratch.
207,DEAN,Capped in the ass?
207,SAM,Police say Mr. Jenkins was shot in the heart at point-blank range by a nine-millimeter.
207,DEAN,And he's not a doughnut?
207,SAM,Locals are saying it's a miracle.
207,DEAN,Okay.
207,SAM,"It's got to be something nasty, right? I mean, people making deals or something."
207,DEAN,You think?
207,SAM,What else would it be?
207,DEAN,I don't know.
207,SAM,All right.
207,SAM,Get that to go.
207,SAM,Come on.
207,SAM,What?
207,DEAN,Sure you want me going with you?
207,SAM,Why wouldn't I?
207,DEAN,I don't want to be holding you back or nothing.
207,SAM,"Dude, I've told you a hundred times, that was the siren talking, not me."
207,SAM,Can we get past this?
207,DEAN,"Yeah, we're past it."
207,SAM,"Yes, sir. Floored by the Lord dot com."
207,DEAN,All of God's glory fit to blog.
207,SAM,Um. Some of the people around town are saying what happened to you was a miracle.
207,JIM,It was. Plain as day.
207,SAM,How can you be so sure?
207,JIM,How else do you explain it? The doctors can't.
207,JIM,"There's a bullet in my heart, and it's pumping like a piston."
207,DEAN,"Well, how do you explain it?"
207,JIM,"Look, honestly."
207,JIM,"I was nobody's saint—not exactly father of the year, either."
207,DEAN,Okay.
207,JIM,But when that guy shot me and I didn't bleed a drop? I just knew the Lord was giving me a second chance.
207,DEAN,That so?
207,JIM,I had this feeling—like angels were watching over me.
207,JIM,I wouldn't expect you guys to understand.
207,DEAN,"Well, we'll just have to try."
207,SAM,You wouldn't have happened to have swung by a crossroads in the past week or so?
207,SAM,Maybe you met someone? With black eyes? Or red?
207,JIM,Who'd you guys say you were again?
207,DEAN,Never mind. Thank you for your time.
207,SAM,Hey.
207,DEAN,Anything?
207,SAM,"That cancer survivor? He was clinically dead, his wife pulled the plug, and now he's taking her out for their twentieth anniversary."
207,DEAN,Any sign of a deal?
207,SAM,No. What about you? Found anyone dying around here?
207,DEAN,Not since Cole Griffith.
207,DEAN,He dropped ten days ago. It was the last death I could find.
207,SAM,"So, what are you thinking?"
207,DEAN,"Eh, maybe it is what the people say it is."
207,SAM,"Miracles? Dean, our experience, when do miracles just happen?"
207,DEAN,"Well, there's no deals. There's, uh, no skeevy faith healers."
207,DEAN,"I mean, these souls just ain't getting dragged into the light."
207,SAM,Maybe 'cause there's no one around to carry them.
207,DEAN,What do you mean?
207,SAM,"Well, grim reapers—that's what they do, right? Schlep souls? So, if death ain't in town—"
207,DEAN,"Then nobody's dying. So what? The local reaper's on strike? Playing the back nine? I don't know, Sam."
207,SAM,"Well, then, let's talk to somebody who might."
207,DEAN,"Well, last I checked, huggy bear ain't available."
207,SAM,"No, dude, the kid."
207,DEAN,The kid? The kid's a doornail.
207,SAM,"Exactly. Look, if he was the last person to die around here, then maybe he's seen something. We should talk to him."
207,DEAN,I love how matter-of-fact you are about that. Strange lives.
207,DEAN,You sure this is gonna work?
207,SAM,"No. But if his spirit's around, this should smoke him out."
207,SAM,What?
207,DEAN,"This job is jacked, that's what."
207,SAM,How so?
207,DEAN,"You want me to gank a monster or torch a corpse, hey, let's light it up, right? But this? If we fix whatever this is,  people are gonna start dropping dead. Good people."
207,SAM,"Look, I don't want them to die, either, Dean, but there's a natural order."
207,DEAN,"You're kidding, right?"
207,SAM,What?
207,SAM,"Yeah, but the normal rules don't really apply to us, do they?"
207,DEAN,We're no different than anybody else.
207,SAM,I'm infected with demon blood. You've been to hell.
207,SAM,"Look, I know you want to think of yourself as Joe the Plumber, Dean, but you're not. Neither am I. The sooner you accept that, the better off you're gonna be."
207,DEAN,"Ah, Joe the Plumber was a douche."
207,SAM,You gonna help me finish this?
207,MAN,Hey!
207,MAN,What are you doing here?
207,SAM,Uh—
207,SAM,Just take it easy.
207,MAN,What the hell is this?
207,DEAN,"Okay, this—this—this is not what it looks like."
207,MAN,Really? 'Cause it looks like devil worship.
207,DEAN,"What? No! No, this is not devil worship. This—This is—this—this is, uh—"
207,DEAN,I don't have a good answer.
207,SAM,We're leaving.
207,MAN,You're not going anywhere.
207,MAN,Ever again. Sam.
207,DEAN,Alastair.
207,DEAN,"I thought you got deep fried, extra-crispy."
207,ALASTAIR,Nah. Just the pediatrician I was riding. His wife's still looking for him. It's hilarious. Anyway.
207,ALASTAIR,No time to chat. Got a hot date with death.
207,SAM,Dean!
207,ALASTAIR,"You're stronger, Sam. You've been soloflexing with your little slut?"
207,SAM,You have no idea.
207,SAM,How you doing?
207,DEAN,"I'm in pain, that's how I'm doing. I think I have a concussion."
207,SAM,You want some aspirin?
207,DEAN,"No thanks, House. So, demons, huh?"
207,SAM,Yeah. So much for miracles.
207,DEAN,And what the hell happened with Alastair again?
207,SAM,"I told you, he tried to fling me or whatever."
207,SAM,"And it didn't work, so he bailed."
207,DEAN,"Well, how come he couldn't fling you? He chucked you pretty good last time."
207,SAM,Got no idea.
207,DEAN,"Sam, do me a favor. If you're gonna keep your little secrets, I can't really stop you, but just don't treat me like an idiot, okay?"
207,SAM,"What? Dean, I'm not keeping secrets."
207,DEAN,"Mm-hm. Whatever. So, did you go back and q-and-a the dead kid?"
207,SAM,Didn't have to. Bobby called. He did some digging.
207,DEAN,And?
207,SAM,He thinks I'm right. Local reaper's gone. Not just gone—kidnapped.
207,DEAN,By demons? Why?
207,SAM,Listen to this.
207,SAM,"""And he bloodied death under the newborn sky—sweet to taste, but bitter when once devoured."""
207,DEAN,Swanky. What the hell's that mean?
207,SAM,"Well, it's from a very obscure, very arcane version of Revelations."
207,DEAN,Which means what I think it means?
207,SAM,"Basically, you kill a reaper under the solstice moon—tomorrow night, by the way—you got yourself a broken seal."
207,DEAN,How do you ice a reaper? You can't kill death.
207,SAM,I don't know. Maybe demons can. Where the hell are the angels is what I want to know. We could use their help for once.
207,DEAN,It looks like we're gonna have to take care of this one ourselves.
207,SAM,"What are we gonna do, just swing in and save the friendly neighborhood reaper?"
207,DEAN,"You got a better idea, I'm all ears."
207,SAM,"Dean, reapers are invisible. The only people that can see them are the dead and the dying."
207,DEAN,"Well, if ghosts are the only ones that can see them..."
207,SAM,Yeah?
207,DEAN,Then we become ghosts.
207,SAM,You do have a concussion.
207,DEAN,"Sounds crazy, I know."
207,SAM,It is crazy.
207,SAM,How?
207,PAMELA,I can't even begin to tell you how crazy you two are.
207,SAM,"Well, Pamela, you're a sight for sore eyes."
207,PAMELA,"Aw, that's sweet, grumpy."
207,PAMELA,What do you say to deaf people?
207,PAMELA,Which one of you brainiacs came up with astral projection?
207,DEAN,Yo.
207,PAMELA,Of course. Chachi.
207,PAMELA,"So, let's be clear. You want to rip your souls out of your bodies and take a little stroll through the spirit world?"
207,DEAN,Mm-hm.
207,PAMELA,Do you have any idea how heavy-duty insane that is?
207,DEAN,"Maybe, but that's where the reaper is, so..."
207,PAMELA,"So, it's nuts."
207,DEAN,Not if you know what you're doing.
207,PAMELA,You don't know what you're doing.
207,DEAN,"No, but you do."
207,PAMELA,"Yeah, I do. And guess what? I'm sick of being hauled back into your angel-demon, Soc-Greaser crap."
207,DEAN,"Look, I'd love to be kicking back with a cold one, watching Judge Judy, too."
207,PAMELA,Nice. More blind jokes?
207,DEAN,"You know what I mean. We're talking the end of the world here, okay? No more tasseled leather pants, no more Ramones CDs, no more nothing."
207,DEAN,We need your help.
207,PAMELA,"Tell me something, geniuses. Even if you do break into the veil and you find the reaper, how you gonna save it?"
207,DEAN,With style and class.
207,PAMELA,"You're gonna be two walking pieces of fog who can't touch or move anything. You'll be defenseless, hotshot."
207,SAM,I seem to recall a bunch of ghosts beating the crap out of us.
207,PAMELA,"Yeah, well, they had plenty of time to practice."
207,DEAN,"Well, then, I guess we got to start cramming."
207,PAMELA,"Wow, couple of heroes. All right."
207,PAMELA,Lie down. Close your eyes.
207,PAMELA,"Animum vult decipi, ergo decipiatur. Vis, vis, vis. Okay, guys. That's it. Showtime."
207,DEAN,"Well, nothing like shooting blanks. What's plan B?"
207,DEAN,"Oh, I'm so feeling up Demi Moore."
207,PAMELA,"All right, so, I'm assuming you're somewhere over the rainbow. Remember I have to bring you back."
207,PAMELA,I'll whisper the incantation in your ear.
207,PAMELA,You have got a great ass.
207,DEAN,What'd she—
207,DEAN,What'd she say?
207,DEAN,That was wild.
207,DEAN,Am I making you uncomfortable?
207,SAM,Get out of me.
207,DEAN,You're such a prude. Come on.
207,DEAN,"Oh, man, we've been spooking this town for hours. No demons, no black smoke. I say we hit Victoria's Secret and get our peep on, huh?"
207,SAM,Hey. Three o'clock. Kid in the window.
207,SAM,Am I crazy or is he looking at us?
207,DEAN,It's 'cause we've seen him before.
207,SAM,We have?
207,DEAN,"Newspaper. Cole Griffith, the last person to die in this town."
207,DEAN,Stop! How are you doing that?
207,COLE,Who are you?
207,SAM,"Relax, Cole. It's okay."
207,COLE,How do you know my name?
207,SAM,"Look, this isn't gonna be easy to hear, but...you're—dead. You're a spirit. Us too."
207,COLE,"Yeah, thanks, Haley Joel. I know I'm dead. What do you want?"
207,SAM,We just want to talk.
207,COLE,About what?
207,COLE,I was outside all morning.
207,COLE,They tell you to be careful when it's cold.
207,DEAN,Cold air can cause an asthma attack?
207,COLE,"But then I was in my room. It happened so fast. I called out for my mom, but nothing came out. Everything started spinning, and then I was just standing there, looking down at my body."
207,SAM,And that's when you saw the man?
207,COLE,"Creepy old guy in a black suit. He wanted me to go with him, but..."
207,COLE,I didn't want to go.
207,SAM,Reaper.
207,SAM,How'd you get rid of him?
207,COLE,I didn't. The black smoke did.
207,DEAN,Black smoke?
207,COLE,"It was everywhere. I hid in the closet, and when I came out, it was gone, and so was he."
207,DEAN,Do you know where the smoke went?
207,COLE,No. But I know where it is.
207,COLE,They're back.
207,DEAN,Who?
207,SAM,Another reaper.
207,DEAN,Hey! Hey! Wait! We need to talk to you!
207,TESSA,Dean.
207,DEAN,Do I know you?
207,TESSA,We go way back.
207,TESSA,You don't remember me?
207,DEAN,"Honestly, if I had a nickel for every time I heard a girl say that... You're gonna have to freshen my memory."
207,DEAN,Tessa.
207,TESSA,"That's one of my names, yeah."
207,SAM,"So, you do know her."
207,DEAN,From the hospital after the accident.
207,SAM,The accident with Dad?
207,SAM,"So, this is the reaper that came after you."
207,DEAN,Yeah.
207,TESSA,"Well, this was fun."
207,TESSA,"Now, if you'll excuse me—"
207,DEAN,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, you can't—you can't take the kid."
207,TESSA,Why?
207,DEAN,"Demons are in town, that's why. They've already snatched your reaper pal. The kid knows where."
207,TESSA,So?
207,SAM,"So, you should shag ass. For all we know, they could try and snatch you, too."
207,TESSA,Except that this town is off the rails.
207,TESSA,And someone has to set it straight.
207,DEAN,"Yeah, we understand that, but these are special circumstances."
207,TESSA,What? Your whole angel-demon dance-off? I could care less. I just want to do my job.
207,SAM,"Right, yeah, and, look, we want to help you do your job. So, if you would just bail town—"
207,TESSA,No.
207,DEAN,"Well, then, could you hold off until we fix this? Please."
207,TESSA,"All right, but just so we're clear, when I start reaping again, I'm starting with the kid."
207,SAM,Understood. I'll find him.
207,DEAN,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. What—"
207,DEAN,What are you gonna say to him?
207,SAM,Whatever I have to.
207,SAM,"This all must be pretty overwhelming, huh? Pretty scary, too."
207,COLE,The worst is my mom.
207,SAM,Must be hard seeing her like this.
207,SAM,"She's always coming in here, talking to me, telling me how sad she is. I knock some stuff over to let her know I'm here, but...she only gets sadder."
207,SAM,"Well, you might want to ease up on the flying soccer balls."
207,COLE,I'm not telling you where the smoke is.
207,SAM,"Hey. What if I told you that if you helped me, you wouldn't have to leave here? Ever?"
207,COLE,What about the one downstairs?
207,SAM,"Tessa? Oh, she wouldn't bother you. No reaper would. You could just stay here with your family for as long as you wanted."
207,COLE,You can do that?
207,SAM,"Yeah, you bet I can do that."
207,COLE,You swear?
207,SAM,I swear.
207,TESSA,"I'll tell you, life is funny."
207,DEAN,What do you mean?
207,TESSA,"You and me, together again."
207,DEAN,Are you—are you making a move on me?
207,TESSA,"You're the one that got away, Dean. You'd be surprised how little that happens to me."
207,DEAN,Can I tell you something between you and me?
207,TESSA,Who am I gonna tell?
207,DEAN,"After our little, uh, experience...for that whole year, I felt like I had this...hole in my gut...like I was missing something. I didn't know what. Do you know what it was?"
207,DEAN,It was you. The pain of losing my father and Sammy. I just...I wish I had gone with you for good. But I guess things are different now.
207,TESSA,What? The angels on your shoulder?
207,DEAN,"So, you know about that, huh? Well, hey, don't get me wrong. I mean, most the ones I've met are dicks with wings. But still... You know, I've done things. Horrible things. And someone upstairs still decided to give me a second chance. It just makes me feel...I don't know."
207,TESSA,Uh-huh.
207,SAM,"Hey, guys."
207,TESSA,"Hey, Cole. I'm Tessa. I'm not going to hurt you."
207,SAM,"It's okay, Cole. Just tell them what you told me."
207,COLE,I saw the black smoke at my funeral.
207,DEAN,At the cemetery?
207,COLE,At the funeral home. It was everywhere.
207,DEAN,You doing that?
207,TESSA,No.
207,DEAN,Tessa!
207,SAM,"Cole, you okay?"
207,DEAN,"Well, how the hell are we supposed to fight that?"
207,SAM,I don't know. Learn some ghost moves?
207,DEAN,"By tonight? Yeah, sure. I'll meet you back at Mr. Miyagi's."
207,COLE,Who's Mr. Miyagi?
207,COLE,It's not gonna move if you don't concentrate.
207,DEAN,I am concentrating.
207,DEAN,"Ah, here we go, baby."
207,COLE,You pull a muscle?
207,DEAN,"All right, Yoda, let's see what you got."
207,DEAN,Dude! You are so Amityville.
207,COLE,This isn't even the good stuff.
207,COLE,"See? If you want to hit something, you just got to get mad."
207,SAM,"Yeah, got it."
207,COLE,Now you try. Hit me.
207,DEAN,"Uh, I think I'll stick to just picking on somebody my own size."
207,COLE,Hit me as hard as you can.
207,SAM,"Dude, I'm not gonna do Fight Club with a twelve-year-old."
207,SAM,"All right, cut it out."
207,COLE,Make me.
207,DEAN,"Whoa. Whoa, you got to teach us that."
207,SAM,Maybe it's demon invisible ink. Only see it in the veil.
207,DEAN,Any idea what it's for?
207,SAM,We'll find out.
207,DEAN,"Dude, check me out."
207,DEAN,"You know, this ghost thing, it's, it's kind of rad."
207,SAM,It's iron.
207,DEMON,Boys. Find the place okay?
207,ALASTAIR,"Rock salt's not so much fun anymore, is it?"
207,DEAN,Alastair. You bastard.
207,ALASTAIR,"Well, go on. Why don't you try some of your mojo on me now, hotshot?"
207,ALASTAIR,"It's hard to get it up when you're not wearing your meat, huh?"
207,SAM,Go to hell.
207,ALASTAIR,"Ah, if only I could."
207,ALASTAIR,But they just keep sending me back up to this arctic craphole.
207,DEAN,To kill death?
207,ALASTAIR,"No, to kill death twice. It takes two to break a seal. I figured another one would show up, though. They're like lemmings."
207,ALASTAIR,"By the way, it's, uh, good to see you again, Dean."
207,DEAN,"You can shoot us all you want, but you can't kill us."
207,ALASTAIR,"Ah, that so?"
207,ALASTAIR,Anyhoo...
207,ALASTAIR,"Moon's in the right spot. The board is set. Let's get started, shall we?"
207,DEAN,"You're gonna kill a reaper with that? It's little on the nose, don't you think?"
207,ALASTAIR,"Is it? An old friend lent it to me. You know, he doesn't really ride a pale horse? But he does have three amigos."
207,ALASTAIR,And they're just jonesing for the apocalypse.
207,ALASTAIR,It pays to have friends in low places.
207,ALASTAIR,Don't you think?
207,ALASTAIR,"Hic cruor messorius, illud sigillum, quod luciferem reverendum obstringit, aperiat ut resurgat!"
207,TESSA,Stop!
207,ALASTAIR,Hic cruor messorius—
207,PAMELA,"I know you're here. What's the matter, you reeking son of a bitch? You afraid of a skirt?"
207,PAMELA,"Vis, vis, vis!"
207,PAMELA,Son of a bitch!
207,ALASTAIR,"—illud sigillum, quod luciferem reverendum obstringit—"
207,ALASTAIR,—aperiat ut—
207,ALASTAIR,—resurgat!
207,DEAN,Bye-bye.
207,TESSA,Where's your brother?
207,DEAN,I'll go find him. You get out of here.
207,PAMELA,"Animum vult decipi, ergo—"
207,SAM,Pamela!
207,SAM,What's so funny?
207,PAMELA,I can't die—not in this town.
207,SAM,Pamela—
207,PAMELA,"Quit your worrying, grumpy. How about you make me a drink, huh?"
207,SAM,You need a doctor.
207,PAMELA,"Make me a drink, Sam."
207,ALASTAIR,You can't run.
207,ALASTAIR,Dean.
207,ALASTAIR,Not from me. I'm inside that angsty little noggin of yours.
207,DEAN,What the hell?
207,CASTIEL,Guess again.
207,CASTIEL,"What just happened? You and Sam just saved a seal. We captured Alastair. Dean, this was a victory."
207,DEAN,"Well, no thanks to you."
207,CASTIEL,What makes you say that?
207,DEAN,You were here the whole time?
207,CASTIEL,Enough of it.
207,DEAN,"Well, thanks for your help with the rock salt."
207,CASTIEL,That script on the funeral home—we couldn't penetrate it.
207,DEAN,That was angel-proofing.
207,CASTIEL,Why do you think I recruited you and Sam in the first place?
207,DEAN,You recruited us?
207,CASTIEL,"That wasn't your friend Bobby who called, Dean. It wasn't Bobby who told Sam about the seal."
207,DEAN,That was you?
207,DEAN,"If you want our help, why the hell didn't you just ask?"
207,CASTIEL,"Because whatever I ask, you seem to do the exact opposite."
207,DEAN,"So, what now, huh? The people in this town, they just gonna start dying again?"
207,CASTIEL,Yes.
207,DEAN,"These are good people. What, you think you can make a few exceptions?"
207,CASTIEL,To everything there is a season.
207,DEAN,You made an exception for me.
207,CASTIEL,You're different.
207,TESSA,Dean? I could use your help.
207,TESSA,"Hey, Cole."
207,COLE,Tell your brother thanks for nothing.
207,TESSA,"Look at her, Cole."
207,TESSA,Do you see how unhappy she is?
207,COLE,That's why I want to stay with her.
207,TESSA,"As long as she can feel you, she'll be in pain, because she can't let go."
207,TESSA,Because you won't let go of her.
207,COLE,Why won't anybody tell me what's on the other side?
207,TESSA,Maybe nobody wants to ruin the surprise.
207,COLE,That's not an answer.
207,DEAN,"She won't answer you, Cole. Reapers never do. But trust me. Staying here is a whole lot worse than anything over there."
207,COLE,Why?
207,DEAN,"Because one day, your family will be gone, and there'll be nothing left here for you. It's okay to be scared."
207,COLE,I'm not scared.
207,DEAN,We're all scared. That's the big secret. We're all scared.
207,COLE,Are you coming?
207,DEAN,"Oh, I'm sure I'll be there sooner than you think."
207,DEAN,Look out for that boy.
207,TESSA,"Look out for yourself, Dean."
207,DEAN,What do you mean?
207,TESSA,"I've been around death from the get-go. You know what I see most? Lies. ""He's in a better place."" ""At least they're together now."" You all lie to yourselves, Dean, 'cause like you said, deep down, you're all scared. Stop lying to yourself, Dean."
207,DEAN,What?
207,TESSA,"The angels have something good in store for you. A second chance. Really? 'Cause I'm pretty sure, deep down, you know something nasty's coming down the road. Trust your instincts, Dean. There's no such thing as miracles."
207,DEAN,What are you saying?
207,PAMELA,"Imum vult decipi, ergo decipiatur. Vis, vis, vis."
207,SAM,"Hey, we just got to talk to Tessa, that's all. Get her to hold off reaping till we get you better."
207,PAMELA,I'm pretty sure she's started up again.
207,DEAN,What happened?
207,SAM,"Dean, where's Tessa?"
207,DEAN,She's...
207,SAM,"Pamela, I'm so sorry."
207,PAMELA,Stop.
207,SAM,You don't deserve this.
207,PAMELA,"Yeah, I don't. I told you I didn't want anything to do with this. Do me a favor? Tell that bastard Bobby Singer—to go to hell for ever introducing me to you two in the first place."
207,DEAN,"Take it easy, Pamela. If it's any consolation, you're going to a better place."
207,PAMELA,You're lying.
207,PAMELA,"But what the hell, right? Everybody's got to go sometime."
207,PAMELA,Come here.
207,PAMELA,"I know what you did to that demon, Sam."
207,PAMELA,"I can feel what's inside of you. If you think you have good intentions, think again."
207,SAM,Pamela?
207,DEAN,Pamela!
207,DEAN,What did she say to you?
209,RADIO,NPR Morning Edition. It's time for this waste and—
209,DEAN,"Net profitability aside, it's the client-retention rate that concerns me vis-à-vis maximizing return on sales. Buzz me back once you've seen the spreadsheets."
209,DEAN,Mr. Adler.
209,ADLER,Dean.
209,ADLER,Good stuff.
209,DEAN,Good stuff?
209,ADLER,Big things. Good stuff.
209,DEAN,Good stuff.
209,DEAN,"Oh I hear you. No, I haven't been to the gym in ages. Carrying a little bloat around myself. It's a sedentary lifestyle, my man, no two ways. —All right, tell me one more time. You said lemon and—what was it? Cayenne and maple syrup, are you serious? How much did you lose?"
209,SAM,Do I know you?
209,DEAN,I don't think so.
209,SAM,"I'm sorry, man, you just look really familiar."
209,DEAN,"Save it for the health club, pal."
209,SAM,"Tech support, this is Sam Wesson. Okay. Uh, well, did you try turning it off and then on?"
209,SAM,"Okay, go ahead and turn it off. No no no, just, just off. All right, give it a second. Turn it back on. Okay, is it printing now? Great. Anytime."
209,MAN,Hey.
209,SAM,Yo.
209,MAN,What do you think of Mimi?
209,SAM,She's okay.
209,MAN,Might have to hit that.
209,SAM,"Oh, dude, that's totally age-inappropriate."
209,MAN,Experience.
209,SAM,Trifocals.
209,MAN,"There's a MILF there, Sam. I just know it. Maybe a GMILF."
209,SAM,Come on.
209,MAN,Coffee break?
209,SAM,"Yeah, for sure."
209,MAN,"Paul. Time for a refuel, buddy."
209,PAUL,"Sorry, no time."
209,MAN,"Since when? Dude, we get paid by the hour."
209,PAUL,Working.
209,MAN,Okay.
209,SAM,He seems stressed.
209,MAN,Freaked because he got busted surfing porn on the Internet.
209,SAM,"No, no, no way. When?"
209,MAN,Got sent up to HR yesterday. Guess they put the fear of God in him.
209,SAM,"Ian, dude."
209,IAN,Just doing a little shopping. Running low at home.
209,IAN,"So, Sam, had any of those dreams lately?"
209,IAN,What? Don't be like that. Come on. It's the highlight of my day.
209,SAM,I never should have told you in the first place.
209,IAN,"They're genius. Don't hold out on me, dude. Share with the class."
209,SAM,You're just gonna be a dick about it.
209,IAN,What? No way. I won't say a word. Total respect. Go.
209,IAN,"Classic! How much D&D did you play when you were a kid? Oh, my—okay, so you—rescuing the Grim Reaper. That's—you're a hero. I mean, thank God we got Harry Potter here to save us all from the apocalypse."
209,SAM,Dick.
209,IAN,Wizard.
209,SAM,Can I ask you a question?
209,DEAN,"Look, man, I told you, I'm not into the, uh—"
209,SAM,"Oh dude, come on, I'm not either. I just wanna ask you one question."
209,DEAN,Sure.
209,SAM,What do you think about ghosts?
209,DEAN,Ghosts?
209,SAM,Do you believe in them?
209,DEAN,"Uh, tell you the truth, I've never given it much thought."
209,SAM,Vampires?
209,DEAN,What? Why?
209,SAM,Because I've been having some weird dreams lately. You know what I mean?
209,DEAN,No. Not really.
209,SAM,So you've never had any...weird dreams?
209,DEAN,"All right, look, man, I don't know you, okay? But I'm gonna do a public service and, uh, let you know that—that you overshare."
209,SAM,"Did you turn it off, then on?"
209,SAM,"All right, well, let's try that. No, no, it's fine, I'll wait."
209,SAM,"Is it printing now? Oh, that's great. Anytime."
209,IAN,Whatcha doing?
209,SAM,Nothing.
209,IAN,You get an email from Human Resources?
209,SAM,No. Why?
209,IAN,"Damn it. Guess it's just me, then. I'm supposed to, quote, report to HR, unquote."
209,SAM,They're probably finally busting you for snaking all those office supplies.
209,IAN,I hope they spank me.
209,PAUL,No no no no no no. Come on. Don't do this to me. Please.
209,SAM,"Hey, man, you okay?"
209,PAUL,It froze.
209,SAM,"They're crap, Paul. They freeze all the time."
209,PAUL,"You don't understand. When I, when I rebooted, everything was gone. A whole day's work deleted."
209,SAM,"Well, did you back up?"
209,PAUL,"No, I didn't back up. I wish to God I backed up but I didn't. I'll get it back. I'll find it. It's somewhere. I'll find it."
209,SAM,"Paul, it's okay, man. These things happen."
209,PAUL,Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Please. Please.
209,PAUL,All that work. Gone. Failed.
209,DEAN,Something about this seem not right to you?
209,SUIT,"Uh, yeah, try the whole thing. I'm telling you, man, I'll never eat popcorn again."
209,DEAN,"Yeah, right."
209,DEAN,Two weeks?
209,SAM,"Hey. Why would someone kill themselves two weeks before they were supposed to retire? I mean, Paul was two weeks from freedom. He should have been happy, right?"
209,IAN,"I don't have time for this, Sam."
209,SAM,That's very funny.
209,SAM,What's with you?
209,IAN,I'm working. It's important.
209,SAM,HR bust your balls or something? You're wearing the shirt. Did you shave?
209,IAN,"Tech support, this is Ian. Be right up. Gotta go up to twenty-two, speak to a manager."
209,DEAN,"Hi. Ian, is it? Yeah, come on in. Yesterday you filled out a 445-T and no problem, just a few errors when we did your switch over to Vista. So I'm sure you're used to filling out the dash-R's, am I right?"
209,IAN,"Oh, no."
209,DEAN,No no no. It's fine. It's fine. I just need you to redo one today so I can get the show on the road with the invoicing.
209,IAN,Oh my god.
209,DEAN,"No, it's fine. Just refile it and we're square."
209,IAN,I can't believe I did this.
209,IAN,I can't believe I—I can't believe I did this.
209,DEAN,"Hey, guy, come on."
209,IAN,"No, no. It affected profits. It—I screwed up. I—I can't—I can't—I am so sorry. I—how could I do that? I failed Sandover. I failed the company."
209,DEAN,"All right, why don't you sit down, Ian?"
209,IAN,No.
209,DEAN,Ian? Ian. Hey.
209,DEAN,"Ian, hey. Just chill out, man. Okay?"
209,DEAN,"Ian, hey, maybe we should get out of here, huh? Come on. Ian. Look at me."
209,DEAN,Somebody help me!
209,DEAN,"No, I, I followed him into the bathroom."
209,DEAN,"He was, uh—he was standing there in front of the mirror, and then—"
209,OFFICER,Continue. Sir.
209,DEAN,"And he stabbed himself in the neck. I'm sorry, that's, um..."
209,SAM,"Tech support, this is Sam."
209,DEAN,I need to see you in my office. Now.
209,DEAN,Come on in. Shut the door.
209,DEAN,Who the hell are you?
209,SAM,I'm not sure I know.
209,DEAN,What the hell does that mean?
209,SAM,Sam Wesson. I started here three weeks ago.
209,DEAN,All right. You cornered me in the elevator talking about ghosts. And now...
209,SAM,Now what?
209,DEAN,"Now nothing. I, uh...so you started working here three weeks ago, huh?"
209,DEAN,"Yeah, me too."
209,DEAN,It's the Master Cleanse. You tried it? Phenomenal. Detoxes you like nobody's business.
209,SAM,"When you were in that bathroom with Ian, did you see something?"
209,DEAN,I don't know. I don't know what I saw.
209,SAM,Wait. Are you saying that—did you see a ghost?
209,DEAN,I was freaking out. The guy penciled his damn neck.
209,SAM,"You did, didn't you? Okay, listen. What if these suicides aren't suicides? I mean, what if they're something not natural?"
209,DEAN,"So, what, ghosts are real? And they're responsible for all the dead bodies around here? Is that what you're telling me?"
209,SAM,I know it sounds crazy. But yes. That's what I'm telling you.
209,DEAN,Uh-huh. Based on what?
209,SAM,Instinct.
209,DEAN,I've got the same instinct.
209,SAM,Seriously? You know those dreams I was telling you about? I was dreaming about ghosts.
209,DEAN,Yeah.
209,SAM,And then it turns out that there's a real ghost.
209,DEAN,So you're telling me that your dreams are special visions and you're some kind of psychic?
209,SAM,"No. I mean, that would be nuts. I'm just saying something weird is definitely going on around here, right? So I've been digging around a little."
209,SAM,I think I found a connection between the two guys.
209,DEAN,You broke into their email accounts?
209,SAM,I used some skills that I happen to have to satisfy my curiosity.
209,DEAN,Nice.
209,SAM,"Yeah. Okay. So it turns out Ian and Paul both got this same email telling them to report to HR, room fourteen forty-four."
209,DEAN,HR's on seven.
209,SAM,Exactly.
209,DEAN,Should we go check this out?
209,SAM,Like right now?
209,DEAN,"No. No, it's getting late. You're right."
209,SAM,I am dying to check this out right now.
209,DEAN,Right?
209,MAN,Hello? Hello?
209,DEAN,Whoa.
209,SAM,How'd you know how to do that?
209,DEAN,I have no idea.
209,DEAN,"Holy crap, dude."
209,SAM,Yeah. I could use a beer.
209,DEAN,"Oh, sorry, man. I'm on the Cleanse. I got rid of all the carbs in the house."
209,SAM,Hey. How the hell did you know that ghosts are scared of wrenches?
209,DEAN,"Crazy, right? And nice job kicking that door too. That was very Jet Li. What are you, like a black belt or something?"
209,SAM,No. I have no clue how I did that. It's like...we've done this before.
209,DEAN,"What do you mean, before? Like Shirley MacLaine before?"
209,SAM,No. I—I just can't shake this feeling like I—like I don't belong here. You know? Like I should do something more than sit in a cubicle.
209,DEAN,I think most people who work in a cubicle feel that same way.
209,SAM,"No. Well, look, it's more than that. Like, I don't like my job. I don't like this town. I don't like my clothes. I don't like my own last name. I don't know how else to explain it, except that...it feels like I should be doing something else. There's just something in my blood. Like I was destined for something different. What about you? You ever feel that way?"
209,DEAN,"I don't believe in destiny. I do believe in dealing with what's right in front of us, though."
209,SAM,"All right, so, what do we do now?"
209,DEAN,"We do what I do best, Sammy. Research."
209,SAM,Okay. Did you just call me Sammy?
209,DEAN,Did I?
209,SAM,I think you did. Yeah. Don't.
209,DEAN,Sorry.
209,DEAN,"Oh, jackpot."
209,SAM,What you got?
209,DEAN,"I just found the best site ever. Real, actual ghost hunters."
209,DEAN,These guys are genius. Check it out.
209,SAM,Instructional videos.
209,ED,We know why you're watching.
209,HARRY,You've got a problem.
209,ED,A ghost problem.
209,HARRY,A ghost-related problem. A ghost—it's like a ghost-adjacent pr—it's like a problem that's—and the ghost is—
209,ED,"Whatever. You've come to the right place. The only decent place, really, because the Ghostfacers know how to solve it."
209,HARRY,Period.
209,ED,Watch and learn.
209,HARRY,"See, the first step in any supernatural fight:"
209,DEAN,That's him. That's the ghost.
209,SAM,"P. T. Sandover. Died 1916. Devoted his life to his work. No wife, no kids."
209,SAM,"Used to say he was the company, and his very blood pumped through the building."
209,DEAN,"Wow, okay. So slight workaholic. Maybe he's still here, you know, watching over the company, even killing for it."
209,SAM,"Plus, turns out this isn't the first time people started killing themselves in the building. 1929."
209,DEAN,"Yeah, but lots of guys jumped off lots of high rises that year."
209,SAM,How many companies had seventeen suicides?
209,DEAN,"Phew. Okay, so P. T. Sandover, protector of the company. His ghost wakes up and becomes active during times of grave economic distress."
209,SAM,"Well, I mean, the worst time we've seen since the Great Depression—"
209,DEAN,"Is now. Yeah, now sucks. My portfolio's in the sewer. I don't even wanna talk about it."
209,SAM,So Sandover's helping the bottom line—
209,DEAN,By zapping some model employees.
209,SAM,"Yeah. I mean, Ian and Paul. It was like he turned them into different people."
209,DEAN,"Perfect worker bees, exactly. So devoted to the company that they would commit hara-kiri if they failed it."
209,SAM,"One more interesting fact. The building wasn't always that high. Used to be fourteen floors. And the room where the ghost attacked, fourteen forty-four? Once upon a time, that was the old man's office."
209,HARRY,Once you've got that thing in your sights—
209,HARRY,Using special ghost-hunting weapons.
209,ED,"First, salt. It's like acid to ghosts."
209,HARRY,Burny acid.
209,ED,Not LSD.
209,HARRY,"No. It's a bad trip for ghosts. Next up, iron."
209,SAM,That's why the wrench worked.
209,ED,Pure power in your hand.
209,HARRY,Dissipates ghosts instantly.
209,ED,Next little trick. We learned this from those useless douchebags—
209,HARRY,That we hate.
209,ED,The Winchesters.
209,HARRY,Gun.
209,ED,Shotgun shell. Pack it up with fresh rock salt.
209,HARRY,Very effective.
209,ED,Very effective.
209,HARRY,"Winchesters still suck ass, though."
209,ED,Affirmative. Suckage major.
209,DEAN,Where do we even get a gun?
209,SAM,Gun store?
209,DEAN,Isn't there like some kind of waiting period or something?
209,SAM,I think so.
209,DEAN,"Well, how in the hell—"
209,SAM,"I don't know. Seems pretty impossible, honestly."
209,DEAN,Right.
209,ED,The aforementioned super-annoying Winchester douchenozzles also taught us this one other thing. You have to burn the remains.
209,HARRY,"Okay, this next part gets a little gross. Sometimes you might have to dig up the body. Sorry."
209,ED,It's illegal in some states.
209,HARRY,All states.
209,ED,Possibly all states.
209,SAM,Sandover was cremated.
209,DEAN,What? So what do we do now?
209,HARRY,"Now, if the deceased has been cremated—"
209,ED,Don't panic.
209,HARRY,Don't panic.
209,ED,Just gotta look for some other remains.
209,HARRY,"A hair in a locket, maybe. Fingernails. Baby teeth."
209,ED,Milk teeth.
209,HARRY,Genetic material. You know what we're talking about.
209,ED,Go find it.
209,HARRY,"Fight well, young lions."
209,ED,Godspeed.
209,DEAN,Set your cell phone to walkie-talkie in case we get separated.
209,SAM,How the hell are we gonna find some ancient speck of DNA in a skyscraper?
209,DEAN,"Well, that creepy storeroom used to be Sandover's office, right?"
209,GUARD,What the hell are you doing here?
209,SAM,Nothing. I just—
209,GUARD,Come with me.
209,SAM,"Man, listen. Look. It's okay. I—I work here."
209,GUARD,Whatever. Tell it to the cops.
209,GUARD,"Well, come on."
209,SAM,What?
209,GUARD,"Last time this happened, it took them two hours to get here."
209,SAM,Let's just wait.
209,SAM,"Seriously, I'll wait."
209,GUARD,"Look, I don't have the rest of my life."
209,SAM,Call you back.
209,SAM,"Dean, you there?"
209,DEAN,"Yeah, listen, I think I got it. Meet me on twenty-two."
209,SAM,"Okay, yeah. Just, uh, take the stairs."
209,DEAN,Whoa. That's a lot of blood.
209,SAM,"Yeah, I know."
209,DEAN,"Right. So, uh, in there."
209,SAM,P. T. Sandover's gloves.
209,DEAN,"Yeah, how much you wanna bet there's a little smidge of DNA in there? You know, like a fingernail clipping or a hair or two? Something."
209,SAM,So you ready?
209,DEAN,I have no idea.
209,SAM,Me neither.
209,SAM,Go for it.
209,DEAN,Right.
209,DEAN,Oh. Nice.
209,SAM,Dean.
209,SAM,Nice catch.
209,DEAN,Right?
209,SAM,That was amazing.
209,DEAN,Right? Right?
209,DEAN,"Man, I gotta tell you, I've never had so much fun in my life."
209,SAM,Me neither.
209,DEAN,"Was a hell of a workout too, wasn't it?"
209,SAM,We should keep doing this.
209,DEAN,I know.
209,SAM,I mean it. There gotta be other ghosts out there. We could help a lot of people.
209,DEAN,"Right, we'd be like the Ghostfacers."
209,SAM,"No, really. I mean, for real."
209,DEAN,"What? Like, quit our jobs and hit the road?"
209,SAM,Exactly.
209,DEAN,How would we live?
209,SAM,Uh...
209,DEAN,You gotta be kidding me. How would we get by? With stolen credit cards? Huh? Eating diner food drenched in saturated fats? Sharing a crap motel room every night?
209,SAM,That's all just details.
209,DEAN,Details are everything. You don't wanna go fighting ghosts without any health insurance.
209,SAM,All right. Um. Confession.
209,DEAN,What?
209,SAM,Remember those dreams I told you about with the ghosts?
209,DEAN,Yeah?
209,SAM,I was fighting them.
209,DEAN,Okay.
209,SAM,"With you. We were these, like, hunters, and we were friends. More like brothers, really. I mean, what if that's who we really are? I mean, you saw us back there, working together. The ghost was scrambling people's brains. What if it scrambled ours?"
209,DEAN,That's insane.
209,SAM,"Is it? Think about it for just one second. What if we think this is our life, but it's not?"
209,DEAN,"Hey, man, the ghost is dead and we're still standing. I mean, I'm sorry, but—"
209,SAM,"Look, all I know is this isn't who we're supposed to be."
209,DEAN,"No. I'm Dean Smith, okay? Director of Sales and Marketing. I went to Stanford. My father's name is Bob, my mother's name is Ellen, and my sister's name is Jo."
209,SAM,When was the last time you talked to them? To any of them?
209,DEAN,"Okay, you're upset. You're upset, you're confused—"
209,SAM,"Yeah, 'cause I only moved here 'cause I just broke up with my fiancée, Madison. But I called her number and I got a damn animal hospital."
209,DEAN,Okay. What are you saying? Are you trying to say that my family isn't real? Huh? That we've been injected with fake memories? Come on.
209,SAM,"All I know is, I got this feeling in my gut. And I know—I know that deep down, you gotta be feeling it too. We're supposed to be something else. You're not just some corporate douchebag. This isn't you. I know you."
209,DEAN,"Know me? You don't know me, pal. You should go."
209,SAM,I quit.
209,ADLER,Got a minute?
209,DEAN,"Sure, of course."
209,ADLER,"How are you feeling, Dean?"
209,DEAN,"Uh, great."
209,ADLER,"You look a little tired. Been working hard, I gather."
209,DEAN,Yeah.
209,ADLER,"Ah, don't be modest. I hear everything. And I'm pleased with what I'm hearing."
209,ADLER,That's why it's important to me that you're happy.
209,ADLER,How's that for a bonus?
209,DEAN,That's very generous.
209,ADLER,Purely selfish. Wanna make sure you're not going anywhere.
209,DEAN,Wow. Are you sure?
209,ADLER,"Positive. You are Sandover material, son. Real go-getter. Carving your own way."
209,DEAN,"Well, thanks. I try."
209,ADLER,"I see big things in your future. Maybe even senior VP, Eastern Great Lakes Division. Don't get me wrong, you'll have to work for it. Seven days a week, lunch at your desk, but in eight to ten short years, that could be you."
209,DEAN,"Uh, well, thank you. Thank you, sir. It's, um...but..."
209,DEAN,I am giving my notice.
209,ADLER,"This is a joke. You're kidding me, right?"
209,DEAN,"No. I've—I recently—uh, very recently realized that I have some other work I have to do. It's, uh, very important to me."
209,ADLER,Other work? Another company?
209,DEAN,"No, I—it's hard to explain. Um. It's just that this—this is—it's just—it's not who I'm supposed to be."
209,DEAN,What?
209,ADLER,"Dean, Dean, Dean. Finally."
209,DEAN,"What the hell? Why am I wearing a tie? My God, am I hungry."
209,ADLER,Welcome back.
209,DEAN,"Wait. Did I—did I just get touched by—you're an angel, aren't you?"
209,ADLER,I'm Zachariah.
209,DEAN,"Oh, great. That's all I need is another one of you guys."
209,ZACHARIAH,"I'm hardly another one, Dean. I'm Castiel's superior. Believe me, I had no interest in popping down here into one of these smelly things."
209,ZACHARIAH,"But after the unfortunate situation with Uriel, I felt it necessary to pay a visit. Get my ducks in a row."
209,DEAN,I am not one of your ducks.
209,ZACHARIAH,Starting with your attitude.
209,DEAN,"Oh, so, what? This was all some sort of a lesson? Is that what you're telling me? Wow. Very creative."
209,ZACHARIAH,You should see my decoupage.
209,DEAN,"Gross. No thank you. So, what? I'm just hallucinating all this? Is that it?"
209,ZACHARIAH,"Not at all. Real place, real haunting. Just plunked you in the middle without the benefit of your memories."
209,DEAN,Just to shake things up? Hm? So you guys can have fun watching us run around like ass clowns in monkey suits?
209,ZACHARIAH,"To prove to you that the path you're on is truly in your blood. You're a hunter. Not because your dad made you, not because God called you back from hell, but because it is what you are. And you love it. You'll find your way to it in the dark every single time and you're miserable without it. Dean, let's be real here. You're good at this. You'll be successful. You will stop it."
209,DEAN,"Stop what? The apocalypse, huh? Lucifer? What? Be specific, man."
209,ZACHARIAH,"You'll do everything you're destined to do. All of it. But I know, I know. You're not strong enough. You're scared. You got daddy issues. You can't do it. Right?"
209,DEAN,"Angel or not, I will stab you in your face."
209,ZACHARIAH,All I'm saying is it's how you look at it. Most folks live and die without moving anything more than the dirt it takes to bury them. You get to change things.
209,ZACHARIAH,"Save people, maybe even the world. All the while you drive a classic car and fornicate with women. This isn't a curse. It's a gift. So for God's sakes, Dean, quit whining about it. Look around. There are plenty of fates worse than yours. So are you with me? You wanna go steam yourself another latte? Or are you ready to stand up and be who you really are?"
211,JOHN,"You left. Your brother and me, we needed you. You walked away, Sam. You walked away!"
211,SAM,"You're the one who said ""don't come back"", Dad. You're the one who closed that door, not me!"
211,JOHN,"Sammy, I just couldn't accept the fact that you and me—we're just different."
211,SAM,We're not different. Not anymore.
211,SAM,"Ruby, it's been weeks. I need it."
211,DEAN,How far from normal? From human?
211,CASTIEL,"Your brother is headed down a dangerous road, Dean."
211,DEAN,"It's already gone too far, Sam. If I didn't know you, I would want to hunt you."
211,KATE,No! Go away!
211,KATE,"Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, god. It's okay. It's okay."
211,SAM,Hey. How'd you sleep?
211,DEAN,How do you think? I'm starving. Let's get breakfast.
211,SAM,Where? We're like two hours from anything.
211,DEAN,But I'm hungry now.
211,SAM,There's probably still a sandwich in the back seat.
211,DEAN,It's tuna.
211,SAM,Isn't that Dad's phone?
211,DEAN,Hello?
211,ADAM,"Uh, is this John?"
211,DEAN,He can't come to the phone. Can I help you?
211,ADAM,No no no—I really—I need to talk to John. This is Adam Milligan. He knows me.
211,DEAN,"Well, sorry to be the one to break this to you, pal, but John died more than two years ago."
211,DEAN,Who is this?
211,ADAM,I'm his son.
211,SAM,"Dean, look, best I can tell, Adam Milligan is real."
211,SAM,"Um, born September twenty-ninth, 1990 to Kate Milligan. No father listed on the birth certificate. He's an Eagle Scout."
211,SAM,"Graduated from high school with honors and currently goes to the University of Wisconsin—biology major, pre-med."
211,SAM,Dean? You listening?
211,DEAN,This is a trap.
211,SAM,"Dean, I'm telling you, the kid checks out."
211,DEAN,"Great, so he's an actual person on the planet Earth. Sucks he's got a demon in him."
211,DENISE,Hi. Welcome to Cousin Oliver's.
211,SAM,Thanks.
211,DENISE,Can I—
211,DEAN,We're actually waiting on somebody.
211,SAM,Thank you—
211,SAM,What are you—
211,SAM,Holy water?
211,DEAN,Yup.
211,DEAN,"One sip of Jesus juice, this evil bitch is gonna be in a world of hurt."
211,SAM,And what if he's not possessed?
211,DEAN,Then he is a shapeshifter.
211,SAM,Hence the silver.
211,DEAN,"Look, either way, this thing is gonna bleed. I mean, using Dad as bait? That's the last mistake of its short, pitiful life."
211,DEAN,What?
211,DEAN,What?
211,SAM,Dean...listen. There's an entry in Dad's journal.
211,SAM,"From January of 1990, saying he's headed to Minnesota to check out a case. That's, roughly, oh, about nine months before the kid was born."
211,DEAN,Coincidence.
211,SAM,Coincidence. Next two pages of the journal—torn out.
211,DEAN,"You're not actually buying this, are you?"
211,SAM,"Look, man, I don't want to believe it either, I'm just saying it's possible."
211,SAM,"I mean, Dad would be gone for weeks at a time, and he wasn't exactly a monk."
211,SAM,"I mean, a hunter rolls into town, kills a monster, saves the girl...sometimes the girl's grateful."
211,DEAN,"Well, now I’m thinking about Dad sex. Stop talking."
211,SAM,Maybe he slipped one past the goalie.
211,DEAN,Dude!
211,SAM,Adam?
211,ADAM,You Sam?
211,SAM,"Yeah. Uh, this is Dean."
211,ADAM,Hey.
211,ADAM,"So, um...how did you know my dad?"
211,SAM,"Uh, we worked together."
211,ADAM,How did he die?
211,SAM,On the job.
211,ADAM,"He was a mechanic, right?"
211,DEAN,A car fell on him.
211,DENISE,"Hey, Adam. How you doing?"
211,DEAN,"Oh, I’ll take that. I am very thirsty."
211,DENISE,"The usual, Adam?"
211,ADAM,"Uh, yeah. Thanks, Denise."
211,SAM,"So, uh, when's the last time you saw John?"
211,ADAM,I don't even know. It's...a couple years.
211,SAM,Why did you decide to call him now?
211,ADAM,I didn't know who else to call. He's the only family I got.
211,ADAM,My mom's missing.
211,SAM,"Really? I'm sorry. Uh, for how long?"
211,DEAN,"It's tragic, really. But if you're John's kid, how come we've never heard of you?"
211,ADAM,"'Cause John and me didn't really know each other. Not until a few years ago, anyway."
211,SAM,What do you mean?
211,ADAM,My mom never talked about him. I knew some stuff.
211,DEAN,What kind of stuff?
211,ADAM,"My mom's a nurse, and Dad came into the ER, pretty torn up. Hunting accident or something. And I knew his name. John Winchester. That's about it. We're not exactly a nuclear family."
211,SAM,"Yeah, well, who is these days?"
211,DEAN,"So, when did you, uh, when did you finally meet him?"
211,ADAM,"When I was twelve. My mom had one of his old numbers, and—"
211,ADAM,"—and after I begged her—God, twenty-four-seven—she finally called him. God, when John heard he had a son, he raced to town. I mean, he dropped everything. He drove all night."
211,DENISE,There you go.
211,ADAM,Thanks.
211,DEAN,"Well, that's heartwarming."
211,ADAM,You mind?
211,DEAN,"Please, dig in."
211,ADAM,He would swing by once a year or so.
211,ADAM,"You know, called when he could. But still..."
211,ADAM,"He taught me poker and pool and even bought me my first beer when I was fifteen. And, uh...he showed me how to drive. Dad, he had this beautiful 'sixty-seven Impala—"
211,DEAN,"Oh, this is crap. You know what, you're lying."
211,ADAM,"No, I’m not."
211,DEAN,"Uh, yeah, you are."
211,ADAM,"I'm sorry, but who the hell are you to call me a liar?"
211,DEAN,"We're John Winchester’s sons, that's who."
211,ADAM,I've got brothers?
211,DEAN,"No, you don't have brothers. Look, man, I don't know if you're a hunter or what kind of game you're playing here."
211,ADAM,I have never been hunting in my life.
211,DEAN,"Whatever. I'm out of here. Come on, Sam."
211,ADAM,I can prove it.
211,DEAN,He took you to a baseball game?
211,ADAM,"Yeah, when I turned fourteen. Dad was around for a few of my birthdays."
211,SAM,"September twenty-ninth, two thousand four. One word. 'Minnesota.'"
211,DEAN,He took you to a freakin' baseball game?
211,ADAM,Yeah. Why? What'd Dad do with you on your birthday?
211,DEAN,Oh...
211,SAM,"Adam, you said you called Dad because your mom was missing."
211,ADAM,Yeah.
211,SAM,How long has she been gone?
211,ADAM,Three days.
211,DEAN,Who was the last person to see her?
211,ADAM,"Mr. Abbinanti, our neighbor. He saw her come home Tuesday night, but she never showed up to work on Wednesday."
211,SAM,Did you call the police?
211,ADAM,Mom's supervisor at the hospital did. And then I drove down here as fast as I could.
211,ADAM,I should have been here.
211,DEAN,"What'd the, uh, what'd the cops say?"
211,ADAM,"That they, uh, they searched the house. They didn't find anything."
211,ADAM,"She wouldn't leave without telling anybody. It's like she just dropped off the face of the earth, you know?"
211,DEAN,"The, uh, nightstand was knocked over. Was there anything else?"
211,ADAM,"Oh, not really. The sheriff said there's no sign of a break-in."
211,ADAM,"What, you think the cops missed something?"
211,DEAN,Maybe. Yeah. They don't have my eyes.
211,ADAM,You're a mechanic.
211,DEAN,Yeah. That's right.
211,ADAM,"Dean, what else can you tell me about Dad?"
211,DEAN,You knew him.
211,ADAM,Not as well as you.
211,DEAN,"Trust me, kid, you don't want to know."
211,DEAN,Give us a minute.
211,DEAN,You talk to the cops?
211,SAM,"Yeah. Like Adam said, no leads on his mom."
211,DEAN,Shocker there.
211,SAM,But I did find this.
211,SAM,"Um...here. In nineteen ninety, there were seventeen grave robberies in Windom."
211,DEAN,You think that's why Dad came through here?
211,SAM,I'd say so. Check it out.
211,DEAN,"All right, so he was hunting something. What?"
211,SAM,"No idea. Those were the pages he threw out of the journal. But last month, the corpse snatching started up again. Three bodies from the local cemetery."
211,DEAN,"So whatever he was after, he didn't kill it. It's back."
211,SAM,"And, what, it's stepped up its game to fresh meat? I mean, Kate's missing, and, uh—"
211,SAM,So is a local bartender—a guy named Joe Barton.
211,DEAN,"Hey, does your mom know Joe Barton?"
211,ADAM,"Uh, I don't think so. Why?"
211,ADAM,What is it?
211,DEAN,Watch out.
211,DEAN,Give me a hand with the mattress.
211,DEAN,Every time.
211,DEAN,Why didn't I pick paper?
211,ADAM,Who the hell are you?
211,SAM,"Adam, hey."
211,SAM,Take it easy.
211,ADAM,"No, don't tell me to take it easy, okay? My house is a crime scene, my mom's probably dead, and you two—well, you tell me to call the cops, but you got to bail before they show? So, who are you really?"
211,ADAM,"Cops didn't know where to look for my mom, Dean, but you did. And I heard you talking earlier—something about grave robberies."
211,ADAM,You're not mechanics. I just want to know what's going on.
211,ADAM,Please.
211,SAM,We're hunters.
211,DEAN,Sammy!
211,SAM,"He deserves to know, Dean."
211,ADAM,"What do you mean, 'hunters'?"
211,ADAM,"Okay, so...basically, you're saying that every movie monster, every nightmare that I’ve ever had, that's all real?"
211,SAM,We hunt them. So did Dad.
211,ADAM,Okay.
211,DEAN,"""Okay""? That's it?"
211,ADAM,What am I supposed to say?
211,DEAN,"That we're liars, that we're crazy. Nobody just says ""okay."""
211,ADAM,"Well, you're my brothers. You're telling me the truth, right?"
211,DEAN,Yeah.
211,ADAM,"Then I believe you. Now, what took my mom?"
211,SAM,"We're not sure. Something's in town stealing bodies, living and dead, but we don't know what."
211,DEAN,There's a long list of freaks that fit the bill.
211,ADAM,You think maybe she might still be alive?
211,ADAM,Oh. How can I help?
211,DEAN,You can't.
211,ADAM,"This thing killed my mom. If you're hunting it, I want in."
211,DEAN,No.
211,SAM,"Dean, look, maybe—"
211,DEAN,Maybe what?
211,SAM,He lost his mother. Maybe we can understand what that feels like.
211,DEAN,"Why do you think Dad never told us about this kid, Sam? Huh? Why do you think he ripped out the pages?"
211,SAM,Because—
211,DEAN,Because he was protecting him!
211,SAM,"Dad's dead, Dean."
211,DEAN,"That doesn't matter! He didn't want Adam to have our lives, okay? And we are gonna respect his wishes."
211,ADAM,Do I get a say in this?
211,DEAN,No!
211,SAM,No.
211,DEAN,Babysit the kid.
211,SAM,Where are you going?
211,DEAN,I'm going out!
211,ADAM,Is he always like that?
211,SAM,Welcome to the family.
211,SAM,Here.
211,SAM,I'm gonna teach you a few things.
211,ADAM,"Uh, Dean said—"
211,SAM,I know what Dean said.
211,SAM,And I know what it's like to want revenge.
211,DIRECTOR,This tomb was built in 1926. Four generations of the Millsap family were interred here.
211,DEAN,They don't build 'em like this anymore.
211,DIRECTOR,"Tell me, Agent Nugent, have you thought about where you might like to spend eternity?"
211,DEAN,All the damn time.
211,DEAN,"So, three bodies went missing. Any idea who did it?"
211,DIRECTOR,"Hooligans. Sick, deranged hooligans."
211,DEAN,This isn't blood. What is this?
211,DIRECTOR,"No, it's embalming fluid. Whoever committed this crime didn't just take the corpses. They opened them up."
211,BARTENDER,First beer's on the house for cops. Feds too.
211,DEAN,Am I that obvious?
211,BARTENDER,I know all the local badges.
211,BARTENDER,"So, what's the FBI doing in Windom?"
211,DEAN,Looking into the disappearance of Joe Barton.
211,DEAN,I assume you knew him?
211,BARTENDER,A little. I'm his wife. Lisa.
211,DEAN,"Well, Lisa, what can you tell me about his disappearance?"
211,LISA,Same thing I told the sheriff. He stayed late Friday before last to do inventory. Never came home.
211,DEAN,And the police?
211,LISA,"Nothing. Truth is, I was scared they stopped looking. But now you're here."
211,DEAN,Joe was a cop?
211,LISA,Deputy. For a little while. That was a looong time ago.
211,DEAN,"He didn't happen to work the, uh, the grave robbery case, back in 'ninety?"
211,LISA,He did. Yeah. Joe was the one who found those bodies. He got an award for that.
211,DEAN,That was an interesting case.
211,DEAN,He ever tell you how he did it?
211,LISA,"Most of the time, he said good, solid police work. But after a few beers, he'd admit he had a little help."
211,DEAN,From who?
211,LISA,A 'specialist'. That's all he'd say.
211,DEAN,Cops ever find the guy that stole the bodies?
211,LISA,No.
211,ADAM,Sam...how did Dad really die?
211,SAM,Demon.
211,ADAM,You hunted it down? Got revenge?
211,SAM,Dean killed it.
211,ADAM,So it's over for you.
211,SAM,It's never over.
211,ADAM,What the—
211,SAM,Shh.
211,SAM,Stay here.
211,SAM,It's in the vents. Go!
211,SAM,Where's your car?
211,ADAM,Over here.
211,SAM,"All right, keys."
211,ADAM,Here.
211,ADAM,Sam!
211,ADAM,"Dean, help!"
211,DEAN,I winged it. Did you see anything?
211,SAM,I didn't get a good look.
211,DEAN,What the hell is this thing?
211,ADAM,Why—who—should we go after it?
211,DEAN,"No, no. In that maze? That thing's long gone."
211,SAM,"All right, so, we don't know what it is, but we do know who it's going after. Joe Barton, Adam's mom—"
211,DEAN,"And Adam. It was under his truck, just waiting for him."
211,SAM,"It set a trap, and I walked right into it."
211,DEAN,"Doesn't matter. You're right—there's a pattern. Joe Barton was a cop. I'm pretty sure he helped out Dad. So we've got him, Dad's girl, and his son."
211,SAM,All the people Dad knew in town.
211,DEAN,At least we know why it's back.
211,ADAM,It wants revenge.
211,DEAN,Grab your stuff. We'll hit the road.
211,SAM,We shouldn't leave.
211,DEAN,"Yeah, let's stay here, where the kid's mom got ganked. Good one."
211,SAM,I'm serious.
211,DEAN,"No, Sam, we're gonna take the kid, we're gonna drop him off at Bobby's, and then you and me are gonna come back here and finish what Dad started."
211,SAM,"How? We got no leads, no witnesses. We do have what this thing wants."
211,DEAN,You want to use the kid as bait? That's why you want to stay here?
211,SAM,Maybe this thing will come back. We could train Adam—get him ready.
211,DEAN,"He could die, Sam."
211,SAM,"We could all die, Dean. Even if we do kill this thing, there are tons of other freaks that want revenge, on Dad, on us. What if they find the kid instead and he's not ready?"
211,ADAM,"I'll do it. Whatever it takes, I’ll do it. I want to do it."
211,ADAM,Whoa.
211,SAM,It's easy. Just feel the recoil and time the trigger pulls. Three taps.
211,ADAM,Yeah?
211,SAM,Go ahead.
211,ADAM,"Beginner's luck, right?"
211,SAM,"Nah, man. You're a natural. Good shooting."
211,ADAM,Thanks.
211,SAM,"So, then we lit it on fire."
211,ADAM,With a homemade flamethrower?
211,SAM,Yeah. They're easy to build. I'll show you.
211,ADAM,"That is some job you got, man."
211,SAM,"Being a hunter isn't a job, Adam. It's life. You're pre-med. You got a girlfriend, friends?"
211,SAM,"Not anymore you don't. If you're really gonna do this, you can't have those kinds of connections, ever. They're weaknesses. You'll just put those people in danger, get them killed."
211,SAM,"That's the price we pay. You cut 'em out, and you don't look back. There's only one thing you can count on. Family."
211,DEAN,Sam.
211,DEAN,Can I talk to you?
211,DEAN,What the hell was that?
211,SAM,What?
211,DEAN,"'Hunting is life. You can't have connections.' Dad gave you that exact same speech, remember? It was just before you ditched us for Stanford. You hated Dad for saying that stuff, and now you're quoting him?"
211,SAM,"Yeah, well, turns out Dad was right."
211,DEAN,Since when?
211,SAM,"Since always. Dean, when I look at Adam, you know what I see?"
211,DEAN,A normal kid.
211,SAM,"No. Meat. Because the demons and monsters out there, that's all he is. I hated Dad for a long time. I did. But now I think I understand. So we didn't have a dog and a white picket fence. So what? Dad did right by us. He taught us how to protect ourselves. Adam deserves the same."
211,DEAN,"Listen to yourself, man."
211,SAM,You think I’m wrong?
211,DEAN,"I think it's too late for us. This is our life. This is who we are, okay? And it's fine. I accept that. But with Adam, he's still got a chance, man. He can go to school. He could be a doctor."
211,SAM,What makes Adam so special?
211,DEAN,"What, are you jealous of the kid?"
211,SAM,Are you?
211,SAM,Dean...all this...it's not real. The dad Adam knew—he wasn't real. The things out there in the shadows—they are real. The world is coming to an end. That's real. Everything else is just part of the crap people tell themselves to get through the day.
211,DEAN,"Dad didn't have a choice with us, okay? But with Adam, he did. Adam doesn't have to be cursed."
211,SAM,He's a Winchester. He's already cursed.
211,DEAN,"No. No, whatever's hunting Adam, I’m gonna find it."
211,SAM,"You already looked everywhere, Dean."
211,DEAN,"Well, then I’ll look again."
211,DEAN,Home sweet home.
211,DEAN,Sloppy Joe.
211,DEAN,"Oh, son of a bitch!"
211,DEAN,Son of a bitch.
211,SAM,"All right. We've closed off every other way into the house. If this thing's coming, it's coming through here."
211,ADAM,You were saying?
211,KATE,Adam! Adam!
211,ADAM,Mom?
211,SAM,No.
211,ADAM,Mom!
211,SAM,Adam!
211,ADAM,Mom.
211,SAM,"Adam, wait!"
211,KATE,"It took me, but I got away."
211,ADAM,It's okay.
211,KATE,I got away.
211,SAM,"Adam, step away from her."
211,ADAM,"Sam, what the hell?!"
211,SAM,She's not your mother!
211,KATE,"Adam, who—what is going on?"
211,SAM,Get away from him!
211,'KATE',What is going on?
211,SAM,You listen to me.
211,ADAM,"It's really her, okay?"
211,SAM,There was too much blood. Your mother's dead. There was too much blood in the vents!
211,'KATE',Adam!
211,SAM,Shoot it!
211,'KATE',"He's crazy! Honey, it's me!"
211,SAM,Look—Adam!
211,'KATE',"Honey, it's me!"
211,SAM,"Look, that's not your mother!"
211,'KATE',"Baby, please!"
211,SAM,Shoot it! It's not human!
211,ADAM,I know.
211,SAM,Silver. No wonder none of the tests worked. You're not shapeshifters. You're ghouls.
211,'KATE',"You know, I find that term racist."
211,'KATE',Mmm. Fresh meat. So much better than what we're used to.
211,SAM,"I should have known. It was the fresh kills that threw me. Ghouls don't usually go after the living. See, you're just filthy scavengers, feeding off the dead—taking the form of the last corpse you choke down."
211,'ADAM',"And their thoughts. And their memories. Like Adam, for instance."
211,'KATE',"Well, we are what we eat."
211,SAM,You're monsters.
211,'ADAM',"You know, you use that word a lot, Sam."
211,'ADAM',But I don't think you know what it means.
211,'KATE',"His blood, it tastes different."
211,'ADAM',"Our father was a monster? Why? Because of what he ate? He never hurt anyone, Sam. Living, anyway."
211,'KATE',No. He was no monster. But the thing that killed him was. A monster named John Winchester.
211,DEAN,Holy crap.
211,'KATE',"Thanks to your daddy, my brother and I grew up on our own. At least we had each other."
211,'ADAM',Like you and your brother. Inseparable.
211,'KATE',"Actually, it was very hard to get you on your own."
211,'ADAM',"Like you said, Sam, the only thing you can count on is family."
211,'KATE',"And for twenty years, we lived like rats."
211,'ADAM',"Graveyard after graveyard, all that stinking flesh."
211,'KATE',"Then we thought, 'hey, why not move up to fresher game?'"
211,'ADAM',And we knew just where to start.
211,'ADAM',"Revenge—it's never over, is it, Sam?"
211,'KATE',"First, it was John's cop friend, and then his slut, and then his son."
211,'ADAM',"Then I called John, but the son of a bitch was already dead."
211,'KATE',So I guess you and Dean will have to do instead.
211,'ADAM',Dean won't interrupt us this time. We're gonna feed on you nice and slow—like we did with Adam.
211,'KATE',"Oh, and, by the way, he really was your brother."
211,'KATE',You should know that.
211,'ADAM',He was still alive when we took our first bites.
211,'KATE',And he was a screamer.
211,'ADAM',"Sam, the more you struggle, the faster you're gonna bleed out."
211,DEAN,Hey!
211,SAM,"Dean, they're ghouls!"
211,DEAN,Which means head-shot.
211,SAM,Dean!
211,DEAN,"Come on. Come on. Come on. Hang on. All right, here we go. Here we go. Hang on, buddy. All right."
211,SAM,Thank you.
211,DEAN,"That's what family's for, right? Keep pressure on that."
211,SAM,You sure we should do this?
211,DEAN,Ghouls didn't fake those pictures. They didn't fake Dad's journal.
211,DEAN,Adam was our brother. He died like a hunter. He deserves to go out like one.
211,SAM,"Maybe we can bring him back. Get a hold of Cas, call in a favor."
211,DEAN,"No, Adam's in a better place."
211,DEAN,"You know, I finally get why you and Dad butted heads so much. You two were practically the same person."
211,DEAN,"I mean, I worshipped the guy, you know? I dressed like him, I acted like him, I listen to the same music. But you were more like him than I will ever be. And I see that now."
211,SAM,I'll take that as a compliment.
211,DEAN,You take it any way you want.
214,DEAN,Who are you?
214,CASTIEL,Castiel. I'm an angel of the Lord.
214,CASTIEL,Because we have work for you.
214,SAM,I wish to God I could stop.
214,DEAN,"Yes, I swear."
214,ZACHARIAH,I'm Zachariah.
214,DEAN,"She's poison, Sam! Look what she did to you!"
214,NUN,"Um, Father?"
214,RUBY,Sam? Your head in the game here?
214,RUBY,You okay?
214,SAM,I just said I was.
214,RUBY,"Look, I know hand-holding really isn’t my thing... but still, Dean was wrong, saying what he said to you."
214,SAM,"No, he was right to say it. I mean, I don't blame him after what I did."
214,RUBY,"Well, after we're done, you guys will patch things up. I mean, you always do."
214,SAM,You're talking like I've got an 'after'.
214,RUBY,Don't say that.
214,SAM,"I can feel it inside me, Ruby. I've changed... for good. And there's no going back now."
214,RUBY,Sam --
214,SAM,"Look, I know what I gotta do. It's okay, I'm just saying, Dean's better off as far away from me as possible. Anyways. Doesn't matter, let's just get this done with."
214,BOBBY,Dean? Dean! You listen to a word I said?
214,DEAN,"Yeah, I heard you. I'm not calling him."
214,BOBBY,"Don't make me get my gun, boy."
214,BOBBY,"I know you're pissed. And I'm not making apologies for what he's done, but he's your--"
214,DEAN,"Blood? He's my blood, is that what you were gonna say?"
214,BOBBY,He's your brother. And he's drowning.
214,DEAN,"Bobby, I tried to help him, I did. Look what happened."
214,BOBBY,So try again.
214,DEAN,It's too late.
214,BOBBY,There's no such thing.
214,BOBBY,You don't mean that.
214,DEAN,"Yes I do, Bobby. Sam's gone. He's gone. I'm not even sure if he's still my brother anymore. If he ever was."
214,BOBBY,"You stupid, stupid son of a bitch! Well, boo hoo, I am so sorry your feelings are hurt, princess! Are you under the impression that family's supposed to make you feel good?! Bake you an apple pie, maybe?  They're supposed to make you miserable! That's why they're family!"
214,DEAN,"I told him, ""you walk out that door, don't come back"" and he walked out anyway! That was his choice!"
214,BOBBY,"You sound like a whiny brat. No, you sound like your dad. Well, let me tell you something. Your dad was a coward."
214,DEAN,"My dad was a lot of things, Bobby, but a coward?"
214,BOBBY,"He'd rather push Sam away than reach out to him. Well, that don't strike me as brave. You are a better man than your daddy ever was. So you do both of us a favor. Don't be him."
214,CASTIEL,"Hello, Dean. It's almost time."
214,SAM,So. We need to talk.
214,ZACHARIAH,"Hello, Dean. You're looking fit."
214,DEAN,I'm not hungry.
214,ZACHARIAH,"No? How about Ginger from season 2 of ""Gilligan's Island""? You do have a thing for her, don't you?"
214,DEAN,Tempting. Weird.
214,ZACHARIAH,We'll throw in Mary Ann for free.
214,DEAN,"No, no. Let's... bail on the holodeck, okay? I want to know what the game plan is."
214,ZACHARIAH,"Let us worry about that. We want you... focused, relaxed."
214,DEAN,"Well, I'm about to be pissed and leaving, so start talking, Chuckles."
214,DEAN,Why?
214,ZACHARIAH,Lilith has to break it. She's the only one who can. Tomorrow night -- midnight.
214,DEAN,Where?
214,ZACHARIAH,We're working on it.
214,DEAN,"Well, work harder."
214,ZACHARIAH,we'll do our job. You just make sure you do yours.
214,ZACHARIAH,All in good time.
214,DEAN,Isn't now a good time?
214,ZACHARIAH,Have faith.
214,DEAN,"What, in you? Give me one good reason why I should."
214,SAM,I don't need one.
214,SAM,Where's Lilith?
214,SAM,"Yeah, you are, actually. And with good reason."
214,SAM,I think what you should be worrying about is what happens before you die.
214,SAM,You'll tell me where she is?
214,SAM,A convent?
214,SAM,And what is the final seal?
214,SAM,Fine.
214,RUBY,Wait. You can't.
214,SAM,Why not?
214,RUBY,"Sorry, sister. You're a walking, talking can of whup-ass."
214,RUBY,I know. Just can't trust anyone these days.
214,RUBY,That so?
214,SAM,What are you talking about?
214,AZAZEL,"Father, look... I'm not exactly the praying type, but still... I made the sacrifice. I got you a bagful of nuns. So, uh... can you hear me? Can you whisper through the door?"
214,AZAZEL,"It's so good to hear your voice, Padre. I have been searching for you for so long. You have no idea. The others have lost faith. Dickless heathens. But not me."
214,LUCIFER,You've done well.
214,AZAZEL,"So, uh... how do I bust you out?"
214,LUCIFER,Lilith.
214,AZAZEL,"Lilith? Father, she's... trapped neck-deep in the pit. It won't be easy."
214,AZAZEL,"Yeah, okay. But what do I do?"
214,LUCIFER,You must find me a child. A very special child.
214,SAM,You got to be kidding me.
214,RUBY,What?
214,RUBY,Yeah?
214,SAM,Azazel.
214,RUBY,"Wow. So, Lilith, Yellow-Eyes -- all the A-listers are paying visits. Certainly gives the joint credibility."
214,SAM,As a place where the final seal goes down.
214,SAM,"Hey, maybe, um... look."
214,RUBY,What?
214,SAM,M-maybe we can find another demon.
214,RUBY,"Sam, no. That blubbery ""don't hurt me"" crap -- it's just an act. She's playing you."
214,SAM,I'm not so sure.
214,RUBY,"Even if she's not, there's still a hell-bitch snoozing in there. I mean, come on. It's not like you haven't done this before, right?"
214,CASTIEL,You asked to see me?
214,CASTIEL,Anything you wish.
214,DEAN,I need you to take me to see Sam.
214,CASTIEL,Why?
214,DEAN,There's something I got to talk to him about.
214,CASTIEL,What's that?
214,CASTIEL,I don't think that's wise.
214,DEAN,"Well, I didn't ask you for your opinion."
214,CASTIEL,Have you forgotten what happened the last time you met?
214,DEAN,"No. That's the whole point. Listen, I'm gonna do whatever you mooks want, okay? I just need to tie up this one thing. Five minutes -- that's all I need."
214,CASTIEL,No.
214,DEAN,"What do you mean, no? Are you saying that I'm trapped here?"
214,CASTIEL,You can go wherever you want.
214,DEAN,Super. I want to go see Sam.
214,CASTIEL,Except there.
214,DEAN,I want to take a walk.
214,CASTIEL,Fine. I'll go with you.
214,DEAN,Alone.
214,CASTIEL,No.
214,DEAN,You know what? Screw this noise. I'm out of here.
214,CASTIEL,Through what door?
214,DEAN,Damn it.
214,RUBY,What are you -- a 12-year-old girl? Just play it already.
214,SAM,Mind your own business.
214,CINDY,"Let me out! Let me out!
(thumping on the roof of the trunk)"
214,SAM,"God, I wish she would just shut up."
214,SAM,Is that supposed to make me feel better?
214,RUBY,"I know that you're having a tough time here, Sam, but we're in the final lap here. Now is not the time to grow a persqueeter."
214,SAM,Would you drop the friggin' attitude? I'm about to bleed and drink an innocent woman. While she watches.
214,RUBY,And save the world as a result.
214,SAM,I don't know. I-I just... I'm starting to think... maybe Dean was right.
214,RUBY,About what?
214,SAM,About everything.
214,RUBY,"We're gonna see this through, right, Sam? Sam?"
214,CINDY,"Let me out! Let me out!
(screaming and thumping on the roof of the trunk)"
214,DEAN,Son of a bitch.
214,DEAN,Let me out of here.
214,ZACHARIAH,Like I told you: too dangerous out there. Demons on the prowl.
214,DEAN,I've been getting my ass kicked all year. Now you're sweating my safety? You're lying. I want to see my brother.
214,ZACHARIAH,That's... ill-advised.
214,DEAN,"You know, I am so sick of your crap riddles and your smug, fat face. What the hell is going on, huh? Why can't I see Sam? And how am I gonna ice Lilith?"
214,DEAN,What?
214,ZACHARIAH,Lilith's going to break the final seal. Fait accompli at this point. Train's left the station.
214,ZACHARIAH,"Nope. Never did. The end is nigh. The apocalypse is coming, kiddo, to a theater near you."
214,DEAN,What was all that crap about saving seals?
214,ZACHARIAH,"Our grunts on the ground -- we couldn't just tell them the whole truth. We'd have a full-scale rebellion on our hands. I mean, think about it. Would we really let 65 seals get broken unless senior management wanted it that way?"
214,DEAN,But why?
214,DEAN,What happens to all the people during your little pissing contest?
214,DEAN,What about Sam? He won't go quietly. He'll stop Lilith.
214,DEAN,What does that mean? What are you gonna do to him?
214,DEAN,Which means?
214,DEAN,Tell me something. Where's God in all this?
214,ZACHARIAH,God? God has left the building.
214,LILITH,Howdy.
214,GUARD,"Lady, this is private property. You're not supposed to be here."
214,LIITH,But I'm here for mass. And so are you.
214,CASTIEL,"You can't reach him, Dean. You're outside your coverage zone."
214,DEAN,What are you gonna do to Sam?
214,CASTIEL,Nothing. He's gonna do it to himself.
214,CASTIEL,"We've been through much together, you and I. And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry it ended like this."
214,CASTIEL,Try to understand -- this is long foretold. This is your...
214,DEAN,"Destiny? Don't give me that ""holy"" crap. Destiny, God's plan... It's all a bunch of lies, you poor, stupid son of a bitch! It's just a way for your bosses to keep me and keep you in line! You know what's real? People, families -- that's real. And you're gonna watch them all burn?"
214,CASTIEL,"What is so worth saving? I see nothing but pain here. I see inside you. I see your guilt, your anger, confusion. In paradise, all is forgiven. You'll be at peace. Even with Sam."
214,CASTIEL,What would you have me do?
214,DEAN,Get me to Sam. We can stop this before it's too late.
214,CASTIEL,"I do that, we will all be hunted. We'll all be killed."
214,CASTIEL,Dean --
214,DEAN,We're done!
214,RUBY,"Sam, it's time. Are we doing this or not?"
214,SAM,Give me a minute to think.
214,RUBY,Sam --
214,SAM,"Give me a damn minute, Ruby!"
214,RUBY,Better think fast.
214,SAM,Do it.
214,ZACHARIAH,Castiel! Would you mind explaining just what the hell you're doing?
214,CASTIEL,He won't be gone long. We have to find Sam now.
214,DEAN,Where is he?
214,CASTIEL,"I don't know. But I know who does. We have to stop him, Dean, from killing Lilith."
214,DEAN,But Lilith's gonna break the final seal.
214,CASTIEL,"Lilith is the final seal. She dies, the end begins."
214,CHUCK,"Oh, yeah? Really? At the same time? Really? Wow. T-that sounds... moist."
214,CHUCK,"Uh, what are your rates?"
214,CHUCK,"Okay. Then, uh, I'll take 20 girls for the whole night."
214,WOMAN,I'm not sure you can afford that.
214,CHUCK,"Lady, sometimes you got to live like there's no tomorrow."
214,CHUCK,Wait. T-t-this isn't supposed to happen.
214,WOMAN,Sir?
214,LILITH,Don't be afraid. We're going to save the world.
214,DEAN,"St. Mary's? What is that, a convent?"
214,CHUCK,"Yeah, but you guys aren't supposed to be there. You're not in this story."
214,CHUCK,"Aw, man! Not again! No!"
214,SAM,I've been waiting for this... for a very long time.
214,LILITH,Then give me your best shot.
214,SAM,Dean?
214,SAM,What the hell?
214,RUBY,I can’t believe it.
214,SAM,"Ruby, what’s going on?"
214,RUBY,"You did it. I mean, it was a little touch-and-go there for a while, but... you did it."
214,SAM,What? What -- what did I do?
214,RUBY,You opened the door. And now he's free at last. He's free at last!
214,SAM,"Oh, my god."
214,RUBY,Guess again.
214,RUBY,"Don't hurt yourself, Sammy. It's useless. You shot your payload on the boss."
214,SAM,The blood... You poisoned me.
214,SAM,Why? W-why me?
214,RUBY,"Because... because it had to be you, Sammy. It always had to be you. You saved us. You set him free. And he's gonna be grateful. He's gonna repay you in ways that you can't even imagine."
214,RUBY,You're too late.
214,DEAN,I don't care.
214,DEAN,"Sammy, let's go."
214,CASTIEL,A pair of what?
214,CHUCK,"No, I mean, why are you helping Dean?"
214,CASTIEL,"It occurred to me, something he always says..."
214,CHUCK,Yeah? What's that?
214,CASTIEL,What the hell?
