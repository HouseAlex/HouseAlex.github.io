1,1,MARY,"Come on, let's say good night to your brother."
1,1,DEAN,"'Night, Sam."
1,1,MARY,"Good night, love."
1,1,MAN,"Hey, Dean."
1,1,DEAN,Daddy!
1,1,JOHN,"Hey, buddy."
1,1,JOHN,So what do you think? You think Sammy's ready to toss around a football yet?
1,1,DEAN,"No, Daddy."
1,1,JOHN,No.
1,1,MARY,You got him?
1,1,JOHN,I got him.
1,1,JOHN,"Sweet dreams, Sam."
1,1,MARY,John?
1,1,MARY turns,she's alone. She gets up.
1,1,MARY,John? Is he hungry?
1,1,MAN,Shhh.
1,1,MARY,All right.
1,1,MARY,Hm.
1,1,MARY,Sammy! Sammy!
1,1,JOHN,Mary?
1,1,JOHN,Mary!
1,1,JOHN,Mary.
1,1,JOHN,"Hey, Sammy. You okay?"
1,1,JOHN,No! Mary!
1,1,DEAN,Daddy!
1,1,JOHN,"Take your brother outside as fast as you can and don't look back! Now, Dean, go!"
1,1,JOHN,Mary!
1,1,JOHN,No!
1,1,DEAN,"It's okay, Sammy."
1,1,JOHN,I gotcha.
1,1,FIREFIGHTER,I got it. You go hold the line up.
1,1,OFFICER,Stay back. You have to stay back.
1,1,YOUNG WOMAN,Sam!
1,1,JESS,"Get a move on, would you?"
1,1,JESS,We were supposed to be there like fifteen minutes ago.
1,1,JESS,Sam!
1,1,JESS,You coming or what?
1,1,SAM,Do I have to?
1,1,JESS,Yes!
1,1,JESS,It'll be fun.
1,1,JESS,And where's your costume?
1,1,SAM,You know how I feel about Halloween.
1,1,JESS,So here's to Sam—
1,1,JESS,—and his awesome LSAT victory.
1,1,SAM,"All right, all right, it's not that big a deal."
1,1,JESS,"Yeah, he acts all humble."
1,1,JESS,But he scored a one seventy-four.
1,1,LUIS,Is that good?
1,1,JESS,Scary good.
1,1,LUIS,So there you go. You are a first-round draft pick. You can go to any law school you want!
1,1,SAM,"Actually, I got an interview here. Monday. If it goes okay I think I got a shot at a full ride next year."
1,1,JESS,Hey. It's gonna go great.
1,1,SAM,It better.
1,1,LUIS,How does it feel to be the golden boy of your family?
1,1,SAM,"Ah, they don't know."
1,1,LUIS,"Oh, no, I would be gloating! Why not?"
1,1,SAM,Because we're not exactly the Bradys.
1,1,LUIS,And I'm not exactly the Huxtables. More shots?
1,1,SAM,No.
1,1,JESS,"No, seriously. I'm proud of you. And you're gonna knock 'em dead on Monday—"
1,1,JESS,—and you're gonna get that full ride. I know it.
1,1,SAM,What would I do without you?
1,1,JESS,Crash and burn.
1,1,MAN,"Whoa, easy, tiger."
1,1,SAM,Dean?
1,1,SAM,You scared the crap out of me!
1,1,DEAN,That's 'cause you're out of practice.
1,1,DEAN,Or not.
1,1,DEAN,Get off of me.
1,1,SAM,What the hell are you doing here?
1,1,DEAN,"Well, I was looking for a beer."
1,1,SAM,What the hell are you doing here?
1,1,DEAN,Okay. All right. We gotta talk.
1,1,SAM,"Uh, the phone?"
1,1,DEAN,"If I'd'a called, would you have picked up?"
1,1,JESS,Sam?
1,1,SAM,"Jess. Hey. Dean, this is my girlfriend, Jessica."
1,1,JESS,"Wait, your brother Dean?"
1,1,DEAN,"Oh, I love the Smurfs. You know, I gotta tell you. You are completely out of my brother's league."
1,1,JESS,Just let me put something on.
1,1,DEAN,"No, no, no, I wouldn't dream of it. Seriously."
1,1,DEAN,"Anyway, I gotta borrow your boyfriend here, talk about some private family business."
1,1,DEAN,"But, uh, nice meeting you."
1,1,SAM,No.
1,1,SAM,"No, whatever you want to say, you can say it in front of her."
1,1,DEAN,Okay.
1,1,DEAN,Um. Dad hasn't been home in a few days.
1,1,SAM,So he's working overtime on a Miller Time shift. He'll stumble back in sooner or later.
1,1,DEAN,Dad's on a hunting trip. And he hasn't been home in a few days.
1,1,SAM,"Jess, excuse us. We have to go outside."
1,1,SAM,"I mean, come on. You can't just break in, middle of the night, and expect me to hit the road with you."
1,1,DEAN,"You're not hearing me, Sammy. Dad's missing. I need you to help me find him."
1,1,SAM,"You remember the poltergeist in Amherst? Or the Devil's Gates in Clifton? He was missing then, too. He's always missing, and he's always fine."
1,1,DEAN,Not for this long. Now are you gonna come with me or not?
1,1,SAM,I'm not.
1,1,DEAN,Why not?
1,1,SAM,I swore I was done hunting. For good.
1,1,DEAN,"Come on. It wasn't easy, but it wasn't that bad."
1,1,SAM,"Yeah? When I told Dad I was scared of the thing in my closet, he gave me a .45."
1,1,DEAN,"Well, what was he supposed to do?"
1,1,SAM,"I was nine years old! He was supposed to say, don't be afraid of the dark."
1,1,DEAN,Don't be afraid of the dark? Are you kidding me? Of course you should be afraid of the dark. You know what's out there.
1,1,SAM,"Yeah, I know, but still. The way we grew up, after Mom was killed, and Dad's obsession to find the thing that killed her."
1,1,DEAN,"We save a lot of people doing it, too."
1,1,SAM,You think Mom would have wanted this for us?
1,1,SAM,"The weapon training, and melting the silver into bullets? Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors."
1,1,DEAN,"So what are you gonna do? You're just gonna live some normal, apple pie life? Is that it?"
1,1,SAM,No. Not normal. Safe.
1,1,DEAN,And that's why you ran away.
1,1,SAM,I was just going to college. It was Dad who said if I was gonna go I should stay gone. And that's what I'm doing.
1,1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, Dad's in real trouble right now. If he's not dead already. I can feel it."
1,1,DEAN,I can't do this alone.
1,1,SAM,Yes you can.
1,1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, I don't want to."
1,1,SAM,What was he hunting?
1,1,DEAN,"All right, let's see, where the hell did I put that thing?"
1,1,SAM,"So when Dad left, why didn't you go with him?"
1,1,DEAN,"I was working my own gig. This, uh, voodoo thing, down in New Orleans."
1,1,SAM,Dad let you go on a hunting trip by yourself?
1,1,DEAN,"I'm twenty-six, dude."
1,1,DEAN,"All right, here we go. So Dad was checking out this two-lane blacktop just outside of Jericho, California. About a month ago, this guy."
1,1,DEAN,"They found his car, but he vanished. Completely MIA."
1,1,SAM,So maybe he was kidnapped.
1,1,DEAN,"Yeah. Well, here's another one in April."
1,1,DEAN,"Another one in December 'oh-four, 'oh-three, 'ninety-eight, 'ninety-two, ten of them over the past twenty years."
1,1,DEAN,"All men, all the same five-mile stretch of road."
1,1,DEAN,"It started happening more and more, so Dad went to go dig around. That was about three weeks ago. I hadn't heard from him since, which is bad enough."
1,1,DEAN,Then I get this voicemail yesterday.
1,1,JOHN,"Dean...something big is starting to happen...I need to try and figure out what's going on. It may... Be very careful, Dean. We're all in danger."
1,1,SAM,You know there's EVP on that?
1,1,DEAN,"Not bad, Sammy. Kinda like riding a bike, isn't it?"
1,1,DEAN,"All right. I slowed the message down, I ran it through a gold wave, took out the hiss, and this is what I got."
1,1,WOMAN,I can never go home...
1,1,SAM,Never go home.
1,1,DEAN,"You know, in almost two years I've never bothered you, never asked you for a thing."
1,1,SAM,All right. I'll go. I'll help you find him.
1,1,SAM,But I have to get back first thing Monday. Just wait here.
1,1,DEAN,What's first thing Monday?
1,1,SAM,I have this...I have an interview.
1,1,DEAN,"What, a job interview? Skip it."
1,1,SAM,"It's a law school interview, and it's my whole future on a plate."
1,1,DEAN,Law school?
1,1,SAM,So we got a deal or not?
1,1,JESS,"Wait, you're taking off?"
1,1,JESS,Is this about your dad? Is he all right?
1,1,SAM,"Yeah. You know, just a little family drama."
1,1,JESS,Your brother said he was on some kind of hunting trip.
1,1,SAM,"Oh, yeah, he's just deer hunting up at the cabin, he's probably got Jim, Jack, and José along with him. I'm just going to go bring him back."
1,1,JESS,What about the interview?
1,1,SAM,I'll make the interview. This is only for a couple days.
1,1,JESS,"Sam, I mean, please."
1,1,JESS,Just stop for a second. You sure you're okay?
1,1,SAM,I'm fine.
1,1,JESS,"It's just...you won't even talk about your family. And now you're taking off in the middle of the night to spend a weekend with them? And with Monday coming up, which is kind of a huge deal."
1,1,SAM,"Hey. Everything's going to be okay. I will be back in time, I promise."
1,1,JESS,At least tell me where you're going.
1,1,TROY,"Amy, I can't come over tonight. Because I've got work in the morning, that's why. ...Yeah, okay, I miss it and my dad's gonna have my ass."
1,1,TROY,"Hey, ah, Amy, let me call you back?"
1,1,TROY,Car trouble or something?
1,1,WOMAN,Take me home?
1,1,TROY,"Sure, get in."
1,1,TROY,"So, where do you live?"
1,1,WOMAN,At the end of Breckenridge Road.
1,1,TROY,You coming from a Halloween party or something?
1,1,TROY,"You know, a girl like you really shouldn't be alone out here."
1,1,WOMAN,I'm with you.
1,1,WOMAN,Do you think I'm pretty?
1,1,TROY,Uh...huh.
1,1,WOMAN,Will you come home with me?
1,1,TROY,Um. Hell yeah.
1,1,TROY,Come on. You don't live here.
1,1,WOMAN,I can never go home.
1,1,TROY,What are you talking about? Nobody even lives here. Where do you live?
1,1,TROY,"That's good. Joke's over, okay? You want me to leave?"
1,1,TROY,Hello? Hello?
1,1,DEAN,Hey!
1,1,DEAN,You want breakfast?
1,1,SAM,"No, thanks."
1,1,SAM,So how'd you pay for that stuff?
1,1,SAM,You and Dad still running credit card scams?
1,1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, hunting ain't exactly a pro ball career."
1,1,DEAN,"Besides, all we do is apply. It's not our fault they send us the cards."
1,1,SAM,Yeah? And what names did you write on the application this time?
1,1,DEAN,"Uh, Burt Aframian."
1,1,DEAN,And his son Hector. Scored two cards out of the deal.
1,1,SAM,"That sounds about right. I swear, man, you've gotta update your cassette tape collection."
1,1,DEAN,Why?
1,1,SAM,"Well, for one, they're cassette tapes. And two."
1,1,SAM,Black Sabbath? Motorhead? Metallica?
1,1,SAM,It's the greatest hits of mullet rock.
1,1,DEAN,"Well, house rules, Sammy."
1,1,DEAN,"Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cakehole."
1,1,SAM,"You know, Sammy is a chubby twelve-year-old."
1,1,SAM,"It's Sam, okay?"
1,1,DEAN,"Sorry, I can't hear you, the music's too loud."
1,1,SAM,Thank you.
1,1,SAM,"All right. So, there's no one matching Dad at the hospital or morgue."
1,1,SAM,"So that's something, I guess."
1,1,DEAN,Check it out.
1,1,DEAN,Let's go.
1,1,JAFFE,You guys find anything?
1,1,MAN,No! Nothing!
1,1,HEIN,"No sign of struggle, no footprints, no fingerprints. Spotless. It's almost too clean."
1,1,JAFFE,"So, this kid Troy. He's dating your daughter, isn't he?"
1,1,HEIN,Yeah.
1,1,JAFFE,How's Amy doing?
1,1,HEIN,She's putting up missing posters downtown.
1,1,DEAN,"You fellas had another one like this just last month, didn't you?"
1,1,JAFFE,And who are you?
1,1,DEAN,Federal marshals.
1,1,JAFFE,"You two are a little young for marshals, aren't you?"
1,1,DEAN,"Thanks, that's awfully kind of you."
1,1,DEAN,"You did have another one just like this, correct?"
1,1,JAFFE,"Yeah, that's right. About a mile up the road. There've been others before that."
1,1,SAM,"So, this victim, you knew him?"
1,1,JAFFE,"Town like this, everybody knows everybody."
1,1,DEAN,"Any connection between the victims, besides that they're all men?"
1,1,JAFFE,No. Not so far as we can tell.
1,1,SAM,So what's the theory?
1,1,JAFFE,"Honestly, we don't know. Serial murder? Kidnapping ring?"
1,1,DEAN,"Well, that is exactly the kind of crack police work I'd expect out of you guys."
1,1,SAM,Thank you for your time.
1,1,SAM,Gentlemen.
1,1,SAM,Ow! What was that for?
1,1,DEAN,Why'd you have to step on my foot?
1,1,SAM,Why do you have to talk to the police like that?
1,1,DEAN,"Come on. They don't really know what's going on. We're all alone on this. I mean, if we're going to find Dad we've got to get to the bottom of this thing ourselves."
1,1,SHERIFF,Can I help you boys?
1,1,DEAN,"No, sir, we were just leaving."
1,1,DEAN,Agent Mulder. Agent Scully.
1,1,DEAN,I'll bet you that's her.
1,1,SAM,Yeah.
1,1,DEAN,You must be Amy.
1,1,AMY,Yeah.
1,1,DEAN,"Yeah, Troy told us about you. We're his uncles. I'm Dean, this is Sammy."
1,1,AMY,He never mentioned you to me.
1,1,DEAN,"Well, that's Troy, I guess. We're not around much, we're up in Modesto."
1,1,SAM,"So, we're looking for him too, and we're kinda asking around."
1,1,RACHEL,"Hey, are you okay?"
1,1,AMY,Yeah.
1,1,SAM,You mind if we ask you a couple questions?
1,1,AMY,"I was on the phone with Troy. He was driving home. He said he would call me right back, and...he never did."
1,1,SAM,"He didn't say anything strange, or out of the ordinary?"
1,1,AMY,No. Nothing I can remember.
1,1,SAM,I like your necklace.
1,1,AMY,Troy gave it to me. Mostly to scare my parents—
1,1,AMY,—with all that devil stuff.
1,1,SAM,"Actually, it means just the opposite. A pentagram is protection against evil. Really powerful. I mean, if you believe in that kind of thing."
1,1,DEAN,"Okay. Thank you, Unsolved Mysteries."
1,1,DEAN,"Here's the deal, ladies. The way Troy disappeared, something's not right. So if you've heard anything..."
1,1,DEAN,What is it?
1,1,RACHEL,"Well, it's just... I mean, with all these guys going missing, people talk."
1,1,RACHEL,"It's kind of this local legend. This one girl? She got murdered out on Centennial, like decades ago."
1,1,RACHEL,"Well, supposedly she's still out there."
1,1,RACHEL,"She hitchhikes, and whoever picks her up? Well, they disappear forever."
1,1,SAM,Let me try.
1,1,DEAN,I got it.
1,1,DEAN,Dude!
1,1,DEAN,You're such a control freak.
1,1,SAM,"So angry spirits are born out of violent death, right?"
1,1,DEAN,Yeah.
1,1,SAM,"Well, maybe it's not murder."
1,1,SAM,"This was 1981. Constance Welch, twenty-four years old, jumps off Sylvania Bridge, drowns in the river."
1,1,DEAN,Does it say why she did it?
1,1,SAM,Yeah.
1,1,DEAN,What?
1,1,SAM,"An hour before they found her, she calls 911. Apparently her two little kids are in the bathtub. She leaves them alone for a minute, and when she comes back, they aren't breathing. Both die."
1,1,DEAN,Hm.
1,1,SAM,"""'Our babies were gone, and Constance just couldn't bear it,' said husband Joseph Welch."""
1,1,DEAN,The bridge look familiar to you?
1,1,DEAN,So this is where Constance took the swan dive.
1,1,SAM,So you think Dad would have been here?
1,1,DEAN,"Well, he's chasing the same story and we're chasing him."
1,1,SAM,"Okay, so now what?"
1,1,DEAN,Now we keep digging until we find him. Might take a while.
1,1,SAM,"Dean, I told you, I've gotta get back by Monday—"
1,1,DEAN,Monday. Right. The interview.
1,1,SAM,Yeah.
1,1,DEAN,"Yeah, I forgot. You're really serious about this, aren't you? You think you're just going to become some lawyer? Marry your girl?"
1,1,SAM,Maybe. Why not?
1,1,DEAN,"Does Jessica know the truth about you? I mean, does she know about the things you've done?"
1,1,SAM,"No, and she's not ever going to know."
1,1,DEAN,"Well, that's healthy. You can pretend all you want, Sammy. But sooner or later you're going to have to face up to who you really are."
1,1,SAM,And who's that?
1,1,DEAN,You're one of us.
1,1,SAM,No. I'm not like you. This is not going to be my life.
1,1,DEAN,You have a responsibility to—
1,1,SAM,"To Dad? And his crusade? If it weren't for pictures I wouldn't even know what Mom looks like. And what difference would it make? Even if we do find the thing that killed her, Mom's gone. And she isn't coming back."
1,1,DEAN,Don't talk about her like that.
1,1,DEAN,Sam.
1,1,DEAN,Where'd she go?
1,1,SAM,I don't know.
1,1,DEAN,What the—
1,1,SAM,Who's driving your car?
1,1,SAM,Dean? Go! Go!
1,1,SAM,Dean? Dean!
1,1,DEAN,What?
1,1,SAM,Hey! Are you all right?
1,1,DEAN,I'm super.
1,1,SAM,Your car all right?
1,1,SAM,"Well, she doesn't want us digging around, that's for sure. So where's the job go from here, genius?"
1,1,SAM,You smell like a toilet.
1,1,DEAN,"One room, please."
1,1,CLERK,You guys having a reunion or something?
1,1,SAM,What do you mean?
1,1,CLERK,"I had another guy, Burt Aframian. He came and bought out a room for the whole month."
1,1,SAM,Whoa.
1,1,DEAN,I don't think he's been here for a couple days at least.
1,1,SAM,"Salt, cats-eye shells...he was worried. Trying to keep something from coming in."
1,1,SAM,What have you got here?
1,1,DEAN,Centennial Highway victims.
1,1,DEAN,"I don't get it. I mean, different men, different jobs—"
1,1,DEAN,"—ages, ethnicities. There's always a connection, right? What do these guys have in common?"
1,1,SAM,Dad figured it out.
1,1,DEAN,What do you mean?
1,1,SAM,He found the same article we did. Constance Welch. She's a woman in white.
1,1,DEAN,You sly dogs.
1,1,DEAN,"All right, so if we're dealing with a woman in white, Dad would have found the corpse and destroyed it."
1,1,SAM,She might have another weakness.
1,1,DEAN,"Well, Dad would want to make sure."
1,1,DEAN,He'd dig her up. Does it say where she's buried?
1,1,SAM,"No, not that I can tell. If I were Dad, though, I'd go ask her husband."
1,1,SAM,If he's still alive.
1,1,DEAN,"All right. Why don't you, uh, see if you can find an address, I'm gonna get cleaned up."
1,1,SAM,"Hey, Dean?"
1,1,SAM,"What I said earlier, about Mom and Dad, I'm sorry."
1,1,DEAN,No chick-flick moments.
1,1,SAM,All right. Jerk.
1,1,DEAN,Bitch.
1,1,JESS,"Hey, it's me, it's about ten-twenty Saturday night—"
1,1,DEAN,"Hey, man. I'm starving, I'm gonna grab a little something to eat in that diner down the street. You want anything?"
1,1,SAM,No.
1,1,DEAN,Aframian's buying.
1,1,SAM,Mm-mm.
1,1,JESS,"So come home soon, okay? I love you."
1,1,SAM,What?
1,1,DEAN,"Dude, five-oh, take off."
1,1,SAM,What about you?
1,1,DEAN,"Uh, they kinda spotted me. Go find Dad."
1,1,DEAN,"Problem, officers?"
1,1,JAFFE,Where's your partner?
1,1,DEAN,"Partner? What, what partner?"
1,1,JAFFE,So. Fake US Marshal. Fake credit cards. You got anything that's real?
1,1,DEAN,My boobs.
1,1,JAFFE,You have the right to remain silent—
1,1,SHERIFF,So you want to give us your real name?
1,1,DEAN,"I told you, it's Nugent. Ted Nugent."
1,1,SHERIFF,I'm not sure you realize just how much trouble you're in here.
1,1,DEAN,"We talkin', like, misdemeanor kind of trouble or, uh, squeal like a pig trouble?"
1,1,SHERIFF,You got the faces of ten missing persons taped to your wall.
1,1,SHERIFF,"Along with a whole lot of Satanic mumbo-jumbo. Boy, you are officially a suspect."
1,1,DEAN,That makes sense. Because when the first one went missing in '82 I was three.
1,1,SHERIFF,I know you've got partners. One of 'em's an older guy. Maybe he started the whole thing. So tell me. Dean.
1,1,SHERIFF,This his?
1,1,SHERIFF,"I thought that might be your name. See, I leafed through this. What little I could make out—I mean, it's nine kinds of crazy."
1,1,SHERIFF,"But I found this, too."
1,1,SHERIFF,Now. You're stayin' right here till you tell me exactly what the hell that means.
1,1,SAM,Hi. Are you Joseph Welch?
1,1,JOSEPH,Yeah.
1,1,JOSEPH,"Yeah, he was older, but that's him."
1,1,JOSEPH,He came by three or four days ago. Said he was a reporter.
1,1,SAM,That's right. We're working on a story together.
1,1,JOSEPH,"Well, I don't know what the hell kinda story you're working on. The questions he asked me?"
1,1,SAM,About your wife Constance?
1,1,JOSEPH,He asked me where she was buried.
1,1,SAM,And where is that again?
1,1,JOSEPH,"What, I gotta go through this twice?"
1,1,SAM,It's fact-checking. If you don't mind.
1,1,JOSEPH,In a plot. Behind my old place over on Breckenridge.
1,1,SAM,And why did you move?
1,1,JOSEPH,I'm not gonna live in the house where my children died.
1,1,SAM,"Mr. Welch, did you ever marry again?"
1,1,JOSEPH,"No way. Constance, she was the love of my life. Prettiest woman I ever known."
1,1,SAM,So you had a happy marriage?
1,1,JOSEPH,Definitely.
1,1,SAM,"Well, that should do it. Thanks for your time."
1,1,SAM,"Mr. Welch, did you ever hear of a woman in white?"
1,1,JOSEPH,A what?
1,1,SAM,A woman in white. Or sometimes weeping woman?
1,1,SAM,"It's a ghost story. Well, it's more of a phenomenon, really."
1,1,SAM,"Um, they're spirits. They've been sighted for hundreds of years, dozens of places, in Hawaii, Mexico, lately in Arizona, Indiana. All these are different women."
1,1,SAM,You understand. But all share the same story.
1,1,JOSEPH,"Boy, I don't care much for nonsense."
1,1,SAM,"See, when they were alive, their husbands were unfaithful to them."
1,1,SAM,"And these women, basically suffering from temporary insanity, murdered their children."
1,1,SAM,"Then once they realized what they had done, they took their own lives. So now their spirits are cursed, walking back roads, waterways. And if they find an unfaithful man, they kill him. And that man is never seen again."
1,1,JOSEPH,You think...you think that has something to do with...Constance? You smartass!
1,1,SAM,You tell me.
1,1,JOSEPH,"I mean, maybe...maybe I made some mistakes. But no matter what I did, Constance, she never would have killed her own children. Now, you get the hell out of here! And you don't come back!"
1,1,DEAN,I don't know how many times I gotta tell you. It's my high school locker combo.
1,1,SHERIFF,We gonna do this all night long?
1,1,DEPUTY,"We just got a 911, shots fired over at Whiteford Road."
1,1,SHERIFF,You have to go to the bathroom?
1,1,DEAN,No.
1,1,SHERIFF,Good.
1,1,DEAN,"Fake 911 phone call? Sammy, I don't know, that's pretty illegal."
1,1,SAM,You're welcome.
1,1,DEAN,"Listen, we gotta talk."
1,1,DEAN,"Sammy, would you shut up for a second?"
1,1,SAM,I just can't figure out why Dad hasn't destroyed the corpse yet.
1,1,DEAN,"Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you. He's gone. Dad left Jericho."
1,1,SAM,What? How do you know?
1,1,DEAN,I've got his journal.
1,1,SAM,He doesn't go anywhere without that thing.
1,1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, he did this time."
1,1,SAM,What's it say?
1,1,DEAN,"Ah, the same old ex-Marine crap, when he wants to let us know where he's going."
1,1,SAM,Coordinates. Where to?
1,1,DEAN,I'm not sure yet.
1,1,SAM,"I don't understand. I mean, what could be so important that Dad would just skip out in the middle of a job? Dean, what the hell is going on?"
1,1,DEAN,Sam? Sam!
1,1,CONSTANCE,Take me home.
1,1,CONSTANCE,Take me home!
1,1,SAM,No.
1,1,SAM,Don't do this.
1,1,CONSTANCE,I can never go home.
1,1,SAM,You're scared to go home.
1,1,CONSTANCE,Hold me. I'm so cold.
1,1,SAM,You can't kill me. I'm not unfaithful. I've never been!
1,1,CONSTANCE,You will be. Just hold me.
1,1,SAM,I'm taking you home.
1,1,DEAN,Sam! Sam! You okay?
1,1,SAM,I think...
1,1,DEAN,Can you move?
1,1,SAM,Yeah. Help me?
1,1,DEAN,There you go.
1,1,CHILDREN,"You've come home to us, Mommy."
1,1,DEAN,So this is where she drowned her kids.
1,1,SAM,That's why she could never go home. She was too scared to face them.
1,1,DEAN,"You found her weak spot. Nice work, Sammy."
1,1,SAM,"Yeah, I wish I could say the same for you. What were you thinking shooting Casper in the face, you freak?"
1,1,DEAN,Hey. Saved your ass.
1,1,DEAN,I'll tell you another thing. If you screwed up my car?
1,1,DEAN,I'll kill you.
1,1,SAM,"Okay, here's where Dad went."
1,1,SAM,"It's called Blackwater Ridge, Colorado."
1,1,DEAN,Sounds charming. How far?
1,1,SAM,About six hundred miles.
1,1,DEAN,"Hey, if we shag ass we could make it by morning."
1,1,SAM,"Dean, I, um..."
1,1,DEAN,You're not going.
1,1,SAM,"The interview's in like, ten hours. I gotta be there."
1,1,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, whatever."
1,1,DEAN,I'll take you home.
1,1,SAM,Call me if you find him?
1,1,SAM,"And maybe I can meet up with you later, huh?"
1,1,DEAN,"Yeah, all right."
1,1,DEAN,Sam?
1,1,DEAN,"You know, we made a hell of a team back there."
1,1,SAM,Yeah.
1,1,SAM,Jess?
1,1,SAM,You home?
1,1,SAM,No!
1,1,DEAN,Sam!
1,1,SAM,Jess!
1,1,DEAN,Sam! Sam!
1,1,SAM,No! No!
1,1,SAM,Jess! Jess! No!
1,1,SAM,We got work to do.
1,1,LUIS,Ha!
1,1,LUIS,"What do you think, huh?"
1,1,SAM,Whatever.
1,1,LUIS,"At least I wore a costume. Man, if your sorry ass was trick-or-treating at my house, there would be no popcorn balls for you."
1,1,SAM,You gave out popcorn balls?
1,1,LUIS,"You could at least have gone as a slutty version of something. Slutty Dorothy, slutty Alice, slutty nurse—"
1,1,JESS,Hey.
1,1,LUIS,I—I didn't mean you.
1,1,SAM,"Man, what can I say? I just never been a big fan of the whole thing."
1,1,LUIS,"Never been a fan—what, what, are you a Communist? Who doesn't like Halloween?"
1,1,SAM,Jess?
1,1,SAM,You home?
1,1,SAM,No!
1,1,DEAN,Hey. How you doing?
1,1,SAM,I'm fine.
1,1,SAM,Come on. We got work to do.
1,2,DEAN (voiceover),Previously on Supernatural...
1,2,JOHN,"Take your brother outside as fast as you can! Now, Dean, go!"
1,2,JOHN,Mary! No!
1,2,DEAN,Dad's on a hunting trip.
1,2,DEAN,And he hasn't been home in a few days.
1,2,SAM,"Jess, excuse us."
1,2,SAM,I swore I was done hunting.
1,2,SAM,For good.
1,2,DEAN,I can't do this alone.
1,2,JESS,And now you're taking off in the middle of the night to spend the weekend with them?
1,2,SAM,Hey. Everything's going to be okay. I promise.
1,2,SAM (voiceover),You think Mom would have wanted this for us?
1,2,SAM (voiceover),"Dean, we were raised like warriors."
1,2,DEAN,You have a responsibility.
1,2,SAM (voiceover),To Dad? And his crusade?
1,2,SAM,"Even if we do find the thing that killed her, Mom's gone. And she isn't coming back."
1,2,DEAN,Don't talk about her like that.
1,2,DEAN (voiceover),Dad's gone. I've got his journal. He left me a message.
1,2,SAM (voiceover),"These coordinates he left us, it's weird, man."
1,2,SAM,"Hey Dean? What I said earlier, I'm sorry."
1,2,DEAN,No chick-flick moments.
1,2,SAM,Jess?
1,2,SAM,No!
1,2,SAM,We've got work to do.
1,2,BRAD,"Dude, you're cheating."
1,2,GARY,"No, you just suck."
1,2,TOM,"Hey Haley, day six, we're still out near Blackwater Ridge."
1,2,TOM,"We're fine, keeping safe, so don't worry, okay? Talk to you tomorrow."
1,2,GARY,"Hey, where ya goin'? My moment of victory."
1,2,BRAD,Nature calls.
1,2,GARY,Brad?
1,2,TOM,"Gary, what's goin' on?"
1,2,SAM,"I, uh..."
1,2,SAM,"You always said roses were, were lame, so I brought you, uh..."
1,2,SAM,Jess...oh God...
1,2,SAM,I should have protected you. I should have told you the truth.
1,2,DEAN,You okay?
1,2,SAM,"Yeah, I'm fine."
1,2,DEAN,Another nightmare?
1,2,DEAN,You wanna drive for a while?
1,2,SAM,"Dean, your whole life you never once asked me that."
1,2,DEAN,Just thought you might want to. Never mind.
1,2,SAM,"Look, man, you're worried about me."
1,2,SAM,"I get it, and thank you, but I'm perfectly okay."
1,2,DEAN,Mm-hm.
1,2,SAM,"All right, where are we?"
1,2,DEAN,We are just outside of Grand Junction.
1,2,SAM,You know what?
1,2,SAM,Maybe we shouldn't have left Stanford so soon.
1,2,DEAN,"Sam, we dug around there for a week. We came up with nothing. If you wanna find the thing that killed Jessica—"
1,2,SAM,We gotta find Dad first.
1,2,DEAN,Dad disappearing—
1,2,DEAN,"—and this thing showing up again after twenty years, it's no coincidence."
1,2,DEAN,Dad will have answers. He'll know what to do.
1,2,SAM,"It's weird, man."
1,2,SAM,These coordinates he left us.
1,2,SAM,This Blackwater Ridge.
1,2,DEAN,What about it?
1,2,SAM,There's nothing there. It's just woods.
1,2,SAM,Why is he sending us to the middle of nowhere?
1,2,SAM (voiceover),So Blackwater Ridge is pretty remote.
1,2,SAM,"It's cut off by these canyons here, rough terrain, dense forest, abandoned silver and gold mines all over the place."
1,2,DEAN,"Dude, check out the size of this freaking bear."
1,2,SAM,"And a dozen or more grizzlies in the area. It's no nature hike, that's for sure."
1,2,RANGER,You boys aren't planning on going out near Blackwater Ridge by any chance?
1,2,SAM,"Oh, no, sir, we're environmental study majors from UC Boulder, just working on a paper."
1,2,DEAN,"Recycle, man."
1,2,RANGER,Bull.
1,2,RANGER,"You're friends with that Haley girl, right?"
1,2,DEAN,"Yes. Yes, we are, Ranger—"
1,2,DEAN,Wilkinson.
1,2,RANGER,"Well I will tell you exactly what we told her. Her brother filled out a backcountry permit saying he wouldn't be back from Blackwater until the twenty-fourth, so it's not exactly a missing persons now, is it?"
1,2,RANGER,"You tell that girl to quit worrying, I'm sure her brother's just fine."
1,2,DEAN,"We will. Well that Haley girl's quite a pistol, huh?"
1,2,RANGER,That is putting it mildly.
1,2,DEAN,"Actually you know what would help is if I could show her a copy of that backcountry permit. You know, so she could see her brother's return date."
1,2,SAM,"What, are you cruising for a hookup or something?"
1,2,DEAN,What do you mean?
1,2,SAM,"The coordinates point to Blackwater Ridge, so what are we waiting for? Let's just go find Dad. I mean, why even talk to this girl?"
1,2,DEAN,"I don't know, maybe we should know what we're walking into before we actually walk into it?"
1,2,SAM,What?
1,2,DEAN,"Since when are you all shoot first ask questions later, anyway?"
1,2,SAM,Since now.
1,2,DEAN,Really?
1,2,DEAN,"You must be Haley Collins. I'm Dean, this is Sam, we're, ah, we're rangers with the Park Service. Ranger Wilkinson sent us over. He wanted us to ask a few questions about your brother Tommy."
1,2,HALEY,Lemme see some ID.
1,2,HALEY,Come on in.
1,2,DEAN,Thanks.
1,2,HALEY,That yours?
1,2,DEAN,Yeah.
1,2,HALEY,Nice car.
1,2,SAM,"So if Tommy's not due back for a while, how do you know something's wrong?"
1,2,HALEY,"He checks in every day by cell. He emails, photos, stupid little videos—we haven't heard anything in over three days now."
1,2,SAM,"Well, maybe he can't get cell reception."
1,2,HALEY,"He's got a satellite phone, too."
1,2,DEAN,Could it be he's just having fun and forgot to check in?
1,2,BEN,He wouldn't do that.
1,2,HALEY,Our parents are gone. It's just my two brothers and me. We all keep pretty close tabs on each other.
1,2,SAM,Can I see the pictures he sent you?
1,2,HALEY,Yeah.
1,2,HALEY,That's Tommy.
1,2,TOM,"Hey Haley, day six, we're still out near Blackwater Ridge. We're fine, keeping safe, so don't worry, okay? Talk to you tomorrow."
1,2,DEAN,"Well, we'll find your brother. We're heading out to Blackwater Ridge first thing."
1,2,HALEY,"Then maybe I'll see you there. Look, I can't sit around here anymore. So I hired a guy. I'm heading out in the morning, and I'm gonna find Tommy myself."
1,2,DEAN,I think I know how you feel.
1,2,SAM,"Hey, do you mind forwarding these to me?"
1,2,HALEY,Sure.
1,2,SAM,"So, Blackwater Ridge doesn't get a lot of traffic. Local campers, mostly. But still, this past April, two hikers went missing out there. They were never found."
1,2,DEAN,Any before that?
1,2,SAM,"Yeah, in 1982, eight different people all vanished in the same year. Authorities said it was a grizzly attack."
1,2,SAM,And again in 1959 and again before that in 1936.
1,2,SAM,"Every twenty-three years, just like clockwork. Okay. Watch this. Here's a clincher. I downloaded that guy Tommy's video to the laptop. Check this out."
1,2,DEAN,Do it again.
1,2,SAM,"That's three frames. That's a fraction of a second. Whatever that thing is, it can move."
1,2,DEAN,Told you something weird was going on.
1,2,SAM,Yeah.
1,2,SAM,I got one more thing.
1,2,SAM,In 'fifty-nine one camper survived this supposed grizzly attack. Just a kid. Barely crawled out of the woods alive.
1,2,DEAN,Is there a name?
1,2,SHAW,"Look, ranger, I don't know why you're asking me about this. It's public record. I was a kid. My parents got mauled by a—"
1,2,SAM,Grizzly? That's what attacked them?
1,2,DEAN,"The other people that went missing that year, those bear attacks too?"
1,2,DEAN,What about all the people that went missing this year? Same thing?
1,2,DEAN,"We knew what we were dealing with, we might be able to stop it."
1,2,SHAW,"I seriously doubt that. Anyways, I don't see what difference it would make."
1,2,SHAW,You wouldn't believe me. Nobody ever did.
1,2,SAM,"Mr. Shaw, what did you see?"
1,2,SHAW,"Nothing. It moved too fast to see. It hid too well. I heard it, though. A roar. Like...no man or animal I ever heard."
1,2,SAM,It came at night?
1,2,SAM,Got inside your tent?
1,2,SHAW,It got inside our cabin. I was sleeping in front of the fireplace when it came in. It didn't smash a window or break the door. It unlocked it. Do you know of a bear that could do something like that? I didn't even wake up till I heard my parents screaming.
1,2,SAM,It killed them?
1,2,SHAW,Dragged them off into the night.
1,2,SHAW,Why it left me alive...been asking myself that ever since.
1,2,SHAW,"Did leave me this, though."
1,2,SHAW,There's something evil in those woods. It was some sort of a demon.
1,2,DEAN,"Spirits and demons don't have to unlock doors. If they want inside, they just go through the walls."
1,2,SAM,"So it's probably something else, something corporeal."
1,2,DEAN,"Corporeal? Excuse me, professor."
1,2,SAM,Shut up. So what do you think?
1,2,DEAN,"The claws, the speed that it moves...could be a skinwalker, maybe a black dog. Whatever we're talking about, we're talking about a creature, and it's corporeal. Which means we can kill it."
1,2,SAM,We cannot let that Haley girl go out there.
1,2,DEAN,Oh yeah? What are we gonna tell her? That she can't go into the woods because of a big scary monster?
1,2,SAM,Yeah.
1,2,DEAN,"Her brother's missing, Sam. She's not gonna just sit this out. Now we go with her, we protect her, and we keep our eyes peeled for our fuzzy predator friend."
1,2,SAM,Finding Dad's not enough?
1,2,SAM,Now we gotta babysit too?
1,2,SAM,What?
1,2,DEAN,Nothing.
1,2,ROY,"I'll tell you again, I don't think Ben should come."
1,2,HALEY,Roy—
1,2,ROY,"Look, you're paying me good money to keep everybody safe. I think Ben's safest at home."
1,2,DEAN,You guys got room for two more?
1,2,HALEY,"Wait, you want to come with us?"
1,2,ROY,Who are these guys?
1,2,HALEY,Apparently this is all the park service could muster up for the search and rescue.
1,2,ROY,You're rangers?
1,2,DEAN,That's right.
1,2,HALEY,And you're hiking out in biker boots and jeans?
1,2,DEAN,"Well, sweetheart, I don't do shorts."
1,2,ROY,"What, you think this is funny? It's dangerous back country out there. Her brother might be hurt."
1,2,DEAN,"Believe me, I know how dangerous it can be. We just wanna help them find their brother, that's all."
1,2,DEAN,"Roy, you said you did a little hunting."
1,2,ROY,"Yeah, more than a little."
1,2,DEAN,Uh-huh. What kind of furry critters do you hunt?
1,2,ROY,"Mostly buck, sometimes bear."
1,2,DEAN,"Tell me, uh, Bambi or Yogi ever hunt you back?"
1,2,DEAN,"Whatcha doing, Roy?"
1,2,ROY,You should watch where you're stepping. Ranger.
1,2,DEAN,It's a bear trap.
1,2,HALEY,So who the hell are you?
1,2,DEAN,"Sam and I are brothers, and we're looking for our father. He might be here, we don't know. I just figured that you and me, we're in the same boat."
1,2,HALEY,Why didn't you just tell me that from the start?
1,2,DEAN,"I'm telling you now. 'sides, it's probably the most honest I've ever been with a woman. ...ever. So we okay?"
1,2,HALEY,"Yeah, okay."
1,2,DEAN,And what do you mean I didn't pack provisions?
1,2,ROY,This is it. Blackwater Ridge.
1,2,SAM,What coordinates are we at?
1,2,ROY,Thirty-five and minus one-eleven.
1,2,DEAN,You hear that?
1,2,SAM,Yeah. Not even crickets.
1,2,ROY,I'm gonna go take a look around.
1,2,SAM,You shouldn't go off by yourself.
1,2,ROY,That's sweet. Don't worry about me.
1,2,DEAN,"All right, everybody stays together. Let's go."
1,2,ROY,Haley! Over here!
1,2,HALEY,Oh my God.
1,2,ROY,Looks like a grizzly.
1,2,HALEY,Tommy?
1,2,HALEY,Tommy!
1,2,SAM,Shh.
1,2,HALEY,Tommy!
1,2,SAM,Shh-hh-hh!
1,2,HALEY,Why?
1,2,SAM,Something might still be out there.
1,2,DEAN,Sam!
1,2,DEAN,"The bodies were dragged from the campsite. But here, the tracks just vanish. That's weird."
1,2,DEAN,"I'll tell you what, that's no skinwalker or black dog."
1,2,DEAN,"Hey, he could still be alive."
1,2,SOMEONE,Help! Help!
1,2,SOMEONE,Help! Somebody!
1,2,HALEY,"It seemed like it was coming from around here, didn't it?"
1,2,SAM,Everybody back to camp.
1,2,HALEY,Our packs!
1,2,ROY,So much for my GPS and my satellite phone.
1,2,HALEY,What the hell is going on?
1,2,SAM,It's smart. It wants to cut us off so we can't call for help.
1,2,ROY,"You mean someone, some nutjob out there just stole all our gear."
1,2,SAM,I need to speak with you. In private.
1,2,SAM,Good. Let me see Dad's journal.
1,2,SAM,"All right, check that out."
1,2,DEAN,"Oh come on, wendigos are in the Minnesota woods or, or northern Michigan. I've never even heard of one this far west."
1,2,SAM,"Think about it, Dean, the claws, the way it can mimic a human voice."
1,2,DEAN,Great.
1,2,DEAN,Well then this is useless.
1,2,SAM,We gotta get these people to safety.
1,2,SAM,"All right, listen up, it's time to go. Things have gotten...more complicated."
1,2,HALEY,What?
1,2,ROY,"Kid, don't worry. Whatever's out there, I think I can handle it."
1,2,SAM,"It's not me I'm worried about. If you shoot this thing, you're just gonna make it mad. We have to leave. Now."
1,2,ROY,"One, you're talking nonsense. Two, you're in no position to give anybody orders."
1,2,DEAN,Relax.
1,2,SAM,"We never should have let you come out here in the first place, all right? I'm trying to protect you."
1,2,ROY,You protect me? I was hunting these woods when your mommy was still kissing you good night.
1,2,SAM,"Yeah? It's a damn near perfect hunter. It's smarter than you, and it's gonna hunt you down and eat you alive unless we get your stupid sorry ass out of here."
1,2,ROY,"You know you're crazy, right?"
1,2,SAM,Yeah? You ever hunt a wen—
1,2,HALEY,Roy!
1,2,DEAN,Chill out.
1,2,HALEY,Stop. Stop it. Everybody just stop. Look. Tommy might still be alive. And I'm not leaving here without him.
1,2,DEAN,"It's getting late. This thing is a good hunter in the day, but an unbelievable hunter at night. We'll never beat it, not in the dark. We need to settle in and protect ourselves."
1,2,HALEY,How?
1,2,HALEY,"One more time, that's—"
1,2,DEAN,Anasazi symbols. It's for protection. The wendigo can't cross over them.
1,2,DEAN,"Nobody likes a skeptic, Roy."
1,2,DEAN,You wanna tell me what's going on in that freaky head of yours?
1,2,SAM,Dean—
1,2,DEAN,"No, you're not fine. You're like a powder keg, man, it's not like you. I'm supposed to be the belligerent one, remember?"
1,2,SAM,"Dad's not here. I mean, that much we know for sure, right? He would have left us a message, a sign, right?"
1,2,DEAN,"Yeah, you're probably right. Tell you the truth, I don't think Dad's ever been to Lost Creek."
1,2,SAM,"Then let's get these people back to town and let's hit the road. Go find Dad. I mean, why are we still even here?"
1,2,DEAN,This is why.
1,2,DEAN,"This book. This is Dad's single most valuable possession—everything he knows about every evil thing is in here. And he's passed it on to us. I think he wants us to pick up where he left off. You know, saving people, hunting things. The family business."
1,2,SAM,"That makes no sense. Why doesn't he just—call us? Why doesn't he—tell us what he wants, tell us where he is?"
1,2,DEAN,"I dunno. But the way I see it, Dad's giving us a job to do, and I intend to do it."
1,2,SAM,Dean...no. I gotta find Dad. I gotta find Jessica's killer. It's the only thing I can think about.
1,2,DEAN,"Okay, all right, Sam, we'll find them, I promise. Listen to me. You've gotta prepare yourself. I mean, this search could take a while, and all that anger, you can't keep it burning over the long haul. It's gonna kill you. You gotta have patience, man."
1,2,SAM,How do you do it? How does Dad do it?
1,2,DEAN,"Well for one, them."
1,2,DEAN,"I mean, I figure our family's so screwed to hell, maybe we can help some others. Makes things a little bit more bearable."
1,2,DEAN,I'll tell you what else helps.
1,2,DEAN,Killing as many evil sons of bitches as I possibly can.
1,2,WENDIGO,Help!
1,2,DEAN,"He's trying to draw us out. Just stay cool, stay put."
1,2,ROY,Inside the magic circle?
1,2,WENDIGO,Help! Help me!
1,2,ROY,"Okay, that's no grizzly."
1,2,HALEY,"It's okay. You'll be all right, I promise."
1,2,SAM,It's here.
1,2,ROY,I hit it!
1,2,DEAN,"Roy, no! Roy!"
1,2,DEAN,Don't move.
1,2,ROY,It's over here! It's in the tree!
1,2,DEAN,Roy!
1,2,HALEY,"I don't...I mean, these types of things, they aren't supposed to be real."
1,2,DEAN,I wish I could tell you different.
1,2,HALEY,How do we know it's not out there watching us?
1,2,DEAN,We don't. But we're safe for now.
1,2,HALEY,How do you know about this stuff?
1,2,DEAN,Kind of runs in the family.
1,2,SAM,Hey.
1,2,SAM,So we've got half a chance in the daylight. And I for one want to kill this evil son of a bitch.
1,2,DEAN,"Well, hell, you know I'm in."
1,2,SAM,'Wendigo' is a Cree Indian word. It means 'evil that devours'.
1,2,DEAN,"They're hundreds of years old. Each one was once a man. Sometimes an Indian, or other times a frontiersman or a miner or hunter."
1,2,HALEY,How's a man turn into one of those things?
1,2,DEAN,"Well, it's always the same. During some harsh winter a guy finds himself starving, cut off from supplies or help. Becomes a cannibal to survive, eating other members of his tribe or camp."
1,2,BEN,Like the Donner Party.
1,2,SAM,"Cultures all over the world believe that eating human flesh gives a person certain abilities. Speed, strength, immortality."
1,2,DEAN,"If you eat enough of it, over years, you become this less than human thing. You're always hungry."
1,2,HALEY,"So if that's true, how can Tommy still be alive?"
1,2,DEAN,You're not gonna like it.
1,2,HALEY,Tell me.
1,2,DEAN,"More than anything, a wendigo knows how to last long winters without food. It hibernates for years at a time, but when it's awake it keeps its victims alive. It, uh, it stores them, so it can feed whenever it wants. If your brother's alive, it's keeping him somewhere dark, hidden, and safe. We gotta track it back there."
1,2,HALEY,And then how do we stop it?
1,2,DEAN,"Well, guns are useless, so are knives. Basically—"
1,2,DEAN,We gotta torch the sucker.
1,2,SAM,Dean.
1,2,DEAN,What is it?
1,2,SAM,"You know, I was thinking, those claw prints, so clear and distinct. They were almost too easy to follow."
1,2,SAM,You okay? You got it?
1,2,DEAN,His neck's broke.
1,2,DEAN,"Okay, run, run, run, run, go, go, go!"
1,2,SAM,"Come on, I gotcha, I gotcha."
1,2,BEN,Haley?
1,2,SAM,Dean!
1,2,BEN,"If it keeps its victims alive, why would it kill Roy?"
1,2,SAM,"Honestly? I think because Roy shot at it, pissed it off."
1,2,BEN,They went this way.
1,2,SAM,It's better than breadcrumbs.
1,2,SAM,"Hey, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
1,2,SAM,Dean!
1,2,BEN,"Haley, wake up!"
1,2,SAM,Dean!
1,2,SAM,"Hey, you okay?"
1,2,DEAN,Yeah.
1,2,BEN,"Haley, Haley, wake up, wake up!"
1,2,SAM,You sure you're all right?
1,2,DEAN,Yeah. Yep. Where is he?
1,2,SAM,He's gone for now.
1,2,HALEY,Tommy...
1,2,HALEY,Cut him down!
1,2,HALEY,We're gonna get you home.
1,2,DEAN,Check it out.
1,2,SAM,Flare guns. Those'll work.
1,2,DEAN,Looks like someone's home for supper.
1,2,HALEY,We'll never outrun it.
1,2,DEAN,You thinking what I'm thinking?
1,2,SAM,"Yeah, I think so."
1,2,DEAN,"All right, listen to me. Stay with Sam. He's gonna get you out of here."
1,2,HALEY,What are you gonna do?
1,2,SAM,"All right, come on! Hurry!"
1,2,DEAN,"Hey, you want some white meat, bitch! I'm right here!"
1,2,SAM,Get him outta here.
1,2,HALEY,"Sam, no."
1,2,BEN,"Come on, Haley!"
1,2,SAM,Come on. Come on.
1,2,HALEY,Sam!
1,2,SAM,"Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry."
1,2,SAM,Get behind me.
1,2,DEAN,Hey!
1,2,DEAN,"Not bad, huh?"
1,2,OFFICER,And the bear came back again after you yelled at it?
1,2,BEN,"That's when it circled the campsite. I mean, this grizzly must have weighed eight hundred, nine hundred pounds."
1,2,OFFICER,"All right, we'll go after it first thing."
1,2,HALEY,So I don't know how to thank you.
1,2,HALEY,Must you cheapen the moment?
1,2,DEAN,Yeah.
1,2,PARAMEDIC,You riding with your brother?
1,2,HALEY,Yeah.
1,2,HALEY,Let's go.
1,2,HALEY,I hope you find your father.
1,2,HALEY,"Thanks, Sam."
1,2,PARAMEDIC 2,Close her up.
1,2,DEAN,"Man, I hate camping."
1,2,SAM,Me too.
1,2,DEAN,"Sam, you know we're gonna find Dad, right?"
1,2,SAM,"Yeah, I know. But in the meantime? I'm driving."
1,2,SAM,"That's a hell of a find, Ben. Those are Anasazi."
1,2,BEN,What's that?
1,2,SAM,Ancient Indians. They were this whole civilization that just vanished completely. No one really knows why.
1,2,SAM,I've seen that somewhere before.
1,2,ROY,Haley! Over here!
1,3,JOHN,"Take your brother outside as fast as you can! Now, Dean, go!"
1,3,JOHN,Mary! No!
1,3,DEAN,Dad's on a hunting trip.
1,3,DEAN,And he hasn't been home in a few days.
1,3,SAM,I swore I was done hunting.
1,3,DEAN,I can't do this alone.
1,3,SAM,No!
1,3,SAM,We've got work to do.
1,3,DEAN,—most valuable possession—everything he knows about every evil thing is in here. And he's passed it on to us. I think he wants us to—
1,3,DEAN,The family business.
1,3,SAM,No. I gotta find Jessica's killer.
1,3,DEAN,"Sam, you know we're gonna find Dad, right?"
1,3,SAM,Yeah. I know.
1,3,SOPHIE,"Morning, Daddy."
1,3,BILL,"Morning, sweetheart."
1,3,WILL,"All these workouts, Soph, I don't know. Guys don't like buff girls."
1,3,SOPHIE,"Yeah, well, girls don't like guys who still live at home."
1,3,WILL,Ha ha ha.
1,3,SOPHIE,Ha ha.
1,3,BILL,Be careful.
1,3,SOPHIE,I will.
1,3,WENDY,Can I get you anything else?
1,3,SAM,"Just the check, please."
1,3,WENDY,Okay.
1,3,DEAN,"You know, Sam, we are allowed to have fun once in a while."
1,3,DEAN,That's fun.
1,3,DEAN,"Here, take a look at this, I think I got one. Lake Manitoc, Wisconsin. Last week Sophie Carlton, eighteen, walks into the lake, doesn't walk out. Authorities dragged the water; nothing. Sophie Carlton is the third Lake Manitoc drowning this year. None of the other bodies were found either. They had a funeral two days ago."
1,3,SAM,A funeral?
1,3,DEAN,"Yeah, it's weird, they buried an empty coffin. For, uh, closure or whatever."
1,3,SAM,"Closure? What closure? People don't just disappear, Dean. Other people just stop looking for them."
1,3,DEAN,Something you want to say to me?
1,3,SAM,The trail for Dad. It's getting colder every day.
1,3,DEAN,Exactly. So what are we supposed to do?
1,3,SAM,I don't know. Something. Anything.
1,3,DEAN,You know what? I'm sick of this attitude. You don't think I wanna find Dad as much as you do?
1,3,SAM,"Yeah, I know you do, it's just—"
1,3,DEAN,"I'm the one that's been with him every single day for the past two years, while you've been off to college going to pep rallies. We will find Dad, but until then, we're gonna kill everything bad between here and there. Okay?"
1,3,SAM,"All right, Lake Manitoc. Hey!"
1,3,DEAN,Huh?
1,3,SAM,How far?
1,3,DEAN,Will Carlton?
1,3,WILL,"Yeah, that's right."
1,3,DEAN,I'm Agent Ford. This is Agent Hamill.
1,3,DEAN,We're with the US Wildlife Service.
1,3,WILL,She was about a hundred yards out.
1,3,WILL,That's where she got dragged down.
1,3,DEAN,And you're sure she didn't just drown?
1,3,WILL,Yeah. She was a varsity swimmer.
1,3,WILL,She practically grew up in that lake. She was as safe out there as in her own bathtub.
1,3,SAM,So no splashing? No signs of distress?
1,3,WILL,"No, that's what I'm telling you."
1,3,SAM,Did you see any shadows in the water? Maybe some dark shape breach the surface?
1,3,WILL,"No. Again, she was really far out there."
1,3,DEAN,You ever see any strange tracks by the shoreline?
1,3,WILL,"No, never. Why? Why, what do you think's out there?"
1,3,DEAN,We'll let you know as soon as we do.
1,3,SAM,What about your father?
1,3,SAM,Can we talk to him?
1,3,WILL,"Look, if you don't mind, I mean...he didn't see anything and he's kind of been through a lot."
1,3,SAM,We understand.
1,3,JAKE,"Now, I'm sorry, but why does the Wildlife Service care about an accidental drowning?"
1,3,SAM,You sure it's accidental? Will Carlton saw something grab his sister.
1,3,JAKE,Like what?
1,3,JAKE,"Here, sit, please. There are no indigenous carnivores in that lake."
1,3,JAKE,"There's nothing even big enough to pull down a person, unless it was the Loch Ness Monster."
1,3,DEAN,Yeah.
1,3,DEAN,Right.
1,3,JAKE,"Will Carlton was traumatized, and sometimes the mind plays tricks. Still—"
1,3,JAKE,"We dragged that entire lake. We even ran a sonar sweep, just to be sure, and there was nothing down there."
1,3,DEAN,"That's weird, though, I mean, that's, that's the third missing body this year."
1,3,JAKE,I know. These are people from my town. These are people I care about.
1,3,DEAN,I know.
1,3,JAKE,Anyway...
1,3,JAKE,All this...it won't be a problem much longer.
1,3,DEAN,What do you mean?
1,3,JAKE,"Well, the dam, of course."
1,3,DEAN,"Of course, the dam. It's, uh, it sprung a leak."
1,3,JAKE,"It's falling apart, and the feds won't give us the grant to repair it, so they've opened the spillway. In another six months, there won't be much of a lake. There won't be much of a town, either. But as Federal Wildlife, you already knew that."
1,3,DEAN,Exactly.
1,3,ANDREA,"Sorry, am I interrupting?"
1,3,ANDREA,I can come back later.
1,3,JAKE,"Gentlemen, this is my daughter."
1,3,DEAN,It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dean.
1,3,ANDREA,Andrea Barr. Hi.
1,3,DEAN,Hi.
1,3,JAKE,They're from the Wildlife Service. About the lake.
1,3,ANDREA,Oh.
1,3,DEAN,"Oh, hey there. What's your name?"
1,3,JAKE,His name is Lucas.
1,3,SAM,Is he okay?
1,3,JAKE,My grandson's been through a lot. We all have.
1,3,JAKE,"Well, if there's anything else I can do for you, please let me know."
1,3,DEAN,"Thanks. You know, now that you mentioned it, could you point us in the direction of a reasonably priced motel?"
1,3,ANDREA,Lakefront Motel. Go around the corner. It's about two blocks south.
1,3,DEAN,Two—would you mind showing us?
1,3,ANDREA,You want me to walk you two blocks?
1,3,DEAN,Not if it's any trouble.
1,3,ANDREA,I'm headed that way anyway.
1,3,ANDREA,I'll be back to pick up Lucas at three.
1,3,ANDREA,"We'll go to the park, okay, sweetie?"
1,3,SAM,Thanks again.
1,3,DEAN,"So, cute kid."
1,3,ANDREA,Thanks.
1,3,DEAN,"Kids are the best, huh?"
1,3,ANDREA,"There it is. Like I said, two blocks."
1,3,SAM,Thanks.
1,3,ANDREA,"Must be hard, with your sense of direction, never being able to find your way to a decent pickup line."
1,3,ANDREA,Enjoy your stay!
1,3,SAM,'Kids are the best'? You don't even like kids.
1,3,DEAN,I love kids.
1,3,SAM,Name three children that you even know.
1,3,DEAN,I'm thinking!
1,3,SAM,So there's the three drowning victims this year.
1,3,DEAN,Any before that?
1,3,SAM,"Uh, yeah."
1,3,SAM,"Six more spread out over the past thirty-five years. Those bodies were never recovered either. If there is something out there, it's picking up its pace."
1,3,DEAN,"So, what, we got a lake monster on a binge?"
1,3,SAM,"This whole lake monster theory, it, it just bugs me."
1,3,DEAN,Why?
1,3,SAM,"Loch Ness, uh, Lake Champlain, there are literally hundreds of eyewitness accounts, but here, almost nothing."
1,3,SAM,"Whatever it is out there, no one's living to talk about it."
1,3,DEAN,"Wait, Barr, Christopher Barr. Where have I heard that name before?"
1,3,SAM,"Christopher Barr, the victim in May."
1,3,SAM,"Oh. Christopher Barr was Andrea's husband, Lucas's father. Apparently he took Lucas out swimming. Lucas was on a floating wooden platform when Chris drowned. Two hours before the kid got rescued."
1,3,SAM,Maybe we have an eyewitness after all.
1,3,DEAN,No wonder that kid was so freaked out. Watching one of your parents die isn't something you just get over.
1,3,SAM (voiceover),Can we join you?
1,3,ANDREA,I'm here with my son.
1,3,DEAN,Oh. Mind if I say hi?
1,3,SAM,I don't think that's what this is about.
1,3,DEAN,How's it going?
1,3,DEAN,"Oh, I used to love these things."
1,3,DEAN,So crayons is more your thing? That's cool. Chicks dig artists.
1,3,DEAN,"Hey, these are pretty good. You mind if I sit and draw with you for a while?"
1,3,DEAN,I'm not so bad myself.
1,3,DEAN,"You know, I'm thinking you can hear me, you just don't want to talk. I don't know exactly what happened to your dad, but I know it was something real bad. I think I know how you feel. When I was your age, I saw something."
1,3,DEAN,"Anyway. Well, maybe you don't think anyone will listen to you, or, uh...or believe you. I want you to know that I will. You don't even have to say anything. You could draw me a picture about what you saw that day, with your dad, on the lake. Okay, no problem. This is for you."
1,3,DEAN,This is my family.
1,3,DEAN,"That's my dad. That's my mom. That's my geek brother, and that's me."
1,3,DEAN,"All right, so I'm a sucky artist. I'll see you around, Lucas."
1,3,ANDREA,"Lucas hasn't said a word, not even to me. Not since his dad's accident."
1,3,DEAN,"Yeah, we heard. Sorry."
1,3,SAM,What are the doctors saying?
1,3,ANDREA,That it's a kind of post-traumatic stress.
1,3,SAM,That can't be easy. For either of you.
1,3,ANDREA,"We moved in with my dad. He helps out a lot. It's just...when I think about what Lucas went through, what he saw..."
1,3,DEAN,Kids are strong. You'd be surprised what they can deal with.
1,3,ANDREA,"You know, he used to have such life. He was hard to keep up with, to tell you the truth. Now he just sits there. Drawing those pictures, playing with those army men. I just wish—"
1,3,ANDREA,Hey sweetie.
1,3,DEAN,"Thanks. Thanks, Lucas."
1,3,WILL,"Hey, Dad? You, you should probably eat something. I'm gonna make some dinner, okay?"
1,3,SAM,"So, I think it's safe to say we can rule out Nessie."
1,3,DEAN,What do you mean?
1,3,SAM,I just drove past the Carlton house. There was an ambulance there. Will Carlton is dead.
1,3,DEAN,He drowned?
1,3,SAM,Yep. In the sink.
1,3,DEAN,"What the hell? So you're right, this isn't a creature. We're dealing with something else."
1,3,SAM,"Yeah, but what?"
1,3,DEAN,"I don't know. Water wraith, maybe? Some kind of demon? I mean, something that controls water...water that comes from the same source."
1,3,SAM,The lake.
1,3,DEAN,Yeah.
1,3,SAM,"Which would explain why it's upping the body count. The lake is draining. It'll be dry in a few months. Whatever this thing is, whatever it wants, it's running out of time."
1,3,DEAN,"And if it can get through the pipes, it can get to anyone, almost anywhere."
1,3,DEAN,This is gonna happen again soon.
1,3,DEAN,"Yeah, it took both his kids."
1,3,SAM,"And I've been asking around. Lucas's dad, Chris—Bill Carlton's godson."
1,3,DEAN,Let's go pay Mr. Carlton a visit.
1,3,SAM (voiceover),Mr. Carlton?
1,3,SAM,"We'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind."
1,3,DEAN,"We're from the, the Department—"
1,3,BILL,I don't care who you're with. I've answered enough questions today.
1,3,SAM,"Your son said he saw something in that lake. What about you? You ever see anything out there? Mr. Carlton, Sophie's drowning and Will's death—we think there might be a connection to you or your family."
1,3,BILL,My children are gone. It's...it's worse than dying. Go away. Please.
1,3,SAM,What do you think?
1,3,DEAN,"Aw, I think the poor guy's been through hell. I also think he's not telling us something."
1,3,SAM,So now what?
1,3,SAM,What is it?
1,3,DEAN,Huh.
1,3,DEAN,Maybe Bill's not the only one who knows something.
1,3,ANDREA (voiceover),"I'm sorry, but I don't think it's a good idea."
1,3,DEAN (voiceover),I just need to talk to him.
1,3,DEAN,Just for a few minutes.
1,3,ANDREA,He won't say anything. What good's it gonna do?
1,3,SAM,"Andrea, we think more people might get hurt. We think something's happening out there."
1,3,ANDREA,"My husband, the others, they just drowned. That's all."
1,3,DEAN,"Hey, Lucas. You remember me?"
1,3,DEAN,"You know, I, uh, I wanted to thank you for that last drawing. But the thing is, I need your help again."
1,3,DEAN,How did you know to draw this? Did you know something bad was gonna happen? Maybe you could nod yes or no for me.
1,3,DEAN,"You're scared. It's okay. I understand. See, when I was your age, I saw something real bad happen to my mom, and I was scared, too. I didn't feel like talking, just like you. But see, my mom—I know she wanted me to be brave. I think about that every day. And I do my best to be brave. And maybe, your dad wants you to be brave too."
1,3,DEAN,"Thanks, Lucas."
1,3,DEAN,Andrea said the kid never drew like that till his dad died.
1,3,SAM,"There are cases—going through a traumatic experience could make people more sensitive to premonitions, psychic tendencies."
1,3,DEAN,"Whatever's out there, what if Lucas is tapping into it somehow? I mean, it's only a matter of time before somebody else drowns, so if you got a better lead, please."
1,3,SAM,"All right, we got another house to find."
1,3,DEAN,The only problem is there's about a thousand yellow two-stories in this county alone.
1,3,SAM,See this church? I bet there's less than a thousand of those around here.
1,3,DEAN,"Oh, College Boy thinks he's so smart."
1,3,SAM,"You know, um..."
1,3,SAM,What you said about Mom...
1,3,SAM,You never told me that before.
1,3,DEAN,It's no big deal.
1,3,DEAN,"Oh God, we're not gonna have to hug or anything, are we?"
1,3,DEAN (voiceover),"We're sorry to bother you, ma'am—"
1,3,DEAN,"—but does a little boy live here, by chance? He might wear a blue ball cap, has a red bicycle."
1,3,SWEENEY,No sir. Not for a very long time. Peter's been gone for thirty-five years now.
1,3,SWEENEY,"Losing him—you know, it's...it's worse than dying."
1,3,DEAN,"Did he disappear from here? I mean, from this house?"
1,3,SWEENEY,"He was supposed to ride his bike straight home after school, and he never showed up."
1,3,DEAN,"Peter Sweeney and Billy Carlton, nineteen seventy."
1,3,BILL,"You've taken everything, everyone. I've got nothing left. I didn't understand. I didn't believe. Now I think I do. I think I finally know what you want."
1,3,SAM,"Okay, this little boy Peter Sweeney vanishes, and this is all connected to Bill Carlton somehow."
1,3,DEAN,"Yeah, Bill sure as hell seems to be hiding something, huh?"
1,3,SAM,"And Bill, the people he loves, they're all getting punished."
1,3,DEAN,So what if Bill did something to Peter?
1,3,SAM,What if Bill killed him?
1,3,DEAN,Peter's spirit would be furious. It'd want revenge. It's possible.
1,3,SAM,Mr. Carlton?
1,3,DEAN,"Hey, check it out."
1,3,DEAN,Mr. Carlton! You need to come back! Come out of the water! Turn the boat around!
1,3,SAM,Mr. Carlton!
1,3,ANDREA,"Baby, what's wrong?"
1,3,ANDREA,"Sam, Dean."
1,3,ANDREA,I didn't expect to see you here.
1,3,JAKE,So now you're on a first-name basis. What are you doing here?
1,3,ANDREA,I brought you dinner.
1,3,JAKE,"I'm sorry, sweetheart, I don't really have the time."
1,3,ANDREA,I heard about Bill Carlton. Is it true? Is something going on with the lake?
1,3,JAKE,Right now we don't know what the truth is. But I think it might be better if you and Lucas went on home.
1,3,DEAN,"Lucas, hey, what is it?"
1,3,DEAN,Lucas.
1,3,ANDREA,Lucas.
1,3,DEAN,"Lucas, it's okay. It's okay. Hey, Lucas, it's okay. It's okay."
1,3,JAKE,"Okay, just so I'm clear, you see...something attack Bill's boat, sending Bill—who is a very good swimmer, by the way—into the drink, and you never see him again?"
1,3,DEAN,"Yeah, that about sums it up."
1,3,JAKE,"And I'm supposed to believe this, even though I've already sonar-swept that entire lake? And what you're describing is impossible? And you're not really Wildlife Service?"
1,3,JAKE,"That's right, I checked. Department's never heard of you two."
1,3,DEAN,"See, now, we can explain that."
1,3,JAKE,"Enough. Please. The only reason you're breathing free air is one of Bill's neighbors saw him steering out that boat just before you did. So, we have a couple of options here. I can arrest you for impersonating government officials and hold you as material witnesses to Bill Carlton's disappearance. Or, we can chalk this all up to a bad day, you get into your car, you put this town in your rearview mirror, and you don't ever darken my doorstep again."
1,3,SAM,Door number two sounds good.
1,3,JAKE,That's the one I'd pick.
1,3,ANDREA,"Baby, what are you doing up? Come on. Let's go to bed."
1,3,SAM,Green.
1,3,DEAN,What?
1,3,SAM,Light's green.
1,3,SAM,"Uh, the interstate's the other way."
1,3,DEAN,I know.
1,3,SAM,"But Dean, this job, I think it's over."
1,3,DEAN,I'm not so sure.
1,3,SAM,"If Bill murdered Peter Sweeney and Peter's spirit got its revenge, case closed. The spirit should be at rest."
1,3,DEAN,"All right, so what if we take off and this thing isn't done? You know, what if we've missed something? What if more people get hurt?"
1,3,SAM,But why would you think that?
1,3,DEAN,Because Lucas was really scared.
1,3,SAM,That's what this is about?
1,3,DEAN,I just don't want to leave this town until I know the kid's okay.
1,3,SAM,Who are you? And what have you done with my brother?
1,3,DEAN,Shut up.
1,3,SAM,"Are you sure about this? It's pretty late, man."
1,3,DEAN,Lucas? Lucas!
1,3,SAM,Can you tell me?
1,3,ANDREA,No.
1,3,ANDREA,It doesn't make any sense.
1,3,ANDREA,I'm going crazy.
1,3,SAM,"No, you're not. Tell me what happened. Everything."
1,3,ANDREA,I heard...I thought I heard...there was this voice.
1,3,SAM,What did it say?
1,3,ANDREA,It said...it said 'come play with me'.
1,3,ANDREA,What's happening?
1,3,DEAN,Do you recognize the kids in these pictures?
1,3,ANDREA,"What? Um, um, no. I mean, except that's my dad right there. He must have been about twelve in these pictures."
1,3,DEAN,Chris Barr's drowning. The connection wasn't to Bill Carlton. It must have been to the sheriff.
1,3,ANDREA,What about Chris? My dad—what are you talking about?
1,3,DEAN,Lucas?
1,3,DEAN,"Lucas, what is it?"
1,3,ANDREA,"Lucas, honey?"
1,3,DEAN,"You and Lucas get back to the house and stay there, okay?"
1,3,SAM,Peter's bike.
1,3,JAKE,Who are you?
1,3,SAM,"Put the gun down, Jake."
1,3,JAKE,How did you know that was there?
1,3,DEAN,"What happened? You and Bill killed Peter, drowned him in the lake and then buried the bike? You can't bury the truth, Jake. Nothing stays buried."
1,3,ANDREA,"Go to your room, sweetie. Now. Lock the door and wait for me. Don't come out."
1,3,JAKE,I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
1,3,DEAN,You and Bill killed Peter Sweeney thirty-five years ago. That's what the hell I'm talking about.
1,3,ANDREA,Dad!
1,3,DEAN,And now you got one seriously pissed-off spirit.
1,3,SAM,"It's gonna take Andrea, Lucas, everyone you love. It's gonna drown them. And it's gonna drag their bodies God knows where, so you can feel the same pain Peter's mom felt. And then, after that, it's gonna take you, and it's not gonna stop until it does."
1,3,JAKE,"Yeah, and how do you know that?"
1,3,SAM,Because that's exactly what it did to Bill Carlton.
1,3,JAKE,"Listen to yourselves, both of you. You're insane."
1,3,DEAN,"I don't really give a rat's ass what you think of us. But if we're gonna bring down this spirit, we need to find the remains, salt them, and burn them into dust. Now tell me you buried Peter somewhere. Tell me you didn't just let him go in the lake."
1,3,PETER,Come play with me.
1,3,ANDREA,"Dad, is any of this true?"
1,3,JAKE,No. Don't listen to them. They're liars and they're dangerous.
1,3,ANDREA,"Something tried to drown me. Chris died on that lake. Dad, look at me."
1,3,ANDREA,Tell me you—you didn't kill anyone.
1,3,ANDREA,Oh my God.
1,3,JAKE,"Billy and I were at the lake. Peter was the smallest one. We always bullied him, but this time, it got rough. We were holding his head under the water. We didn't mean to. But we held him under too long and he drowned. We let the body go, and it sank."
1,3,JAKE,"Oh, Andrea, we were kids. We were so scared. It was a mistake. But, Andrea, to say that I have anything to do with these drownings, with Chris, because of some ghost? It's not rational."
1,3,DEAN,"All right, listen to me, all of you. We need to get you away from this lake, as far as we can, right now."
1,3,JAKE,Lucas!
1,3,PETER,Come play with me.
1,3,DEAN,Lucas!
1,3,ANDREA,"Lucas! Baby, stay where you are!"
1,3,ANDREA,Oh my God!
1,3,SAM,"Andrea, stay there!"
1,3,ANDREA,No! Lucas!
1,3,SAM,We'll get him! Just stay on the dock!
1,3,DEAN,Sam?
1,3,ANDREA,"Lucas, where are you?"
1,3,JAKE,"Peter, if you can hear me...please, Peter, I'm sorry. I'm so—I'm so sorry."
1,3,ANDREA,"Daddy, no!"
1,3,JAKE,"Peter. Lucas—he's, he's just a little boy. Please, it's not his fault, it's mine. Please take me."
1,3,DEAN,"Jake, no!"
1,3,JAKE,Just let it be over!
1,3,ANDREA,Daddy! Daddy! No!
1,3,ANDREA,No!
1,3,SAM,"Look, we're not gonna save everybody."
1,3,DEAN,I know.
1,3,ANDREA,"Sam, Dean."
1,3,DEAN,Hey.
1,3,ANDREA,"We're glad we caught you. We just, um, we made you lunch for the road."
1,3,ANDREA,Lucas insisted on making the sandwiches himself.
1,3,LUCAS,Can I give it to them now?
1,3,ANDREA,Of course.
1,3,DEAN,"Come on, Lucas, let's load this into the car."
1,3,SAM,How you holding up?
1,3,ANDREA,"It's just gonna take a long time to sort through everything, you know?"
1,3,SAM,"Andrea, I'm sorry."
1,3,ANDREA,"You saved my son. I can't ask for more than that. Dad loved me. He loved Lucas. No matter what he did, I just have to hold on to that."
1,3,DEAN,"All right, if you're gonna be talking now, this is a very important phrase, so I want you to repeat it one more time."
1,3,LUCAS,Zeppelin rules!
1,3,DEAN,That's right. Up high.
1,3,DEAN,"You take care of your mom, okay?"
1,3,LUCAS,All right.
1,3,ANDREA,Thank you.
1,3,DEAN,"Sam, move your ass. We're gonna run out of daylight before we hit the road."
1,4,JOHN,"Take your brother outside as fast as you can! Now, Dean, go!"
1,4,JOHN,Mary! No!
1,4,DEAN,Dad's on a hunting trip.
1,4,DEAN,And he hasn't been home in a few days.
1,4,SAM,I swore I was done hunting.
1,4,DEAN,I can't do this alone.
1,4,SAM,No!
1,4,SAM,We've got work to do.
1,4,DEAN,—most valuable possession—everything he knows about every evil thing is in here. I think he wants us to—
1,4,DEAN,The family business.
1,4,SAM,No. I gotta find Jessica's killer.
1,4,DEAN,"Sam, you know we're gonna find Dad, right?"
1,4,SAM,Yeah. I know.
1,4,INTERCOM,Thank you for flying United Britannia Airlines.
1,4,SECOND MAN,Nervous flyer?
1,4,PHELPS,"It's that obvious, huh?"
1,4,SECOND MAN,"You know, what are the odds of dying in a plane crash? I mean, what? Twenty thousand to one?"
1,4,PHELPS,"Wow. That's, uh, really reassuring. Thank you."
1,4,PILOT,Thanks.
1,4,CHUCK,"Amanda, how are you today?"
1,4,AMANDA,"I'm doing just fine, Chuck."
1,4,AMANDA,"Welcome aboard. 15C towards the back of the plane, on the right."
1,4,PASSENGER,Thank you.
1,4,AMANDA,"Have a nice flight, sir."
1,4,PHELPS,"Oh, I'm counting on it."
1,4,AMANDA,"Um...uh, 11F, that's the middle of the plane, on..."
1,4,PASSENGER 2,Thank you.
1,4,AMANDA,...the left.
1,4,COPILOT,In just a few minutes our flight crew will begin room service in the cabin...
1,4,PHELPS,Excuse me. Do you know how long we've been up?
1,4,WOMAN,"Oh, uh..."
1,4,WOMAN,About forty minutes.
1,4,PHELPS,"Wow. Time really does fly, huh? Excuse me. I've got to stretch my legs."
1,4,MAX,"Hey, what the hell are you doing?!"
1,4,SAM,"Morning, sunshine."
1,4,DEAN,What time is it?
1,4,SAM,"Uh, it's about five forty-five."
1,4,DEAN,In the morning?
1,4,SAM,Yep.
1,4,DEAN,Where does the day go?
1,4,DEAN,Did you get any sleep last night?
1,4,SAM,"Yeah, I grabbed a couple hours."
1,4,DEAN,"Liar. 'Cause I was up at three, and you were watching a George Foreman infomercial."
1,4,SAM,"Hey, what can I say? It's riveting TV."
1,4,DEAN,When was the last time you got a good night's sleep?
1,4,SAM,"I don't know, a little while, I guess. It's not a big deal."
1,4,DEAN,"Yeah, it is."
1,4,SAM,"Look, I appreciate your concern—"
1,4,DEAN,"Oh, I'm not concerned about you. It's your job to keep my ass alive, so I need you sharp."
1,4,DEAN,"Seriously, are you still having nightmares about Jess?"
1,4,SAM,"Yeah. But it's not just her. It's everything. I just forgot, you know? This job. Man, it gets to you."
1,4,DEAN,You can't let it. You can't bring it home like that.
1,4,SAM,"So, what? All this it...never keeps you up at night?"
1,4,SAM,Never? You're never afraid?
1,4,DEAN,"No, not really."
1,4,DEAN,That's not fear. That is precaution.
1,4,SAM,"All right, whatever. I'm too tired to argue."
1,4,DEAN,Hello?
1,4,JERRY,"Dean, it's, uh, it's Jerry Panowski. You and your dad helped me out a couple years back."
1,4,DEAN,"Oh, right, yeah. Up in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, the poltergeist thing. It's not back, is it?"
1,4,JERRY,"No. No. Thank god, no. But it's something else, and...uh, I think it could be a lot worse."
1,4,DEAN,What is it?
1,4,JERRY,Can we talk in person?
1,4,JERRY,"Thanks for making the trip so quick. I ought to be doing you guys a favor, not the other way around. Dean and your dad really helped me out."
1,4,SAM,"Yeah, he told me. It was a poltergeist?"
1,4,JERRY,"Hey, nobody's talking to you. Keep walking. Damn right it was a poltergeist, practically tore our house apart. Tell you something, if it wasn't for you and your dad, I probably wouldn't be alive. Your dad said you were off at college. Is that right?"
1,4,SAM,"Yeah, I was. I'm—taking some time off."
1,4,JERRY,"Well, he was real proud of you. I could tell. He talked about you all the time."
1,4,SAM,He did?
1,4,JERRY,"Yeah, you bet he did. Oh, hey, you know I tried to get a hold of him, but I couldn't. How's he doing, anyway?"
1,4,DEAN,"He's, um, wrapped up in a job right now."
1,4,JERRY,"Well, we're missing the old man, but we get Sam. Even trade, huh?"
1,4,SAM,"No, not by a long shot."
1,4,JERRY,I got something I want you guys to hear.
1,4,JERRY,"I listened to this. And, well, it sounded like it was up your alley."
1,4,JERRY,Normally I wouldn't have access to this. It's the cockpit voice recorder for United Britannia flight 2485. It was one of ours.
1,4,RECORDING,"Mayday! Mayday! Repeat! This is United Britania 2485—immediate instruction help! United Britanis 2485, I copy your message—May be experiencing some mechanical failure..."
1,4,JERRY,"Took off from here, crashed about two hundred miles south. Now, they're saying mechanical failure. Cabin depressurized somehow. Nobody knows why. Over a hundred people on board. Only seven got out alive. Pilot was one. His name is Chuck Lambert. He's a good friend of mine. Chuck is, uh...well, he's pretty broken up about it. Like it was his fault."
1,4,SAM,You don't think it was?
1,4,JERRY,"No, I don't."
1,4,SAM,"Jerry, we're gonna need passenger manifests, um, a list of survivors."
1,4,JERRY,All right.
1,4,DEAN,"And, uh, any way we can take a look at the wreckage?"
1,4,JERRY,"The other stuff is no problem. But the wreckage...fellas, the NTSB has it locked down in an evidence warehouse. No way I've got that kind of clearance."
1,4,DEAN,No problem.
1,4,WOMAN,Hey
1,4,DEAN,Hi.
1,4,SAM,You've been in there forever.
1,4,DEAN,You can't rush perfection.
1,4,SAM,Homeland Security?
1,4,SAM,"That's pretty illegal, even for us."
1,4,DEAN,"Yeah, well, it's something new. You know? People haven't seen it a thousand times."
1,4,DEAN,"All right, so, what do you got?"
1,4,SAM,"Well, there's definitely EVP on the cockpit voice recorder."
1,4,DEAN,Yeah?
1,4,SAM,Listen.
1,4,VOICE,No survivors!
1,4,DEAN,"""No survivors""? What's that supposed to mean? There were seven survivors."
1,4,SAM,Got me.
1,4,DEAN,"So, what are you thinking? A haunted flight?"
1,4,SAM,"There's a long history of spirits and death omens on planes and ships, like phantom travelers."
1,4,DEAN,Mm-hmm.
1,4,SAM,Or remember flight 401?
1,4,DEAN,"Right. The one that crashed, the airline salvaged some of its parts, put it in other planes, then the spirit of the pilot and copilot haunted those flights."
1,4,SAM,Right.
1,4,DEAN,Yep.
1,4,SAM,Maybe we got a similar deal.
1,4,DEAN,"All right, so, survivors, which one do you want to talk to first?"
1,4,SAM,Third on the list: Max Jaffey.
1,4,DEAN,Why him?
1,4,SAM,"Well, for one, he's from around here. And two, if anyone saw anything weird, he did."
1,4,DEAN,What makes you say that?
1,4,SAM,"Well, I spoke to his mother."
1,4,SAM (voiceover),And she told me where to find him.
1,4,MAX,I don't understand. I already spoke with Homeland Security.
1,4,DEAN,Right. Some new information has come up. So if you could just answer a couple questions...
1,4,SAM,"Just before the plane went down, did you notice anything...unusual?"
1,4,MAX,Like what?
1,4,DEAN,"Strange lights, weird noises, maybe. Voices."
1,4,MAX,"No, nothing."
1,4,DEAN,Mr. Joffey—
1,4,MAX,Jaffey.
1,4,DEAN,"Jaffey. You checked yourself in here, right?"
1,4,DEAN,Can I ask why?
1,4,MAX,I was a little stressed. I survived a plane crash.
1,4,DEAN,Uh huh. And that's what terrified you? That's what you were afraid of?
1,4,MAX,I...I don't want to talk about this anymore.
1,4,DEAN,"See, I think maybe you did see something up there. We need to know what."
1,4,MAX,"No. No, I was...delusional. Seeing things."
1,4,DEAN,He was seeing things.
1,4,DEAN,What?
1,4,MAX,"He opened the emergency exit. But that's...that's impossible, right? I mean, I looked it up. There's something like two tons of pressure on that door."
1,4,DEAN,Yeah.
1,4,SAM,"This man, uh, did he seem to appear and disappear rapidly? It would look something like a mirage?"
1,4,MAX,"What are you, nuts?"
1,4,MAX,He was a passenger. He was sitting right in front of me.
1,4,SAM,"So here we are. George Phelps, seat 20C."
1,4,DEAN,"Hmm. Man, I don't care how strong you are."
1,4,DEAN,"Even yoked up on PCP or something, no way you can open up an emergency door during a flight."
1,4,SAM,"Not if you're human. But maybe this guy George was something else. Some kind of creature, maybe, in human form."
1,4,DEAN,Does that look like a creature's lair to you?
1,4,SAM,This is your late husband?
1,4,MRS. PHELPS,"Yes, that was my George."
1,4,DEAN,And you said he was a...dentist?
1,4,MRS. PHELPS,Mm-hm. He was headed to a convention in Denver. Do you know that he was petrified to fly? For him to go like that...
1,4,SAM,How long were you married?
1,4,MRS. PHELPS,Thirteen years.
1,4,SAM,"In all that time, did you ever notice anything...strange about him, anything out of the ordinary?"
1,4,MRS. PHELPS,"Well...uh, he had acid reflux, if that's what you mean."
1,4,SAM,I mean it goes without saying. It just doesn't make any sense.
1,4,DEAN,"A middle-aged dentist with an ulcer is not exactly evil personified. You know what we need to do is get inside that NTSB warehouse, check out the wreckage."
1,4,SAM,"Okay. But if we're gonna go that route, we'd better look the part."
1,4,DEAN,"Man, I look like one of the Blues Brothers."
1,4,SAM,"No, you don't. You look more like a...seventh-grader at his first dance."
1,4,DEAN,I hate this thing.
1,4,SAM,Hey. You want into that warehouse or not?
1,4,SAM,What is that?
1,4,DEAN,It's an EMF meter. Reads electromagnetic frequencies.
1,4,SAM,"Yeah, I know what an EMF meter is, but why does that one look like a busted-up walkman?"
1,4,DEAN,'Cause that's what I made it out of. It's homemade.
1,4,SAM,"Yeah, I can see that."
1,4,DEAN,Check out the emergency door handle.
1,4,DEAN,What is this stuff?
1,4,SAM,One way to find out.
1,4,SECURITY GUARD,"Homeland Security? What, one team of you guys isn't enough?"
1,4,AGENT,What are you talking about?
1,4,SECURITY GUARD,Two of your buddies went inside not five minutes ago.
1,4,DEAN,"Well, these monkey suits do come in handy."
1,4,COPILOT,"Listen, Chuck. It's like getting back on a horse. Only in this case, a little twin engine. Not even a horse, more like a pony. I'll be right there with you too. Anytime you feel like you don't want the wheel, I'll take over. Look, Chuck, we don't have to do this today. I'm not trying to rush you."
1,4,CHUCK,"No, the...the waiting is worse."
1,4,COPILOT,"Okay, they're filling up the tank. Then we go."
1,4,JERRY,Huh. This stuff is covered in sulfur.
1,4,SAM,You're sure?
1,4,JERRY,Take a look for yourself.
1,4,MAN,You effin' piece of crap...
1,4,JERRY,"If you fellows will excuse me, I have an idiot to fire."
1,4,JERRY,"Hey. Einstein. Yeah, you. What the heck you doing? Put the wrench down—"
1,4,DEAN,"Hmm. You know, there's not too many things that leave behind a sulfuric residue."
1,4,SAM,Demonic possession?
1,4,DEAN,It would explain how a mortal man would have the strength to open up an emergency hatch.
1,4,SAM,"If the guy was possessed, it's possible."
1,4,DEAN,"This goes way beyond floating over a bed or barfing pea soup. I mean it's one thing to possess a person, but to use them to take down an entire airplane?"
1,4,SAM,You ever heard of something like this before?
1,4,DEAN,Never.
1,4,CHUCK,I'm ready. Let's do this.
1,4,COPILOT,How you feeling?
1,4,CHUCK,I feel great.
1,4,COPILOT,You'll be back flying jumbos before you know it.
1,4,CHUCK,I hope so. How long we been up?
1,4,COPILOT,Uh...almost forty minutes.
1,4,CHUCK,Wow. Time really does fly.
1,4,COPILOT,What are you doing?
1,4,SAM,"So, every religion in every world culture has the concept of demons and demonic possession, right? I mean Christian, Native American, Hindu, you name it."
1,4,DEAN,"Yeah, but none of them describe anything like this."
1,4,SAM,"Well, that's not exactly true. You see according to Japanese beliefs, certain demons are behind certain disasters, both natural and man-made. One causes earthquakes, another causes disease."
1,4,DEAN,And this one causes plane crashes?
1,4,DEAN,"All right, so, what? We have a demon that's evolved with the times and found a way to ratchet up the body count?"
1,4,SAM,"Yeah. You know, who knows how many planes it's brought down before this one?"
1,4,SAM,What?
1,4,DEAN,"I don't know, man. This isn't our normal gig. I mean, demons, they don't want anything, just death and destruction for its own sake. This is big. And I wish Dad was here."
1,4,SAM,Yeah. Me too.
1,4,DEAN,Hello?
1,4,JERRY,"Dean, it's Jerry."
1,4,DEAN,"Oh, hey, Jerry."
1,4,JERRY,My pilot friend...Chuck Lambert is dead.
1,4,DEAN,"Wha—Jerry, I'm sorry. What happened?"
1,4,JERRY,He and his buddy went up in a small twin about an hour ago. The plane went down.
1,4,DEAN,Where'd this happen?
1,4,JERRY,"About sixty miles west of here, near Nazareth."
1,4,DEAN,I'll try to ignore the irony in that.
1,4,JERRY,I'm sorry?
1,4,DEAN,"Nothing. Jerry, hang in there, all right? We'll catch up with you soon."
1,4,SAM,Another crash?
1,4,DEAN,Yeah. Let's go.
1,4,SAM,Where?
1,4,DEAN,Nazareth.
1,4,DEAN,Sulfur?
1,4,DEAN,"Well, that's great. All right, that's two plane crashes involving Chuck Lambert. This demon sounds like it was after him."
1,4,SAM,"With all due respect to Chuck, if that's the case, that would be the good news."
1,4,DEAN,What's the bad news?
1,4,SAM,"Chuck's plane went down exactly forty minutes into flight. And get this, so did flight 2485."
1,4,JERRY,Forty minutes? What does that mean?
1,4,DEAN,"It's biblical numerology. You know Noah's ark, it rained for forty days. The number means death."
1,4,SAM,"I went back, and there have been six plane crashes over the last decade that all went down exactly forty minutes in."
1,4,DEAN,Any survivors?
1,4,SAM,"No. Or not until now, at least, not until flight 2485, for some reason. On the cockpit voice recorder, remember what the EVP Said?"
1,4,DEAN,"""No survivors."""
1,4,DEAN,It's going after all the survivors. It's trying to finish the job.
1,4,SAM,"Really? Well, thank you for taking our survey, And if you do plan to fly, please don't forget your friends at United Britannia Airlines. Thanks."
1,4,SAM,All right. That takes care of Blaine Sanderson and Dennis Holloway. They're not flying anytime soon.
1,4,DEAN,So our only wildcard is the flight attendant Amanda Walker.
1,4,SAM,Right. Her sister Karen said her flight leaves Indianapolis at eight pm. It's her first night back on the job.
1,4,DEAN,That sounds like just our luck.
1,4,SAM,"Dean, this is a five-hour drive, man, even with you behind the wheel."
1,4,DEAN,"Call Amanda's cellphone again, see if we can't head her off at the pass."
1,4,SAM,I already left her three voice messages. She must have turned her cellphone off.
1,4,SAM,"God, we're never gonna make it."
1,4,DEAN,We'll make it.
1,4,SAM,Right there. They're boarding in thirty minutes.
1,4,DEAN,Okay. We still have some cards to play. We need to find a phone.
1,4,VOICE,Airport Services.
1,4,DEAN,Hi. Gate thirteen.
1,4,VOICE,"Who are you calling, sir?"
1,4,DEAN,"I'm trying to contact an Amanda Walker. She's a flight attendant on flight, um...flight 4-2-4."
1,4,PA VOICE,"Amanda Walker, Amanda Walker, you have a phone call. White courtesy phone, gate thirteen."
1,4,DEAN,Come on.
1,4,AMANDA,This is Amanda Walker.
1,4,DEAN,"Miss Walker. Hi, this is Dr. James Hetfield from St. Francis Memorial Hospital. We have a Karen Walker here."
1,4,AMANDA,Karen?
1,4,DEAN,"Nothing serious, just a minor car accident, but she was injured, so—"
1,4,AMANDA,"Wa—wait, that's impossible. I just got off the phone with her."
1,4,DEAN,You what?
1,4,AMANDA,"Five minutes ago. She's at her house, cramming for a final. Who is this?"
1,4,DEAN,"Uh, well...there must be some mistake."
1,4,AMANDA,And how would you even know I was here?
1,4,AMANDA,Is this one of Vince's friends?
1,4,DEAN,Guilty as charged.
1,4,AMANDA,Wow. This is unbelievable.
1,4,DEAN,He's really sorry.
1,4,AMANDA,"Well, you tell him to mind his own business and stay out of my life, okay?"
1,4,DEAN,"Yes, but...he really needs to see you tonight, so—"
1,4,AMANDA,"No, I'm sorry. It's too late."
1,4,DEAN,Don't be like that. Come on. The guy's a mess. Really. It's pathetic.
1,4,AMANDA,Really?
1,4,DEAN,"Oh, yeah."
1,4,AMANDA,"Look, I've got to go. Um...tell him to call me when I land."
1,4,DEAN,"No, no. Wait, Amanda. Amanda!"
1,4,AMANDA,"How are you? Hey, Bob."
1,4,DEAN,Damn it! So close.
1,4,INTERCOM,Thank you for flying United Britannia Airlines.
1,4,SAM,"All right, it's time for plan B. We're getting on that plane."
1,4,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, now just hold on a second."
1,4,SAM,"Dean, that plane is leaving with over a hundred passengers on board, and if we're right, that plane is gonna crash."
1,4,DEAN,I know.
1,4,SAM,"Okay. So we're getting on the plane, we need to find that demon and exorcise it. I'll get the tickets. You get whatever you can out of the trunk. Whatever that will make it through the security. Meet me back here in five minutes."
1,4,SAM,Are you okay?
1,4,DEAN,"No, not really."
1,4,SAM,What? What's wrong?
1,4,DEAN,"Well, I kind of have this problem with, uh..."
1,4,SAM,Flying?
1,4,DEAN,It's never really been an issue until now.
1,4,SAM,"You're joking, right?"
1,4,DEAN,"Do I look like I'm joking? Why do you think I drive everywhere, Sam?"
1,4,SAM,"All right. Uh, I'll go."
1,4,DEAN,What?
1,4,SAM,I'll do this one on my own.
1,4,DEAN,"What are you, nuts? You said it yourself, the plane's gonna crash."
1,4,SAM,"Dean, we can do it together, or I can do this one by myself. I'm not seeing a third option, here."
1,4,DEAN,Come on! Really? Man...
1,4,INTERCOM,"Flight attendants, please cross-check doors before departure."
1,4,SAM,Just try to relax.
1,4,DEAN,Just try to shut up.
1,4,SAM,You're humming Metallica?
1,4,DEAN,Calms me down.
1,4,SAM,"Look, man, I get you're nervous, all right? But you got to stay focused."
1,4,DEAN,Okay.
1,4,SAM,"I mean, we got thirty-two minutes and counting to track this thing down, or whoever it's possessing, anyway, and perform a full-on exorcism."
1,4,DEAN,"Yeah, on a crowded plane. That's gonna be easy."
1,4,SAM,"Just take it one step at a time, all right? Now, who is it possessing?"
1,4,DEAN,"It's usually gonna be somebody with some sort of weakness, you know, a chink in the armor that the demon can worm through. Somebody with an addiction or some sort of emotional distress."
1,4,SAM,"Well, this is Amanda's first flight after the crash. If I were her, I'd be pretty messed up."
1,4,DEAN,Excuse me. Are you Amanda?
1,4,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,"No, I'm not."
1,4,DEAN,"Oh, my mistake."
1,4,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,Mm-hm.
1,4,DEAN,"All right, well, that's got to be Amanda back there, so I'll go talk to her, and, uh, I'll get a read on her mental state."
1,4,SAM,What if she's already possessed?
1,4,DEAN,There's ways to test that.
1,4,DEAN,I brought holy water.
1,4,SAM,No.
1,4,SAM,"I think we can go more subtle. If she's possessed, she'll flinch at the name of God."
1,4,DEAN,Oh. Nice.
1,4,SAM,Hey.
1,4,DEAN,What?
1,4,SAM,Say it in Latin.
1,4,DEAN,I know.
1,4,SAM,Okay. Hey!
1,4,DEAN,What?!
1,4,SAM,"Uh, in Latin, it's ""Christo""."
1,4,DEAN,"Dude, I know! I'm not an idiot!"
1,4,COPILOT,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your first officer speaking..."
1,4,DEAN,Hi.
1,4,AMANDA,Hi. Can I help you with something?
1,4,DEAN,"Oh, no. I'm just a bit of an uneasy flier. It makes me feel better to walk around a little bit."
1,4,AMANDA,"Oh, it happens to the best of us."
1,4,DEAN,"Of course, you being a stewardess, I guess flying comes easy to you."
1,4,AMANDA,You'd be surprised.
1,4,DEAN,Really? You're a nervous flier?
1,4,AMANDA,"Yeah, maybe, little bit."
1,4,DEAN,"How is it that, being a stewardess, you're scared to fly?"
1,4,AMANDA,Kind of a long story.
1,4,DEAN,Right. I'm sorry for asking.
1,4,AMANDA,It's okay.
1,4,DEAN,You ever consider other employment?
1,4,AMANDA,"No. Look, everybody's scared of something. I just, uh...I'm not gonna let it hold me back."
1,4,DEAN,Huh.
1,4,AMANDA,So...
1,4,"DEAN, quietly",Christo.
1,4,AMANDA,I'm sorry. Did you say something?
1,4,DEAN,Christo?
1,4,AMANDA,"I—I didn't, I didn't..."
1,4,DEAN,"Yeah, nothing. Never mind."
1,4,AMANDA,Okay.
1,4,DEAN,"All right, well, she's got to be the most well-adjusted person on the planet."
1,4,SAM,"You said ""Christo""?"
1,4,DEAN,Yeah.
1,4,SAM,And?
1,4,DEAN,There's no demon in her. There's no demon getting in her.
1,4,SAM,"So, if it's on the plane, it can be anyone. Anywhere."
1,4,DEAN,Come on! That can't be normal!
1,4,SAM,"Hey, hey, it's just a little turbulence."
1,4,DEAN,"Sam, this plane is going to crash, okay? So quit treating me like I'm friggin' four."
1,4,SAM,You need to calm down.
1,4,DEAN,"Well, I'm sorry I can't."
1,4,SAM,"Yes, you can."
1,4,DEAN,"Dude, stow the touchy-feely, self-help yoga crap, it's not helping."
1,4,SAM,"Listen, if you're panicked, you're wide open to demonic possession, so you need to calm yourself down. Right now."
1,4,SAM,"Good. Now, I found an exorcism in here that I think is gonna work. The Rituale Romanum."
1,4,DEAN,What do we have to do?
1,4,SAM,"It's two parts. The first part expels the demon from the victim's body. It makes it manifest, which actually makes it more powerful."
1,4,DEAN,More powerful?
1,4,SAM,Yeah.
1,4,DEAN,How?
1,4,SAM,"Well, it doesn't need to possess someone anymore. It can just wreak havoc on its own."
1,4,DEAN,Oh. And why is that a good thing?
1,4,SAM,"Well, because the second part sends the bastard back to hell once and for all."
1,4,DEAN,"First things first, we got to find it."
1,4,DEAN,Ah! Don't do that.
1,4,SAM,Anything?
1,4,DEAN,"No, nothing. How much time we got?"
1,4,SAM,Fifteen minutes. Maybe we missed somebody.
1,4,DEAN,Maybe the thing's just not on the plane.
1,4,SAM,You believe that?
1,4,DEAN,"Well, I will if you will."
1,4,SAM,What? What is it?
1,4,DEAN,Christo.
1,4,SAM,She's not gonna believe this.
1,4,DEAN,"Twelve minutes, dude."
1,4,AMANDA,"Oh, hi. Flight's not too bumpy for you, I hope."
1,4,DEAN,"Actually, that's kind of what we need to talk to you about."
1,4,AMANDA,"Um, okay. What can I do for you?"
1,4,DEAN,"All right, this is gonna sound nuts, but we just don't have time for the whole ""the truth is out there"" speech right now."
1,4,SAM,"All right, look, we know you were on flight 2485."
1,4,AMANDA,Who are you guys?
1,4,SAM,"Now, we've spoken to some of the other survivors. We know something brought down that plane and it wasn't a mechanical failure."
1,4,DEAN,We need your help because we need to stop it from happening again. Here. Now.
1,4,AMANDA,"I'm sorry, I—I'm very busy. I have to go back—"
1,4,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? But listen to me, uh...The pilot in 2485, Chuck Lambert. He's dead."
1,4,AMANDA,"Wait. What? What, Chuck is dead?"
1,4,DEAN,"He died in a plane crash. Now, that's two plane crashes in two months. That doesn't strike you as strange?"
1,4,AMANDA,I—
1,4,SAM,"Look, there was something wrong with 2485. Now maybe you sensed it, maybe you didn't. But there's something wrong with this flight, too."
1,4,DEAN,"Amanda, you have to believe us."
1,4,AMANDA,"On...on 2485, there was this man. He...had these eyes."
1,4,SAM,Yes. That's exactly what we're talking about.
1,4,AMANDA,"I don't understand, what are you asking me to do?"
1,4,DEAN,"Okay. The copilot, we need you to bring him back here."
1,4,AMANDA,Why? What does he have to do with anything?
1,4,DEAN,Don't have time to explain. We just need to talk to him. Okay?
1,4,AMANDA,How am I supposed to go in the cockpit and get the copilot—
1,4,SAM,"Do whatever it takes. Tell him there's something broken back here, whatever will get him out of that cockpit."
1,4,AMANDA,Do you know that I could lose my job if you—
1,4,DEAN,"Okay, well you're gonna lose a lot more if you don't help us out."
1,4,AMANDA,Okay.
1,4,COPILOT,"Yeah, what's the problem?"
1,4,AMANDA,Wait. What are you doing? You said you were just gonna talk to him.
1,4,DEAN,We are gonna talk to him.
1,4,AMANDA,"Oh, my god. What's wrong with him?"
1,4,SAM,Look. We need you calm. We need you outside the curtain.
1,4,AMANDA,"Well, I don't underst—I don't know—"
1,4,SAM,"Don't let anybody in, okay? Can you do that? Can you do that? Amanda?"
1,4,AMANDA,Okay. Okay.
1,4,DEAN,"Hurry up, Sam. I don't know how much longer I can hold him."
1,4,SAM,"Regna terrae, cantate Deo, psallite Domino—"
1,4,DEMON,"I know what happened to your girlfriend! She must have died screaming! Even now, she's burning!"
1,4,DEAN,Sam!
1,4,SAM,I got him.
1,4,SAM,Where'd it go?
1,4,DEAN,It's in the plane. Hurry up. We got to finish it.
1,4,FAA AGENT,"Sir, can you tell me what happened?"
1,4,COPILOT,"I don't know. I was walking through the airport, then it all goes blank. I don't even remember getting on the plane."
1,4,FBI AGENT,Anything else?
1,4,AMANDA,"No, that's all."
1,4,DEAN,Let's get out of here.
1,4,DEAN,You okay?
1,4,SAM,"Dean, it knew about Jessica."
1,4,DEAN,"Sam, these things, they, they read minds. They lie. All right? That's all it was."
1,4,SAM,Yeah.
1,4,DEAN,Come on.
1,4,JERRY,Your dad's gonna be real proud.
1,4,SAM,"We'll see you around, Jerry."
1,4,DEAN,"You know, Jerry."
1,4,JERRY,Yeah.
1,4,DEAN,"I meant to ask you, how did you get my cellphone number, anyway? I've only had it for like six months."
1,4,JERRY,Your dad gave it to me.
1,4,SAM,What?
1,4,DEAN,When did you talk to him?
1,4,JERRY,"I mean, I didn't exactly talk to him, but I called his number. His voice message said to give you a call. Thanks again, guys."
1,4,SAM,"This doesn't make any sense, man. I've called Dad's number like fifty times. It's been out of service."
1,4,JOHN,"This is John Winchester. I can't be reached. If this is an emergency, call my son, Dean. 785-555-0179. He can help."
1,4,SAM,"Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa."
1,4,SAM,Dean. We're about to walk into an airport?
1,4,DEAN,I feel naked.
1,5,JOHN,"Take your brother outside as fast as you can! Now, Dean, go!"
1,5,JOHN,Mary! No!
1,5,DEAN,Dad's on a hunting trip.
1,5,DEAN,And he hasn't been home in a few days.
1,5,SAM,I swore I was done hunting.
1,5,DEAN,I can't do this alone.
1,5,SAM,No!
1,5,SAM,We've got work to do.
1,5,DEAN,—most valuable possession—everything he knows about every evil thing is in here. I think he wants us to—
1,5,DEAN,The family business.
1,5,SAM,No. I gotta find Jessica's killer.
1,5,DEAN,"SAM, you know we're gonna find Dad, right?"
1,5,SAM,Yeah. I know.
1,5,GIRL 1,"Okay, your turn, truth or dare?"
1,5,LILY,Truth.
1,5,GIRL 1,Do you want to make out with Benji Swartz?
1,5,LILY,Dare.
1,5,GIRL 1,"Okay, lame. You have to...say ""Bloody Mary"" in the bathroom."
1,5,LILY,Is that the best you can come up with?
1,5,GIRL 2,Who's Bloody Mary?
1,5,GIRL 1,She's this witch.
1,5,LILY,I heard she was a lady killed in a car crash.
1,5,GIRL 1,"It doesn't matter who she is. Point is, if you say her name three times in the bathroom mirror she appears...and scratches your eyes out!"
1,5,GIRL 2,So why would anyone say it?
1,5,LILY,Because it isn't real.
1,5,GIRL 1,"No turning on the lights, and remember...three times."
1,5,LILY,Bloody Mary. This is so stupid. Bloody Mary.
1,5,LILY,Bloody Mary.
1,5,GIRL 1,Scared ya.
1,5,LILY,You guys are jerks.
1,5,STEVEN,Lily.
1,5,STEVEN,Do you mind keeping it down?
1,5,LILY,"Sorry, Daddy."
1,5,GIRL 2,You so like him!
1,5,DONNA,"Hey, geek. You guys having fun?"
1,5,LILY,You're out past curfew.
1,5,DONNA,"Thanks, Dad."
1,5,JESS,"Why, Sam? Why, Sam?"
1,5,SAM,No!
1,5,JESS,"Why, Sam? Why, Sam?"
1,5,DEAN,"Sam, wake up."
1,5,SAM,I take it I was having a nightmare.
1,5,DEAN,"Yeah, another one."
1,5,SAM,"Hey, at least I got some sleep."
1,5,DEAN,"You know, sooner or later we're gonna have to talk about this."
1,5,SAM,Are we here?
1,5,DEAN,"Yup. Welcome to Toledo, Ohio."
1,5,SAM,So what do you think really happened to this guy?
1,5,DEAN,That's what we're gonna find out.
1,5,DEAN,Let's go.
1,5,MORGUE TECH,Hey.
1,5,DEAN,Hey.
1,5,MORGUE TECH,Can I help you?
1,5,DEAN,"Yeah. We're the, uh...med students."
1,5,MORGUE TECH,Sorry?
1,5,DEAN,"Oh, Doctor—"
1,5,DEAN,—Figlavitch didn't tell you?
1,5,DEAN,"We talked to him on the phone. He, uh, we're from Ohio State."
1,5,DEAN,He's supposed to show us the Shoemaker corpse. It's for our paper.
1,5,MORGUE TECH,"Well, I'm sorry, he's at lunch."
1,5,DEAN,"Oh well he said, uh—"
1,5,DEAN,"—oh, well, you know, it doesn't matter. You don't mind just showing us the body, do you?"
1,5,MORGUE TECH,"Sorry, I can't."
1,5,MORGUE TECH,Doc will be back in an hour. You can wait for him if you want.
1,5,DEAN,An hour? Ooh. We gotta be heading back to Columbus by then.
1,5,SAM,Yeah.
1,5,DEAN,"Uh, look, man, this paper's like half our grade, so if you don't mind helping us out—"
1,5,MORGUE TECH,"Uh, look, man...no."
1,5,DEAN,I'm gonna hit him in his face I swear.
1,5,MORGUE TECH,Follow me.
1,5,DEAN,"Dude, I earned that money."
1,5,SAM,You won it in a poker game.
1,5,DEAN,Yeah.
1,5,SAM,Now the newspaper said his daughter found him. She said his eyes were bleeding.
1,5,MORGUE TECH,More than that. They practically liquefied.
1,5,DEAN,Any sign of a struggle? Maybe somebody did it to him?
1,5,MORGUE TECH,"Nope. Besides the daughter, he was all alone."
1,5,SAM,What's the official cause of death.
1,5,MORGUE TECH,"Ah, Doc's not sure. He's thinking massive stroke, maybe an aneurysm? Something burst up in there, that's for sure."
1,5,SAM,What do you mean?
1,5,MORGUE TECH,Intense cerebral bleeding. This guy had more blood in his skull than anyone I've ever seen.
1,5,SAM,The eyes&mash;what would cause something like that?
1,5,MORGUE TECH,Capillaries can burst. See a lot of bloodshot eyes with stroke victims.
1,5,DEAN,Yeah? You ever see exploding eyeballs?
1,5,MORGUE TECH,"That's a first for me, but hey, I'm not the doctor."
1,5,DEAN,"Hey, think we could take a look at that police report? You know for, uh...our paper."
1,5,MORGUE TECH,I'm not really supposed to show you that.
1,5,SAM,Might not be one of ours. Might just be some freak medical thing.
1,5,DEAN,How many times in Dad's long and varied career has it actually been a freak medical thing and not some sign of an awful supernatural death?
1,5,SAM,"Uh, almost never."
1,5,DEAN,Exactly.
1,5,SAM,"All right, let's go talk to the daughter."
1,5,DEAN,Feel like we're underdressed.
1,5,DEAN,"You must be Donna, right?"
1,5,DONNA,Yeah.
1,5,SAM,"Hi, uh—we're really sorry."
1,5,DONNA,Thank you.
1,5,SAM,"I'm Sam, this is Dean. We worked with your dad."
1,5,DONNA,You did?
1,5,DEAN,"Yeah. This whole thing. I mean, a stroke."
1,5,CHARLIE,I don't think she really wants to talk about this right now
1,5,DONNA,It's okay. I'm okay.
1,5,DEAN,Were there any symptoms? Dizziness? Migraines?
1,5,DONNA,No.
1,5,LILY,That's because it wasn't a stroke.
1,5,DONNA,"Lily, don't say that."
1,5,SAM,What?
1,5,DONNA,"I'm sorry, she's just upset."
1,5,LILY,"No, it happened because of me."
1,5,DONNA,"Sweetie, it didn't."
1,5,SAM,Lily.
1,5,SAM,Why would you say something like that?
1,5,LILY,"Right before he died, I said it."
1,5,SAM,You said what?
1,5,LILY,"Bloody Mary, three times in the bathroom mirror."
1,5,LILY,"She took his eyes, that's what she does."
1,5,DONNA,That's not why Dad died. This isn't your fault.
1,5,DEAN,"I think your sister's right, Lily. There's no way it could have been Bloody Mary. Your dad didn't say it, did he?"
1,5,LILY,"No, I don't think so."
1,5,SAM,The Bloody Mary legend...Dad ever find any evidence that it was a real thing?
1,5,DEAN,Not that I know of.
1,5,SAM,"I mean, everywhere else all over the country, kids will play Bloody Mary, and as far as we know, nobody dies from it."
1,5,DEAN,"Yeah, well, maybe everywhere it's just a story, but here it's actually happening."
1,5,SAM,The place where the legend began?
1,5,SAM,"But according to the legend, the person who says B—"
1,5,SAM,The person who says you know what gets it. But here—
1,5,DEAN,"Shoemaker gets it instead, yeah."
1,5,SAM,Right.
1,5,DEAN,"Never heard anything like that before. Still, the guy did die right in front of the mirror, and the daughter's right. The way the legend goes, you know who scratches your eyes out."
1,5,SAM,It's worth checking in to.
1,5,CHARLIE,What are you doing up here?
1,5,DEAN,"We—we, had to go to the bathroom."
1,5,CHARLIE,Who are you?
1,5,DEAN,"Like we said downstairs, we worked with Donna's dad."
1,5,CHARLIE,He was a day trader or something. He worked by himself.
1,5,DEAN,"No, I know, I meant—"
1,5,CHARLIE,"And all those weird questions downstairs, what was that? So you tell me what's going on, or I start screaming."
1,5,SAM,"All right, all right. We think something happened to Donna's dad."
1,5,CHARLIE,"Yeah, a stroke."
1,5,SAM,That's not a sign of a typical stroke. We think it might be something else.
1,5,CHARLIE,Like what?
1,5,SAM,Honestly? We don't know yet. But we don't want it to happen to anyone else. That's the truth.
1,5,DEAN,"So, if you're gonna scream, go right ahead."
1,5,CHARLIE,"Who are you, cops?"
1,5,DEAN,Something like that.
1,5,SAM,I'll tell you what. Here.
1,5,SAM,"If you think of anything, you or your friends notice anything strange, out of the ordinary...just give us a call."
1,5,DEAN,"All right, say Bloody Mary really is haunting this town. There's gonna be some sort of proof—Like a local woman who died nasty."
1,5,SAM,"Yeah but a legend this widespread it's hard. I mean, there's like 50 versions of who she actually is. One story says she's a witch, another says she's a mutilated bride, there's a lot more. {They walk in to the actual library.}"
1,5,DEAN,All right so what are we supposed to be looking for?
1,5,SAM,"Every version's got a few things in common. It's always a woman named Mary, and she always dies right in front of a mirror. So we've gotta search local newspapers—public records as far back as they go. See if we can find a Mary who fits the bill."
1,5,DEAN,Well that sounds annoying.
1,5,SAM,"No it won't be so bad, as long as we...{He looks at the computers which all say ""Out of Order"" on them.} *chuckles* I take it back. This will be very annoying."
1,5,Charlie,I'm not sure. They were cops or detectives or something.
1,5,Jill,"Whoever they were, they were cute."
1,5,Charlie,Jill
1,5,Jill,You didn't think so?
1,5,Charlie,"Yeah okay they were cute. Still, do you think something happened to DONNA's dad?"
1,5,Jill,Maybe LILY was right. Maybe Bloody Mary got him.
1,5,Charlie,"Ha ha, very funny."
1,5,Jill,"Wait, I'm sorry. Was that fear I hear in your voice?"
1,5,Charlie,No.
1,5,Jill,"Charlie, I'm walking to the bathroom mirror right now."
1,5,Charlie,"Jill, quit it."
1,5,Jill,"{She gets to her bathroom mirror.} Oh no, I can't help myself. I'm gonna say it. Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary."
1,5,Charlie,{There is a silence on the phone.} Jill? {Jill screams.} Jill!?!
1,5,Jill,"{Starts laughing} You're such a freak, I'll call you tomorrow. {They hang up the phone and Jill goes to her closet to finish getting changed. She opens the door, and on the inside there is a mirror, where we see Bloody Mary. She closes the closet door and goes to sit down at her vanity, where of course there is another mirror. We see Bloody Mary as she takes her earrings out, and then her reflection again when Jill walks in front of her TV screen. Jill goes back in the bathroom to wash her face, but as she bends down to wash, her reflection in the mirror stays standing. She looks up and sees her reflection looking at her as if it were another person. Jill starts panicking as the reflection in the mirror starts oozing blood out of its eyes. She reaches up and feels blood on her own face.}"
1,5,Reflection,You did it. You killed that boy.
1,5,SAM,Why'd you let me fall asleep?
1,5,DEAN,Cause I'm an awesome brother. So what did you dream about?
1,5,SAM,Lollipops and candy canes.
1,5,DEAN,"Yeah, sure."
1,5,SAM,Did you find anything?
1,5,DEAN,"Oh besides a whole new level of frustration? {SAM sits up.} No. I've looked at everything. A few local women, a Laura and a Catherine committed suicide in front of a mirror, and a giant mirror fell on a guy named Dave, but uh, no Mary."
1,5,SAM,{Falls back on the bed.} Maybe we just haven't found it yet.
1,5,DEAN,"I've also been searching for strange deaths in the area, you know...eyeball bleeding, that sort of thing. There's nothing. Whatever's happening here, maybe it just ain't Mary."
1,5,SAM,"Hello? {We do not hear who is calling, but a look of concern comes across SAM's face.}"
1,5,Charlie,And they found her on the bathroom floor. And her—her eyes. They were gone.
1,5,SAM,I'm sorry.
1,5,Charlie,"And she said it. {DEAN looks up at SAM.} I heard her say it. But it couldn't be because of that. I'm insane, right?"
1,5,DEAN,"No, you're not insane."
1,5,Charlie,"Oh God, that makes me feel so much worse."
1,5,SAM,Look. We think something's happening here. Something that can't be explained.
1,5,DEAN,And we're gonna stop it but we could use your help.
1,5,SAM,What did you tell Jill's mom?
1,5,Charlie,Just that I needed some time alone with Jill's pictures and things. {SAM pulls something out of the bag and DEAN shuts the curtains.} I hate lying to her.
1,5,DEAN,"Trust us, this is for the greater good. Hit the lights."
1,5,Charlie,{goes over to turn off the lights.} What are you guys looking for?
1,5,DEAN,We'll let you know as soon as we find it.
1,5,SAM,"{has a digital camera ready, and hands it to DEAN.} Hey, night vision. {DEAN turns on the night vision for him.} Perfect."
1,5,DEAN,Do I look like Paris Hilton?
1,5,SAM,"So I don't get it. I mean...the first victim didn't summon Mary, and the second victim did. How's she choosing them?"
1,5,DEAN,Beats me.
1,5,DEAN,I want to know why Jill said it in the first place.
1,5,Charlie,It's just a joke.
1,5,DEAN,"Yeah well somebody's gonna say it again, it's just a matter of time."
1,5,SAM,"Hey. {DEAN and Charlie turn to look at him.} There's a black light in the trunk, right?"
1,5,Charlie,Gary Bryman?
1,5,SAM,You know who that is?
1,5,Charlie,No.
1,5,SAM,"So, Gary Bryman was an 8-year-old boy. Two years ago he was killed in a hit and run. The car was described as a black Toyota Camry. But nobody got the plates or saw the driver."
1,5,Charlie,Oh my God.
1,5,SAM,What?
1,5,Charlie,Jill drove that car.
1,5,DEAN,We need to get back to your friend DONNA's house.
1,5,SAM,Linda Shoemaker.
1,5,DONNA,Why are you asking me this?
1,5,SAM,"Look, we're sorry, but it's important."
1,5,DONNA,"Yeah. Linda's my mom okay? She overdosed on sleeping pills, it was an accident, and that's it. I think you should leave."
1,5,DEAN,"Now DONNA, just listen."
1,5,DONNA,Get out of my house! {she runs upstairs.}
1,5,Charlie,Oh my God. Do you really think her dad could've killed her mom?
1,5,SAM,Maybe.
1,5,Charlie,I think I should stick around.
1,5,DEAN,"All right. Whatever you do, don't—"
1,5,Charlie,"Believe me, I won't say it."
1,5,SAM,"Wait, wait, wait, you're doing a nationwide search?"
1,5,DEAN,"Yep. The NCIC, the FBI database—at this point any Mary who died in front of a mirror is good enough for me."
1,5,SAM,"But if she's haunting the town, she should have died in the town."
1,5,DEAN,"I'm telling you there's nothing local, I've checked. So unless you got a better idea—"
1,5,SAM,"The way Mary's choosing her victims, it seems like there's a pattern."
1,5,DEAN,"I know, I was thinking the SAMe thing."
1,5,SAM,With mister Shoemaker and Jill's hit and run.
1,5,DEAN,Both had secrets where people died.
1,5,SAM,"Right. I mean there's a lot of folklore about mirrors-that they reveal all your lies, all your secrets, that they're a true reflection of your soul, which is why it's bad luck to break them."
1,5,DEAN,"Right, right. So maybe if you've got a secret, I mean like a really nasty one where someone died, then Mary sees it, and punishes you for it."
1,5,SAM,Whether you're the one that summoned her or not.
1,5,DEAN,"Take a look at this. {Cut to a picture of a woman lying by a mirror in a puddle of blood. DEAN prints out another picture and hands it to SAM. The picture is of a handprint and the letters ""Tre""}"
1,5,SAM,Looks like the SAMe handprint.
1,5,DEAN,"Her name was Mary Worthington—an unsolved murder in Fort Wayne, Indiana."
1,5,Detective,"I was on the job for 35 years-detective for most of that. Now everybody packs it in with a few loose ends, but the Mary Worthington murder—that one still gets me."
1,5,DEAN,What exactly happened?
1,5,Detective,You boys said you were reporters?
1,5,SAM,"We know Mary was 19, lived by herself. We know she won a few local beauty contests, dreamt of getting out of Indiana, being an actress. And we know the night of March 29th someone broke into her apartment and murdered her, cut out her eyes with a knife."
1,5,Detective,That's right.
1,5,SAM,"See sir, when we asked you what happened, we wanted to know what you think happened."
1,5,Detective,Technically I'm not supposed to have a copy of this. {He opens a file to the picture SAM and DEAN found on the computer.} Now see that there? T-R-E?
1,5,DEAN,Yeah.
1,5,Detective,I think Mary was trying to spell out the name of her killer.
1,5,SAM,You know who it was?
1,5,Detective,"Not for sure. But there was a local man, a surgeon-Trevor SAMpson. {He pulls out a picture of a man.} And I think her cut her up good."
1,5,SAM,Now why would he do something like that?
1,5,Detective,"Her diary mentioned a man that she was seeing. She called him by his initial, ""T"". Well, her last entry, she was gonna tell ""T""'s wife about their affair."
1,5,DEAN,Yeah but how do you know it was SAMpson who killed her?
1,5,Detective,"It's hard to say, but the way her eyes were cut out...it was almost professional."
1,5,DEAN,But you could never prove it?
1,5,Detective,"No. No prints, no witnesses. He was meticulous."
1,5,DEAN,Is he still alive?
1,5,Detective,"Nope. {sits down and sighs} If you ask me, Mary spent her last living moments trying to expose this guy's secret. But she never could."
1,5,SAM,Where's she buried?
1,5,Detective,She wasn't. She was cremated.
1,5,DEAN,What about that mirror {nods at the one in the picture}. It's not in some evidence lockup somewhere is it?
1,5,Detective,"Ah, no. It was returned to Mary's family a long time ago."
1,5,SAM,You have the names of her family by any chance?
1,5,DONNA,"I mean, you bring these strangers into my house and they ask me things like that?"
1,5,Charlie,"They were only trying to help. Please, DONNA, you have to believe me."
1,5,DONNA,What? About Bloody Mary? {Of course they have now stopped in front of the mirror.}
1,5,Charlie,"Please, I know it sounds crazy—"
1,5,DONNA,"Crazy doesn't even begin to cover it. I mean it's one thing for my sister to believe this crap, she's 12. But you?"
1,5,Charlie,"Think about the way your dad died, okay? And the way Jill died."
1,5,DONNA,Okay so {she turns to face the mirror} Bloody Mary.
1,5,Charlie,No!
1,5,DONNA,Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. {She turns back to face Charlie} See? Nothing happened.
1,5,Charlie,Why would you do that?
1,5,DONNA,Oh my God. There really is something wrong with you.
1,5,Teacher,"Elements that loose electrons become positive ions, which are smaller than other atoms of the SAMe element. {Charlie opens up her compact.} Therefore the ionic radius is smaller than the atomic radius. {Charlie sees Bloody Mary in the corner and screams. The class freaks out as she starts running around the room.} Charlie! {She sees the reflection of Mary in the window of the door, picks up a stool, and throws it through the window.} Charlie!!! {The teacher catches Charlie.} Charlie stop it! What's wrong!? Just calm down.{Charlie sees Mary in the reflection of the teacher's glasses.}"
1,5,Charlie,Aah! Let me go!
1,5,Teacher,Charlie! {Charlie runs out of the room.}
1,5,SAM,"Oh really? Ah that's too bad Mr. Worthington. I would have paid a lot for that mirror. Okay, well maybe next time. All right, thanks. {SAM hangs up.}"
1,5,DEAN,So?
1,5,SAM,"So that was Mary's brother. The mirror was in the family for years, until he sold it one week ago to a store called Estate Antiques. A store in Toledo."
1,5,DEAN,"So wherever the mirror goes, that's where Mary goes?"
1,5,SAM,Her spirit's definitely tied up with it somehow.
1,5,DEAN,Isn't there an old superstition that says mirrors can capture spirits?
1,5,SAM,"Yeah there is. Yeah, when someone would die in a house people would cover up the mirrors so the ghost wouldn't get trapped."
1,5,DEAN,"So Mary dies in front of a mirror, and it draws in her spirit."
1,5,SAM,Yeah but how could she move through like a hundred different mirrors?
1,5,DEAN,"I don't know, but if the mirror is the source, I say we find it and smash it."
1,5,SAM,"Yeah, I don't know, maybe. {SAM's cell phone rings.} Hello. {The look of concern comes across his face again} Charlie?"
1,5,SAM,"{Sits next to Charlie} Hey, hey it's ok. Hey, you can open up your eyes Charlie. It's okay, all right?"
1,5,SAM,"Now listen. You're gonna stay right here on this bed, and you're not gonna look at glass, or anything else that has a reflection, okay? And as long as you do that, she cannot get you."
1,5,Charlie,"But I can't keep that up forever. I'm gonna die, aren't I?"
1,5,SAM,No. No. Not anytime soon.
1,5,DEAN,{Sits on the bed too} All right Charlie. We need to know what happened.
1,5,Charlie,We were in the bathroom. DONNA said it.
1,5,DEAN,"That's not what we're talking about. Something happened, didn't it? In your life...a secret...where someone got hurt. Can you tell us about it?"
1,5,Charlie,"I had this boyfriend. I loved him. But he kind of scared me too, you know? And one night, at his house, we got in this fight. Then I broke up with him, and he got upset, and he said he needed me and he loved me, and he said ""Charlie, if you walk out that door right now, I'm gonna kill myself."" And you know what I said? I said ""Go ahead."" And I left. How could I say that? How could I leave him like that? I just...I didn't believe him, you know? I should have. {She puts her face back on her knees and starts crying again.}"
1,5,DEAN,"You know her boyfriend killing himself, that's not really Charlie's fault."
1,5,SAM,"You know as well as I do spirits don't exactly see shades of gray, DEAN. Charlie had a secret, someone died, that's good enough for Mary."
1,5,DEAN,I guess.
1,5,SAM,"You know, I've been thinking. It might not be enough to just smash that mirror."
1,5,DEAN,"Why, what do you mean?"
1,5,SAM,"Well Mary's hard to pin down, right? I mean she moves around from mirror to mirror so who's to say that she's not just gonna keep hiding in them forever? So maybe we should try to pin her down, you know, summon her to her mirror and then smash it."
1,5,DEAN,Well how do you know that's going to work?
1,5,SAM,"I don't, not for sure."
1,5,DEAN,Well who's gonna summon her?
1,5,SAM,I will. She'll come after me.
1,5,DEAN,"You know what, that's it. {He pulls the car over.} This is about Jessica, isn't it? You think that's your dirty little secret that you killed her somehow? SAM, this has got to stop, man. I mean, the nightmares and calling her name out in the middle of the night—it's gonna kill you. Now listen to me—It wasn't your fault. If you wanna blame something, then blame the thing that killed her. Or hell, why don't you take a swing at me? I mean I'm the one that dragged you away from her in the first place."
1,5,SAM,I don't blame you.
1,5,DEAN,"Well you shouldn't blame yourself, because there's nothing you could've done."
1,5,SAM,I could've warned her.
1,5,DEAN,"About what? You didn't know what was gonna happen! And besides, all of this isn't a secret, I mean I know all about it. It's not gonna work with Mary anyway."
1,5,SAM,No you don't.
1,5,DEAN,I don't what?
1,5,SAM,You don't know all about it. I haven't told you everything.
1,5,DEAN,What are you talking about?
1,5,SAM,"Well it wouldn't really be a secret if I told you, would it?"
1,5,DEAN,"{looks surprised} No. I don't like it. It's not gonna happen, forget it."
1,5,SAM,DEAN that girl back there is going to die unless we do something about it. And you know what? Who knows how many more people are gonna die after that? Now we're doing this. You've got to let me do this.
1,5,DEAN,Well...that's just great. {He pulls out the picture of Mary's dead body to look at the mirror.} All right let's start looking.
1,5,DEAN,Maybe they've already sold it.
1,5,SAM,I don't think so.
1,5,DEAN,That's it. {sighs} You sure about this? {SAM hands DEAN the flashlight.}
1,5,SAM,{sighs} Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. {he looks at DEAN who gives him an unsure look back. SAM picks up the crowbar} Bloody Mary.
1,5,DEAN,"I'll go check that out. Stay here, be careful. {SAM readies the crowbar again} Smash anything that moves. {DEAN crawls away towards the front door. He sees a headlight.} Crap. {He puts the crowbar down and begins to walk to the door.}"
1,5,Police,Hold it.
1,5,DEAN,"Whoa guys, false alarm, I tripped the system."
1,5,Police,Who are you?
1,5,DEAN,I'm the boss's kid.
1,5,Police,You're Mister Yamashiro's kid?
1,5,SAM,Come on. Come into this one.
1,5,Reflection,It's your fault. You killed her. You killed Jessica.
1,5,DEAN,"Like I said, I was adopted."
1,5,Police,Yeah.
1,5,DEAN,"{Is being covered back and front by the two cops.} You know, I just—I really don't have time for this right now. {He punches one cop, backhands the other, then punches the cop in front of him again. They are now on the ground."
1,5,Reflection,"You never told her the truth—who you really were. {SAM is now falling towards the ground.} But it's more than that, isn't it? Those nightmares you've been having of Jessica dying, screaming, burning—You had them for days before she died. Didn't you!?! You were so desperate to ignore them, to believe they were just dreams. How could you ignore them like that? How could you leave her alone to die!?! You dreamt it would happen!!!"
1,5,DEAN,"{bends down to the floor to SAM} SAM, SAMmy!"
1,5,SAM,It's SAM.
1,5,DEAN,"[in reference to the blood that had come out of his eyes] God, are you okay?"
1,5,SAM,"Uh, yeah."
1,5,DEAN,"Come on, come on. {He pulls SAM up. He puts SAM's arm over his neck, and they begin to walk out, until Mary (again, much like SAMara coming out of the TV in The Ring) comes out of the frame of the mirror. They turn around to see her crawling over the broken glass. May walks towards them and they both fall to the ground. They both start bleeding from the face, but DEAN reaches up and pulls over a mirror so that Mary is forced to see her own reflection.}"
1,5,Reflection,You killed them! All those people! You killed them!
1,5,DEAN,Hey SAM?
1,5,SAM,Yeah?
1,5,DEAN,This has got to be like...what? 600 years of bad luck?
1,5,Charlie,So this is really over?
1,5,DEAN,"{nods} Yeah, it's over."
1,5,Charlie,"Thank you. {DEAN reaches back to shake her hand, and she gets out of the car.}"
1,5,SAM,"Charlie? {Charlie turns around} Your boyfriend's death...you really should try to forgive yourself. No matter what you did, you probably couldn't have stopped it. Sometimes bad things just happen."
1,5,DEAN,{Gently hits SAM} That's good advice. {They drive off} Hey SAM?
1,5,SAM,Yeah?
1,5,DEAN,"Now that this is all over, I want you to tell me what that secret is."
1,5,SAM,"Look...you're my brother and I'd die for you, but there are some things I need to keep to myself. {SAM looks out the window and sees Jessica in a white dress on the street corner standing next to a light pole, as they turn the corner she disappears behind the pole, and we don't see her again.}"
1,6,POLICE OFFICER,It’s ok. It’s ok. (The girl points to the room across the hall.)
1,6,GIRL,"In there! In there! (The S.W.A.T team moves to the other room. The man is there, trying to open a pair of doors leading to a balcony.)"
1,6,POLICE OFFICER,Freeze! Don’t move! Drop the knife. Keep your hands where I can see ‘em. Drop it! Hold it right there! Do it! (The man turns around. It is DEAN. The screen goes black.)
1,6,(FADE IN,Gas Station. One Week Earlier. SAM and DEAN pull into the station.)
1,6,DEAN,"Alright, I figure we’d hit Tucumcari by lunch, then head south, hit Bisbee by midnight. (SAM does not respond.) Sam wears women’s underwear."
1,6,SAM,"I’ve been listenin’, I’m just busy. (He is checking e-mails on his PalmPilot.)"
1,6,DEAN,Busy doin’ what?
1,6,SAM,Reading e-mails. (DEAN gets out of the car and starts to fill the tank with gas.)
1,6,DEAN,E-mails from who?
1,6,SAM,From my friends at Stanford.
1,6,DEAN,You’re kidding. You still keep in touch with your college buddies?
1,6,SAM,Why not?
1,6,DEAN,"Well, what exactly do you tell ‘em? You know, about where you’ve been, what you’ve been doin’?"
1,6,SAM,I tell ‘em I’m on a road trip with my big brother. I tell ‘em I needed some time off after Jess.
1,6,DEAN,"Oh, so you lie to ‘em."
1,6,SAM,No. I just don’t tell ‘em….everything.
1,6,DEAN,"Yeah, that’s called lying. I mean, hey, man, I get it, tellin’ the truth is far worse."
1,6,SAM,"So, what am I supposed to do, just cut everybody out of my life? (DEAN shrugs.) You’re serious?"
1,6,DEAN,"Look, it sucks, but in a job like this, you can’t get close to people, period."
1,6,SAM,"You’re kind of anti-social, you know that?"
1,6,DEAN,"Yeah, whatever. (SAM continues to read his e-mails.)"
1,6,SAM,God….
1,6,DEAN,What?
1,6,SAM,"In this e-mail from this girl, Rebecca Warren, one of those friends of mine."
1,6,DEAN,Is she hot? (SAM ignores him.)
1,6,SAM,"I went to school with her, and her brother, Zack. She says Zack’s been charged with murder. He’s been arrested for killing his girlfriend. Rebecca says he didn’t do it, but it sounds like the cops have a pretty good case."
1,6,DEAN,"Dude, what kind of people are you hangin’ out with?"
1,6,SAM,"No, man, I know Zack. He’s no killer."
1,6,DEAN,"Well, maybe you know Zack as well as he knows you."
1,6,SAM,They’re in St. Louis. We’re goin’. (DEAN chuckles.)
1,6,DEAN,"Look, sorry ‘bout your buddy, okay? But this does not sound like our kind of problem."
1,6,SAM,It is our problem. They’re my friends.
1,6,DEAN,"St. Louis is four hundred miles behind us, Sam. (They exchange a look. A minute later, they pull out of the gas station and start driving.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,EXT. – REBECCA’s house. She opens the door and sees SAM and DEAN.)
1,6,REBECCA,"(happily) Oh my God, Sam!"
1,6,SAM,"Well, if it isn’t little Becky."
1,6,REBECCA,You know what you can do with that little Becky crap. (She smiles and they hug.)
1,6,SAM,I got your e-mail.
1,6,REBECCA,I didn’t think that you would come here. (DEAN steps forward and extends his hand.)
1,6,DEAN,Dean. Older brother. (She shakes his hand.)
1,6,REBECCA,Hi.
1,6,DEAN,Hi.
1,6,SAM,We’re here to help. Whatever we can do.
1,6,REBECCA,"Come in. (They walk inside the house, and DEAN shuts the door.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,INT. – House.)
1,6,DEAN,Nice place.
1,6,REBECCA,It’s my parents’. I was just crashing here for the long weekend when everything happened. I decided to take the semester off. I’m gonna stay until Zack’s free.
1,6,SAM,Where are your folks?
1,6,REBECCA,"They live in Paris for half the year, so they’re on their way home now for the trial. (They enter the kitchen.) Do you guys want a beer or something?"
1,6,DEAN,(smiling) Hey—
1,6,SAM,"No, thanks. So, tell us what happened."
1,6,SAM,"You know, maybe we could see the crime scene. Zack’s house."
1,6,DEAN,We could.
1,6,REBECCA,"Why? I mean, what could you do?"
1,6,SAM,"Well, me, not much. But Dean’s a cop. (DEAN laughs.)"
1,6,DEAN,"Detective, actually."
1,6,REBECCA,Really? (DEAN nods.) Where?
1,6,DEAN,"Bisbee, Arizona. But I’m off-duty now."
1,6,REBECCA,"You guys, it’s so nice to offer, but I just—I don’t know."
1,6,SAM,"Bec, look, I know Zack didn’t do this. Now, we have to find a way to prove that he’s innocent."
1,6,REBECCA,"Okay. I’m gonna go get the keys. (She walks away, down the hall.)"
1,6,DEAN,"Oh, yeah, man, you’re a real straight shooter with your friends."
1,6,SAM,"Look, Zack and Becky need our help."
1,6,DEAN,I just don’t think this is our kind of problem.
1,6,SAM,"Two places at once? We’ve looked into less. (DEAN says nothing, defeated.)"
1,6,(FADE TO,"EXT. – ZACK’s house. DEAN, SAM, and REBECCA park the car and get out.)"
1,6,REBECCA,(to DEAN) You’re sure this is okay?
1,6,DEAN,Yeah. I am an officer of the law. (They walk to the house.)
1,6,(CUT TO,INT. – ZACK’s house. SAM and DEAN enter and look around. The furniture and walls of the house are smeared with blood. REBECCA stays on the porch steps.)
1,6,SAM,"Bec, you wanna wait outside?"
1,6,REBECCA,No. I wanna help. (She ducks under the police tape and enters the house.)
1,6,SAM,Tell us what else the police said.
1,6,REBECCA,"(tearfully) Well, there’s no sign of a break-in. They say that Emily let her attacker in. The lawyers—they’re already talking about plea bargain. (She looks around the room, crying.) Oh, God…."
1,6,SAM,"Look, Bec, if Zack didn’t do this, it means someone else did. Any idea who? (REBECCA shakes her head, then begins to remember something.)"
1,6,REBECCA,"Um, there was something, about a week before. Somebody broke in here and stole some clothes—Zack’s clothes. The police—they don’t think it’s anything. I mean, we’re not that far from downtown. Sometimes people get robbed. (SAM walks away. DEAN moves to the open front door and sees the neighbor’s dog, barking loudly. REBECCA comes up behind him.) You know, that used to be the sweetest dog."
1,6,DEAN,What happened?
1,6,REBECCA,He just changed.
1,6,DEAN,Do you remember when he changed?
1,6,REBECCA,"I guess around the time of the murder. (DEAN looks at her, then walks away.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,"INT. – House. SAM is in the hallway, looking at a framed picture of himself, ZACK, and REBECCA. DEAN walks over to him.)"
1,6,DEAN,"So, the neighbor’s dog went psycho right around the time Zack’s girlfriend was killed."
1,6,SAM,Animals can have a sharp sense of the paranormal.
1,6,DEAN,"Yeah, maybe Fido saw somethin’."
1,6,SAM,"So, you think maybe this is our kind of problem?"
1,6,DEAN,"No. Probably not. But we should look at the security tape, you know, just to make sure."
1,6,SAM,Yeah.
1,6,DEAN,"Yeah. (REBECCA walks over to them.) So, the tape. The security footage—you think maybe your lawyers could get their hands on it, ‘cause I just don’t have that kind of jurisdiction."
1,6,REBECCA,I’ve already got it. I didn’t wanna say something in front of the cop. (DEAN laughs.) I stole it off the lawyer’s desk. I just had to see it for myself.
1,6,DEAN,All right. (All three of them leave.)
1,6,(FADE TO,"Street. ZACK is sitting on a bench across the street from a house. He watches an Asian man come out of the house with his wife, LINDSAY.)"
1,6,LINDSAY,Why do they always have to send you?
1,6,ALEX,Because I'm the best.
1,6,LINDSAY,I know. That's why i want you to stay home.
1,6,ALEX,It's just Kansas City. I’ll be home tomorrow night and make it up to you.
1,6,(FADE TO,"INT. – REBECCA’s house. Living room. DEAN, SAM, and REBECCA are watching the security footage.)"
1,6,REBECCA,Here he comes. (The tape shows ZACK entering his house.)
1,6,REBECCA,Our lawyers hired some kind of video expert. He says the tape’s authentic. It wasn’t tampered with. (SAM seems to notice something on the tape.)
1,6,SAM,"Hey, Bec, can we take those beers now?"
1,6,REBECCA,"Oh, sure. (She gets up to go to the kitchen.)"
1,6,SAM,"Hey. (She turns around.) Maybe some sandwiches, too?"
1,6,REBECCA,"What do you think this is, Hooters? (She leaves the room.)"
1,6,DEAN,I wish. (He walks over to SAM.) What is it?
1,6,SAM,"Check this out. (He rewinds the tape, then replays it. One of the frames shows ZACK looking directly at the camera. His eyes are silver. SAM pauses the tape.)"
1,6,DEAN,"Well, maybe it’s just a camera flare."
1,6,SAM,"That’s not like any camera flare I’ve ever seen. You know, a lot of cultures believe that a photograph can catch a glimpse of the soul."
1,6,DEAN,Right.
1,6,SAM,"Remember that dog that was freakin’ out? Maybe he saw this thing. Maybe this is some kind of dark double of Zack’s, something that looks like him but isn’t him."
1,6,DEAN,Like a Doppelganger.
1,6,SAM,Yeah. It’d sure explain how he was two places at once.
1,6,(CUT TO,INT. – House. The Asian man enters.)
1,6,MAN,"Honey, it’s me. Flight cancelled at the last minute. (He sets down his briefcase and keys and looks around.) I called. Why didn’t you answer? (LINDSAY doesn’t respond.) Lindsay? (He looks around.) Lindsay? (He turns around and sees blood spattered on the wall.) Lindsay?! (He opens the door to a nearby room and finds LINDSAY. She is tied in a chair, beaten and bloody. The man rushes over to her and takes the gag out of her mouth.) It’s ok, Lindsay, it’s me."
1,6,LINDSAY,"Please, don’t hurt me anymore! Leave me alone! (The man looks at her, confused. He hears a noise in the other room and leaves. In the living room, the man looks around. Suddenly, he turns and sees himself, standing there with a baseball bat. The man is puzzled. The double’s eyes glint silver, and he hits the man over the head with the bat. The screen goes black.)"
1,6,(FADE IN,EXT. – ZACK’s house. DEAN and SAM park their car behind the house and get out.)
1,6,SAM,"I realized something. The videotape shows the killer goin’ in, but not comin’ out."
1,6,DEAN,"So, he came out the back door? (He leans against the hood of his car.)"
1,6,SAM,"Right. So, there should be a trail to follow. A trail the police would never pursue."
1,6,SAM,Blood. Somebody came this way.
1,6,DEAN,"Yeah, but the trail ends. I don’t see anything over here. (An ambulance drives past them, and they exchange a look.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,EXT. – House. DEAN and SAM observe the scene. The Asian man is handcuffed and is stepping into a police car.)
1,6,DEAN,(to nearby woman) What happened?
1,6,WOMAN,He tried to kill his wife. Tied her up and beat her.
1,6,SAM,Really?
1,6,WOMAN,"I used to see him going to work in the morning. He’d wave, say hello. He seemed like such a nice guy. (They watch the man get taken away.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,"EXT. – House. Later. SAM is on the side of the house, looking around. He looks inside two garbage cans but finds nothing. He moves to the front of the house, where DEAN comes behind him.)"
1,6,DEAN,Hey. (SAM turns around.) Remember when I said this wasn’t our kind of problem?
1,6,SAM,Yeah.
1,6,DEAN,Definitely our kind of problem.
1,6,SAM,What’d you find out?
1,6,DEAN,"Well, I just talked to the patrolman who was first on the scene, heard this guy, Alex’s story. Apparently the dude was driving home from a business trip when his wife was attacked."
1,6,SAM,"So, he was two places at once."
1,6,DEAN,"Exactly. Then he sees himself in the house, police think he’s a nutjob."
1,6,SAM,Two dark doubles attacking loved ones in exactly the same way.
1,6,DEAN,"Could be the same thing doin’ it, too. (SAM thinks for a second.)"
1,6,SAM,Shapeshifter? (DEAN shrugs.) Something that can make itself look like anyone?
1,6,DEAN,"Every culture in the world has a shapeshifter lore. You know, legends of creatures who can transform themselves into animals or other men."
1,6,SAM,"Right, skinwalkers, werewolves."
1,6,DEAN,We’ve got two attacks within blocks of each other. I’m guessin’ we’ve got a shapeshifter prowlin’ the neighborhood.
1,6,SAM,"Let me ask you this—in all this shapeshifter lore, can any of them fly?"
1,6,DEAN,Not that I know of.
1,6,SAM,I picked up a trail here. Someone ran out the back of this building and headed off this way.
1,6,DEAN,Just like your friend’s house.
1,6,SAM,"Yeah. And, just like at Zack’s house, the trail suddenly ends. I mean, whatever it is just disappeared."
1,6,DEAN,"Well, there’s another way to go—down. (They look down and notice a manhole.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,Sewer. DEAN and SAM climb down the manhole and look around.)
1,6,SAM,"I bet this runs right by Zack’s house, too. The shapeshifter could be using the sewer system to get around."
1,6,DEAN,I think you’re right. Look at this. (They bend down and examine a pile of blood and skin on the ground. They are both disgusted.)
1,6,SAM,Is this from his victims? (DEAN takes out a pocketknife and holds up some of the skin.)
1,6,DEAN,"You know, I just had a sick thought. When the shapeshifter changes shape—maybe it sheds."
1,6,SAM,That is sick. (DEAN puts the bloody pile back on the ground.)
1,6,(CUT TO,Car. DEAN opens the trunk and takes out some weapons.)
1,6,DEAN,"Well, one thing I learned from Dad, is that no matter what kind of shapeshifter it is, there’s one sure way to kill it."
1,6,SAM,Silver bullet to the heart.
1,6,DEAN,That’s right. (SAM’s cell phone rings. He answers it.)
1,6,SAM,This is Sam. (The scene alternates between the car and REBECCA’s kitchen.)
1,6,REBECCA,Where are you?
1,6,SAM,"We’re near Zack’s, we’re just checkin’ some things out."
1,6,REBECCA,"Well, look, Sam, just stop, ‘cause I really don’t need your help anymore."
1,6,SAM,What are you talkin’ about?
1,6,REBECCA,I told the lawyers that we went to the crime scene. (SAM scoffs.)
1,6,SAM,Why would you do that?
1,6,REBECCA,"Well, I told them that we were with a police officer. And they checked it out, and they told me that there is no Detective Dean Winchester."
1,6,SAM,Bec—
1,6,REBECCA,"No, I don’t understand why you would lie to me about something like that."
1,6,SAM,We’re tryin’ to help.
1,6,REBECCA,"Oh, trying to help? Do you realize that that was a sealed crime scene? This could have just ruined Zack’s case."
1,6,SAM,"Bec, I’m sorry, but—"
1,6,REBECCA,"No, goodbye, Sam. (She hangs up. DEAN walks over to SAM, who looks disappointed.)"
1,6,DEAN,"I hate to say it, but that’s exactly what I’m talkin’ about. You lie to your friends because if they knew the real you, they’d be freaked. It’s just—it’d be easier if—"
1,6,SAM,If I was like you.
1,6,DEAN,"Hey, man, like it or not, we are not like other people. But I’ll tell you one thing. This whole gig—it ain’t without perks. (He holds up a gun. SAM takes it and puts it in the back of his jeans. They walk away.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,Sewer. DEAN and SAM are looking around with their flashlights and guns.)
1,6,DEAN,I think we’re close to its lair.
1,6,SAM,Why do you say that?
1,6,DEAN,Because there’s another puke-inducing pile next to your face. (SAM turns and sees another pile of blood and skin on a nearby pipe.)
1,6,SAM,"(disgusted) Oh, God! (They look around the area and see a pile of clothes in a corner.)"
1,6,DEAN,Looks like it’s lived here for a while.
1,6,SAM,"Who knows how many murders he’s gotten away with? (SAM turns and sees the shapeshifter, still in the form of the Asian man, standing behind DEAN.) Dean! (DEAN turns and gets punched by the shapeshifter. He falls to the ground, and the shapeshifter runs away. SAM shoots after it a few times but misses. He moves over to DEAN.)"
1,6,DEAN,"Get the son of a bitch! (SAM and DEAN run away, following the shapeshifter.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,"Street. The shapeshifter comes out of the manhole and runs away. Seconds later, SAM and DEAN come out and look around.)"
1,6,SAM,"All right, let’s split up."
1,6,DEAN,"All right, I’ll meet you around the other side."
1,6,SAM,All right. (They walk away in separate directions.)
1,6,(CUT TO,"Alley. DEAN is looking around, with his gun drawn. Passersby turn away, frightened.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,"Street. SAM is also searching, while keeping his gun inside his jacket.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,Alley. DEAN is still looking frantically.)
1,6,(FADE TO,Street corner. SAM is waiting. DEAN comes up behind him.)
1,6,DEAN,Hey. (SAM turns around.) Anything?
1,6,SAM,No. He’s gone.
1,6,DEAN,"All right, let’s get back to the car. (SAM crosses the street. DEAN stops, waiting for a passing car to drive by. As the car passes, DEAN’s eyes momentarily glow silver. The screen goes black.)"
1,6,(FADE IN,Street. DEAN and SAM stop at the car.)
1,6,SAM,You think he found another way underground?
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"Yeah, probably. You got the keys? (SAM stops and thinks before turning around.)"
1,6,SAM,"Hey, didn’t Dad once face a shapeshifter in San Antonio?"
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"Oh, that was Austin. It turned out not to be a shapeshifter, it was a thought form. A psychic projection, remember?"
1,6,SAM,"Oh, right. Here ya go. (He throws the shapeshifter the keys and walks away. The shapeshifter opens the trunk and observes all the weapons. He laughs.) Don’t move! (The shapeshifter turns and sees SAM pointing the gun at him.) What have you done with him?"
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"Dude, chill. It’s me, all right?"
1,6,SAM,"No, I don’t think so. Where’s my brother?"
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"You’re about to shoot him. Sam, calm down."
1,6,SAM,You caught those keys with your left. Your shoulder was hurt.
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"Yeah, it’s better. What do you want me to do, cry?"
1,6,SAM,You’re not my brother.
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"Why don’t you pull the trigger, then? Hm? ‘Cause you’re not sure. Dude, you know me."
1,6,SAM,Don’t. (The shapeshifter pauses before hitting SAM twice with a crowbar. SAM falls to the ground.)
1,6,(CUT TO,"Unknown location. SAM wakes up in a dingy, dusty room. His neck and hands are bound to a wooden post. The shapeshifter walks over to him and backhands him. SAM groans.)"
1,6,SAM,Where is he? Where’s Dean?
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,I wouldn’t worry about him. I’d worry about you.
1,6,SAM,Where is he?
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"You don’t really wanna know. (He chuckles.) I swear, the more I learn about you and your family—I thought I came from a bad background."
1,6,SAM,"What do you mean, learn? (The shapeshifter stops. He grabs his head in pain and grimaces. A quick succession of audio clips from past episodes can be heard. SAM looks at the shapeshifter, confused. The shapeshifter relaxes and looks at SAM.)"
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"He’s sure got issues with you. You got to go to college. He had to stay home. I mean, I had to stay home. With Dad. You don’t think I had dreams of my own? But Dad needed me. Where the hell were you?"
1,6,SAM,Where is my brother? (The shapeshifter leans in close to SAM.)
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"I am your brother. See, deep down, I’m just jealous. You got friends. You could have a life. Me? I know I’m a freak. And sooner or later, everybody’s gonna leave me. (He backs away.)"
1,6,SAM,What are you talkin’ about?
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"You left. Hell, I did everything Dad asked me to, and he ditched me, too. No explanation, nothin’, just poof. Left me with your sorry ass. But, still, this life? It’s not without its perks. (He laughs.) I meet the nicest people. Like little Becky. You know, Dean would bang her if he had the chance. Let’s see what happens. (He smiles and covers SAM with a sheet.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,"INT. – REBECCA’s house. There is a knock at the door, and REBECCA comes downstairs to open it. It is the shapeshifter, still in the form of DEAN.)"
1,6,REBECCA,Oh. Hi.
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,I know what you’re gonna say.
1,6,REBECCA,"Oh, you do?"
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"Well, no, not exactly. But I can take a guess. Get off my porch? (She laughs.)"
1,6,REBECCA,That’s about right.
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"I admit it, we lied. Thought I’d try to explain myself. Sam told me not to come, but, you know, I thought, what the hell, I have to try. (He smiles.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,Unknown location. SAM is trying to get out of his ropes but fails.)
1,6,SAM,"Damn it. (He hears movement in another area of the room, and he hears someone coughing.)"
1,6,DEAN,"(OS) That better be you, Sam, and not that freak of nature. (SAM laughs.)"
1,6,SAM,"Yeah, it’s me. (DEAN manages to uncover himself from the sheet and starts to undo his ropes.) He went to Rebecca’s, lookin’ like you."
1,6,DEAN,"Well, he’s not stupid. He picked the handsome one. (SAM gives him a confused look, then continues to work through his ropes.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,REBECCA’s house. Living room. REBECCA and the shapeshifter are sitting in front of the fireplace.)
1,6,REBECCA,"So, you’re saying that there’s something out there that made itself look like my brother."
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,Mmhmm.
1,6,REBECCA,What’d you call it?
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"A shapeshifter. (REBECCA laughs and rolls her eyes.) Yeah, maybe we’re crazy. But what if we’re not? I mean, look, you said it yourself that Zack was in two places at once. Now, tell me how that can happen."
1,6,REBECCA,"Okay, so, this thing—it can make itself look like anybody?"
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,That’s right. (She chuckles.)
1,6,REBECCA,"Well, what is it, like a genetic freak? (The shapeshifter laughs.)"
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"Maybe. Evolution is about mutation, right? So, maybe this thing was born human but was different. Hideous and hated. Until he learned to become someone else. (REBECCA looks around, uncomfortable. The shapeshifter’s eyes glint silver, and he smiles.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,Unknown location. DEAN and SAM are still working their way out of their ropes.)
1,6,SAM,"Yeah, that’s the thing. He didn’t just look like you, he was you. Or he was becoming you. (DEAN finally works his way out of the ropes.)"
1,6,DEAN,What do you mean?
1,6,SAM,"I don’t know, it was like he was downloading your thoughts and memories."
1,6,DEAN,"You mean, like the Vulcan mind meld?"
1,6,SAM,"Yeah, somethin’ like that. I mean, maybe that’s why he doesn’t just kill us. (DEAN gets up and walks over to SAM.)"
1,6,DEAN,Maybe he needs to keep us alive. Psychic connection. (He starts untying SAM’s ropes.)
1,6,SAM,"Hands. Yeah. Come on, we gotta go. He’s probably at Rebecca’s already."
1,6,(CUT TO,Alley. DEAN and SAM climb out a window and onto the street.)
1,6,SAM,"Come on. We gotta find a phone, call the police."
1,6,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You’re gonna put an APB out on me. (SAM shrugs.)"
1,6,SAM,Sorry.
1,6,DEAN,This way. (They start running down the street.)
1,6,(CUT TO,REBECCA’s house. Living room.)
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"It’s funny. I kind of understand him. He’s all alone—close to no one. All he wants is for someone to love him. He’s like me. (REBECCA looks very uncomfortable.) You know, everybody needs a little human touch now and then. It’s so hard to be different. (He tucks REBECCA’s hair behind her ear. She shrugs away.)"
1,6,REBECCA,"You should go. (The shapeshifter leans in and whispers something in her ear. She looks horrified and stands up.) You are disgusting, just get the hell out of here!"
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"Rebecca, just calm down. (He stands up.)"
1,6,REBECCA,Calm down? What is wrong with you?
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,What’s wrong with me? What’s wrong with you? (She walks to the phone.)
1,6,REBECCA,"I’m calling the police. (The shapeshifter walks over to her and throws the phone to the floor. She screams and tries to run away, but he trips her and she falls to the ground. He straddles her legs and begins tying her hands with the telephone cord.)"
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,Give me your hands! (She continues to scream.) Shut up!
1,6,(CUT TO,"Bedroom. REBECCA is tied in a chair, beaten and bloody.)"
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"You’re a nice girl, Rebecca. I mean, I liked you. Believe me, that makes this harder. (He holds up a knife and examines it.) But I gotta do what I gotta do. (He moves towards her. Suddenly, they hear a crash come from another room of the house. REBECCA screams but the shapeshifter covers her mouth and holds the knife to her throat.) Shh."
1,6,(CUT TO,"Hallway. The S.W.A.T. team is searching the house. While their backs are turned, the shapeshifter crosses the hall and goes into another room.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,"Second bedroom. The shapeshifter enters and closes the door, looking around frantically. He moves to a set of doors leading out to a balcony. Just as he opens the doors, the S.W.A.T team enters.)"
1,6,POLICE OFFICER,"Freeze! Drop the knife! Drop the knife! Drop the knife! (The shapeshifter throws the knife at the police officer, and the rest of the team begins shooting. The shapeshifter kicks one of the men, then goes outside and jumps off the balcony, onto the grass below.) Come on! Come on! Go! Go! (The shapeshifter runs away, while the team continues to shoot and miss him several times.)"
1,6,(FADE TO,"Sewer. The shapeshifter stops walking, looking weak. He takes off his jacket and shirt, then falls to his knees. He groans and screams in pain as he continues to shed his skin. The screen goes black.)"
1,6,(FADE IN,"Street. DEAN and SAM are standing in front of a store window, watching a news report that is being shown on a display of televisions.)"
1,6,REPORTER,"An anonymous tip led police to a home in the Central West End, where a S.W.A.T team discovered a local woman bound and gagged. Her attacker, a white male, approximately twenty-four to thirty years of age, was discovered hiding in her home. (A sketch of DEAN appears on the screen.)"
1,6,DEAN,Man! That’s not even a good picture. (SAM looks around cautiously.)
1,6,SAM,It’s good enough. (He walks away.)
1,6,DEAN,Man! (He follows SAM.)
1,6,(CUT TO,Alley. DEAN and SAM are walking. DEAN steps into a puddle.)
1,6,SAM,Come on. (He pauses.) They said attempted murder. At least we know—
1,6,DEAN,I didn’t kill her.
1,6,SAM,"We’ll check with Rebecca in the morning, see if she’s all right."
1,6,DEAN,"All right, but first I wanna find that handsome devil and kick the holy crap out of him. (They stop walking.)"
1,6,SAM,We have no weapons. No silver bullets.
1,6,DEAN,"Sam, the guy’s walkin’ around with my face, okay, it’s a little personal, I wanna find him."
1,6,SAM,Okay. Where do we look?
1,6,DEAN,"Well, we could start with the sewers."
1,6,SAM,"We have no weapons. He stole our guns, we need more. (They pause to think.) The car?"
1,6,DEAN,I’m bettin’ he drove over to Rebecca’s.
1,6,SAM,The news said he fled on foot. I bet it’s still parked there.
1,6,DEAN,(upset) The thought of him drivin’ my car.
1,6,SAM,"All right, come on. (They start walking.)"
1,6,DEAN,It’s killin’ me.
1,6,SAM,Let it go.
1,6,(CUT TO,EXT. – REBECCA’s house. DEAN and SAM walk around the side of the house and see DEAN’s car parked.)
1,6,DEAN,"(relieved) Oh, there she is! Finally, something went right tonight. (A police car appears and parks next to DEAN’s car.) Oh, crap. (They turn around, but another police car is parked a few yards away.) This way, this way. (He moves towards a fence.)"
1,6,SAM,You go. I’ll hold ‘em off.
1,6,DEAN,What are you talking about? They’ll catch you.
1,6,SAM,"Look, they can’t hold me. Just go, keep out of sight. Meet me at Rebecca’s. (DEAN starts to climb over the fence.) Dean. (DEAN stops and turns around.) Stay out of the sewers alone. (DEAN says nothing and hops over the fence.) I mean it!"
1,6,DEAN,"(OS) Yeah, yeah!"
1,6,POLICE OFFICER,Don’t move! Keep your hands where I can see ‘em. (SAM raises his hands in the air.)
1,6,(FADE TO,Car. DEAN is getting weapons from the trunk.)
1,6,DEAN,"I’m sorry, Sam. But you know me—I just can’t wait. (He closes the trunk and walks away.)"
1,6,(FADE TO,Sewer. DEAN is looking around. He comes across a chamber filled with candles and chains. Revolting piles of skin and blood are on the floor. DEAN hears a noise and moves to another area of the sewer. He sees a large figure covered with a sheet. He removes it and sees REBECCA. Her hands and feet are bound together with rope.)
1,6,DEAN,Rebecca?
1,6,(CUT TO,"INT. – REBECCA’s house. SAM is sitting, having a beer. He is talking with the shapeshifter, who is in the form of REBECCA."
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"So, say this shapeshifter is real. By the way, you know you’re crazy? But, um, say it is real. How do you stop it? (She replaces SAM’s empty beer bottle with a new one.)"
1,6,SAM,Thanks. (He sighs.) Silver bullet to the heart. (She chuckles.)
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"You are crazy. (She hits him over the head with the empty bottle. He falls over, unconscious. The shapeshifter’s eyes momentarily glow silver.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,Sewer. DEAN is untying REBECCA’s ropes.)
1,6,DEAN,What happened?
1,6,REBECCA,"(crying) I was walking home, and everything just went white. Someone hit me over the head, and I wound up here just in time to see that thing turn into me. I don’t know, how is that even possible?"
1,6,DEAN,"Okay, okay. It’s okay. (He finishes untying her.) Come on. Can you walk? (She nods.) Okay, we’ve gotta hurry. Sam went to see you."
1,6,(CUT TO,"INT. – REBECCA’s house. The shapeshifter has changed back into the form of DEAN. He finishes tying up SAM’s hands and feet, then starts walking around the kitchen.)"
1,6,SAM,What are you gonna do to me?
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"Oh, I’m not gonna do anything. Dean will, though."
1,6,SAM,They’ll never catch him.
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"Oh, doesn’t matter. Murder in the first of his own brother? He’ll be hunted the rest of his life. (He picks up a sharp knife and examines it.)"
1,6,(FADE TO,Living room. Later.)
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"I must say, I will be sorry to lose this skin. Your brother’s got a lot of good qualities. You should appreciate him more than you do. (He pours himself a drink.) Cheers. (He takes a drink, then picks up the knife from the kitchen and sticks it into the edge of the pool table. SAM lifts his legs and kicks the shapeshifter, who falls to the ground. SAM quickly sits up and moves his hands up and down on the blade of the knife. The ropes break apart. The shapeshifter gets up, and SAM takes the knife and swings at him. The shapeshifter grabs SAM’s arm in mid-swing and twists it. SAM falls to the ground.) Oh, you son of a bitch. (He and SAM start to fight. SAM tries to pin DEAN down.) Not bad, little brother."
1,6,SAM,"You’re not him. (They continue to fight. The shapeshifter finally throws SAM into a bookshelf. It falls apart, and books fall on top of SAM.)"
1,6,SHAPESHIFTER,"Even when we were kids, I always kicked your ass. (He grabs a pool cue and swings at SAM but misses and hits a light fixture. After fighting for several more minutes, they fall onto a coffee table. The shapeshifter pins SAM to the floor and starts to choke him.)"
1,6,DEAN,"(OS) Hey! (The shapeshifter sees DEAN and gets off of SAM. DEAN aims his gun at the shapeshifter and shoots him in the heart twice. The shapeshifter falls to the ground, dead. REBECCA enters and sees SAM on the floor.)"
1,6,REBECCA,Sam! (She rushes over to him. DEAN walks to the shapeshifter’s body and notices him wearing DEAN’s necklace. DEAN yanks it from around the shapeshifter’s neck and nods knowingly at SAM and REBECCA. The screen goes black.)
1,6,(FADE IN,"EXT. – REBECCA’s house. Day. DEAN is by the car, looking at a map. REBECCA and SAM come outside.)"
1,6,REBECCA,"So, this is what you do? You and your brother—you hunt down these kinds of things?"
1,6,SAM,"Yeah, pretty much."
1,6,REBECCA,"I can’t believe it. I mean, I saw it with my own eyes. And, I mean, does everybody at school—nobody knows that you do this?"
1,6,SAM,No.
1,6,REBECCA,Did Jessica know? (SAM looks thoughtful.)
1,6,SAM,"No, she didn’t."
1,6,REBECCA,Must be lonely.
1,6,SAM,"Oh, no. No, it’s not so bad. Anyway, what can I do? It’s my family. (She laughs.)"
1,6,REBECCA,"Well, you know, Zack and me, and everybody at school—we really miss you. (She hugs him.)"
1,6,SAM,"(sadly) Yeah, me too. (They pull away.)"
1,6,REBECCA,"Well, will you call sometime?"
1,6,SAM,"It might not be for a little while. (REBECCA nods and waves goodbye to DEAN. He waves back, and she goes back inside the house. SAM walks over to the car.)"
1,6,DEAN,"So, what about your friend, Zack?"
1,6,SAM,"Cops are blamin’ this Dean Winchester guy for Emily’s murder. They found the murder weapon in the guy’s lair, Zack’s clothes stained with her blood. Now they’re thinking maybe the surveillance tape was tampered with. Yeah, Becca says Zack will be released soon. (He smiles. DEAN rolls his eyes and gets in the car.)"
1,6,(CUT TO,INT. – Car. DEAN and SAM are driving.)
1,6,DEAN,"Sorry, man."
1,6,SAM,About what?
1,6,DEAN,"I really wish things could be different, you know? I wish you could just be….Joe College."
1,6,SAM,"No, that’s okay. You know, the truth is, even at Stanford, deep down, I never really fit in."
1,6,DEAN,"Well, that’s ‘cause you’re a freak."
1,6,SAM,"Yeah, thanks."
1,6,DEAN,"Well, I’m a freak, too. I’m right there with ya, all the way. (SAM laughs.)"
1,6,SAM,"Yeah, I know you are."
1,6,DEAN,"You know, I gotta say—I’m sorry I’m gonna miss it."
1,6,SAM,Miss what?
1,6,DEAN,How many chances am I gonna have to see my own funeral? (He and SAM smile at each other. They continue to drive as the screen fades to black.)
1,7,TAYLOR,Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.
1,7,LORI,There’s nothing you wouldn’t do. (She leaves)
1,7,TAYLOR,(smiling to herself) That’s true.
1,7,(CUT TO,"9 Mile Road. LORI’s boyfriend’s car pulls up. Standing behind the trees, there is a tall figure with a hook.)"
1,7,LORI,I thought we were going to the party.
1,7,RICH,"Well, we can’t arrive on time."
1,7,(CUT TO,INT. – RICH’s car)
1,7,LORI,"You know, if I didn’t know any better, I’d think you brought me here on purpose."
1,7,RICH,(feigning shock) What? I’m offended.
1,7,LORI,"(sarcastically) Yeah, I’m sure. (They smile and begin to kiss. LORI’s cell phone rings and they reluctantly break away. The caller ID says “Dad Calling”.)"
1,7,RICH,You wanna get that?
1,7,LORI,"Definitely not. (She shuts the ringer off. They resume kissing, and RICH put his hand under LORI’s halter strap. She pulls away and moves his hand.) No."
1,7,RICH,"It’s ok. (LORI looks uncomfortable. Outside, the figure with the hook is moving slowly out from the trees. Back inside the car, RICH begins kissing LORI’s neck and puts his hand back under her strap. She looks even more uncomfortable and pulls away.)"
1,7,LORI,"Hey, I mean it. (They hear a loud screeching noise. Outside, the man is dragging his hook along a Dead End sign.)"
1,7,LORI,(looking around) What was that?
1,7,RICH,I don’t know. (They hear the same sound. The man is shown dragging his hook along a sign that says 9 Mile Road.)
1,7,RICH,What is that? (He opens the car door.)
1,7,LORI,"No! Rich, no!"
1,7,RICH,"No, just wait here. (He gets out of the car and shuts the door. LORI looks terrified. Outside, RICH is looking around when he hears more screeching. He turns to see a long scratch being made on the side of his car, but the Hook Man is invisible.) What the hell?"
1,7,(CUT TO,An outdoor café. SAM is on a payphone.)
1,7,SAM,"Alright, thank you for your time. (He hangs up and walks back to the table. DEAN is working at the laptop.)"
1,7,DEAN,"Your, uh, half-caf, double vanilla latte is gettin’ cold over here, Francis."
1,7,SAM,Bite me. (He sits down.)
1,7,DEAN,"So, anything? (SAM shakes his head.)"
1,7,SAM,I had ‘em check the FBI’s Missing Persons Data Bank. No John Doe’s fitting Dad’s description. I even ran his plates for traffic violations.
1,7,DEAN,"Sam, I’m tellin’ ya, I don’t think Dad wants to be found. (SAM looks disappointed.) Check this out. (He shows SAM an article on the computer about RICH’s death.) It’s a news item out of Planes Courier. Ankeny, Iowa. It’s only about a hundred miles from here."
1,7,SAM,"(reading) “The mutilated body was found near the victim’s car, parked on 9 Mile Road.”"
1,7,DEAN,Keep reading.
1,7,SAM,"“Authorities are unable to provide a realistic description of the killer. The sole eyewitness, whose name has been withheld, is quoted as saying the attacker was invisible.”"
1,7,DEAN,Could be something interesting.
1,7,SAM,Or it could be nothing at all. One freaked out witness who didn’t see anything? Doesn’t mean it’s the Invisible Man.
1,7,DEAN,But what if it is? Dad would check it out.
1,7,(CUT TO,SAM and DEAN driving. They stop at the fraternity where RICH lived. The other frat brothers are confused. SAM and DEAN get out of the car.)
1,7,SAM,"One more time, why are we here?"
1,7,DEAN,Victim lived here. (They walk up to some guys fixing a car.) Nice wheels. (They look at him strangely.) We’re your fraternity brothers. From Ohio. We’re new in town. Transfers. Looking for a place to stay. (He grins.)
1,7,(CUT TO,INT.- Fraternity dorm room.)
1,7,FRAT BOY,Who are you?
1,7,DEAN,"(pointing to SAM) He’s the artist. Things he can do with a brush. (SAM, mortified, takes the brush and can. DEAN sits on a chair and picks up a magazine.) So (He looks at the name on the magazine) Murph. Is it true?"
1,7,MURPH,What?
1,7,DEAN,We heard one of the guys around here got killed last week.
1,7,MURPH,(sadly) Yeah.
1,7,SAM,What happened?
1,7,MURPH,They’re saying some psycho with a knife. Maybe a drifter passing through. Rich was a good guy.
1,7,SAM,Rich he was with somebody?
1,7,MURPH,Not just somebody. Lori Sorensen.
1,7,DEAN,Who’s Lori Sorensen? (to SAM) You missed a spot. Just down there >on the back. (SAM looks annoyed. DEAN grins.)
1,7,DEAN,"You wouldn’t happen to know which church, would ya?"
1,7,(CUT TO,EXT.- church. The Mass has ended.)
1,7,LORI,I can’t. It’s Sunday night.
1,7,TAYLOR,It’s just us girls. We’re gonna do tequila shots and watch Reality Bites.
1,7,LORI,My dad makes dinner every Sunday night.
1,7,TAYLOR,"Come on, Lori. I know this has been hard, but you are allowed to have fun."
1,7,LORI,I’ll try. (TAYLOR rolls her eyes.)
1,7,TAYLOR,Ok. (They hug and TAYLOR leaves. SAM and DEAN walk up to LORI.)
1,7,SAM,Are you Lori?
1,7,LORI,Yeah.
1,7,SAM,"My name is Sam. This is my brother, Dean. (DEAN waves)"
1,7,DEAN,Hi.
1,7,SAM,We just transferred here to the university.
1,7,LORI,I saw you inside.
1,7,SAM,We don’t wanna bother you. We just heard about what happened and...
1,7,DEAN,We wanted to say how sorry we were.
1,7,SAM,I kind of know what you’re going through. I-I saw someone..get hurt once. It’s something you don’t forget. (LORI nods slightly. REV. SORENSEN walks up to them.)
1,7,LORI,"Dad, um, this is Sam and Dean. They’re new students. (DEAN shakes the reverend’s hand.)"
1,7,DEAN,"It’s a pleasure to meet you, sir. I must say, that was an inspiring sermon."
1,7,REV. SORENSEN,Thank you very much. It’s so nice to find young people who are open to the Lord’s message. (DEAN chuckles.)
1,7,LORI,"Well, they don’t have a lot to go on. I think they blame me for that."
1,7,SAM,What do you mean?
1,7,LORI,"My story. I was so scared, I guess I was “seeing things”. (They stop walking.)"
1,7,SAM,That doesn’t mean it wasn’t real. (They look at each other for a few seconds.)
1,7,(CUT TO,INT.- library.)
1,7,DEAN,So you believe her?
1,7,SAM,I do.
1,7,DEAN,"Yeah, I think she’s hot, too."
1,7,DEAN,"Wait, the body suspended? That sounds like the—"
1,7,SAM,"Yeah, I know, the Hook Man legend."
1,7,DEAN,That’s one of the most famous urban legends ever. You don’t think that we’re dealing with the Hook Man.
1,7,SAM,Every urban legend has a source. A place where it all began.
1,7,DEAN,"Yeah, but what about the phantom scratches and the tire punctures and the invisible killer?"
1,7,SAM,"Well, maybe the Hook Man isn’t a man at all. What if it’s some kind of spirit?"
1,7,(CUT TO,DEAN and SAM at a table in the library. The librarian places a few big boxes in front of them.)
1,7,LIBRARIAN,Ok. (She walks away.)
1,7,DEAN,"So, this is how you spent four good years of your life, huh?"
1,7,SAM,Welcome to higher education. (They begin reading.)
1,7,(CUT TO,Hours later. They are still looking.)
1,7,SAM,"Hey, check this out. 1862. A preacher named Jacob Karns was arrested for murder. Looks like he was so angry over the red light district in town that one night he killed 13 prostitutes. Uh, right here, “some of the deceased were found in their bed, sheets soaked with blood. Others suspended upside down from the limbs of trees as a warning against sins of the flesh.”"
1,7,DEAN,"(looking at another page) Get this, the murder weapon? Looks like the preacher lost his hand in an accident. Had it replaced with a silver hook. (SAM points to another page.)"
1,7,SAM,Look where all this happened. (DEAN reads.)
1,7,DEAN,9 Mile Road.
1,7,SAM,Same place where the frat boy was killed.
1,7,DEAN,"(impressed) Nice job, Dr. Venkmen. Let’s check it out. (SAM gathers all the research and they leave.)"
1,7,(CUT TO,LORI’s sorority. REV. SORENSEN pulls up in the driveway.)
1,7,LORI,I know this is your first time really living alone since Mom died.
1,7,REV. SORENSEN,That’s not it. I worry about you.
1,7,LORI,There are 22 girls in there and perfectly safe.
1,7,REV. SORENSEN,That’s exactly what I’m worried about. You don’t think I know what goes on in there?
1,7,LORI,"Dad, do we have to have this argument again? I’m over 18. I can live my own life."
1,7,REV. SORENSEN,"Oh, which means, drinking, partying with that roommate of yours!"
1,7,LORI,I’m an adult. I can take care of myself. Good night. (She gets out of the car.)
1,7,REV. SORENSEN,"Lori. Lori, come—Lori! (She slams the door and leaves.)"
1,7,(CUT TO,"INT.- LORI’s sorority building. LORI is walking up the stairs and stops at a girl’s bedroom doorway. There is a long scratch on the wall leading up to the doorway. Inside, the girl is working at her computer. LORI ignores it and walks into her bedroom. She is about to turn on the light when she sees TAYLOR sleeping and stops herself.)"
1,7,LORI,"Taylor, you awake? (TAYLOR doesn’t wake up. LORI leaves her alone and goes into her bathroom to get ready for bed.)"
1,7,(CUT TO,9 Mile Road. DEAN and SAM drive up and get out of the car. DEAN opens the trunk and hands SAM a rifle.)
1,7,DEAN,Here you go.
1,7,SAM,"If it is a spirit, buckshot won’t do much good."
1,7,DEAN,"Yeah, rock salt. (He hands it to SAM.)"
1,7,SAM,Huh. Salt being a spirit deterrent. (DEAN takes out a coil of rope and shuts the trunk.)
1,7,DEAN,Yeah. It won’t kill ‘em. But it’ll slow ‘em down. (They start walking towards the trees.)
1,7,SAM,That’s pretty good. You and Dad think of this?
1,7,DEAN,I told you. You don’t have to be a college graduate to be a genius. (They hear noises among the trees and stop walking. SAM raises his gun and looks around.)
1,7,DEAN,(whispering) Over there. Over there. (Sam aims the gun and cocks it. A figure comes out from behind the trees. It is a sheriff.)
1,7,SHERIFF,Put the gun down now! Now! Put your hands behind your head.
1,7,DEAN,"W-w-wait, okay, okay!"
1,7,SHERIFF,"Now get down on your knees. Come on, do it! On your knees! (They get down.) Now get down on your bellies. Come on, do it!"
1,7,DEAN,He had the gun! (They lay down.)
1,7,(CUT TO,"LORI and TAYLOR’s bedroom. LORI comes out of the bathroom in her pajamas, watches TAYLOR shift in her sleep, and gets into bed. The camera pans over to the open closet, where the Hook Man is seen waiting.)"
1,7,(CUT TO,"LORI’s bedroom. Morning. LORI rolls over in her bed and opens her eyes. She sees a puddle of blood on the floor. The camera moves up and shows blood dripping from TAYLOR’s bed. TAYLOR is shown, dead. There is blood everywhere.)"
1,7,LORI,"Oh my God. (She screams. She looks on the wall near TAYLOR’s bed. Written in blood are the words “Aren’t you glad you didn’t turn on the light?” Underneath the words is a large cross with four smaller crosses surrounding it, also written in blood. LORI screams and the screen goes black.)"
1,7,(CUT TO,EXT.- CALUMET CO. SHERIFF’S DEPT. DEAN and SAM are leaving.)
1,7,DEAN,"Saved your ass! Talked the sheriff down to a fine. Dude, I am Matlock."
1,7,SAM,But how?
1,7,DEAN,I told him you were a dumbass pledge and that we were hazing you.
1,7,SAM,What about the shotgun?
1,7,DEAN,"I said that you were hunting ghosts and the spirits were repelled by rock salt. You know, typical Hell Week prank."
1,7,SAM,And he believed you?
1,7,DEAN,"Well, you look like a dumbass pledge. (Seconds later, several sheriffs run out of the building and speed away in police cars. SAM and DEAN exchange a look.)"
1,7,(CUT TO,"EXT.- LORI’s sorority building. LORI is wrapped in a blanket, sitting in the back of a parked ambulance. SAM and DEAN drive by and look at her.)"
1,7,REV. SORENSEN,I just want to take her home.
1,7,SHERIFF,"I understand that, Reverend. But Lori’s now connected to two murders, and I can’t ignore that."
1,7,REV. SORENSEN,"Listen to me. Arrest her now, or let me take her home. (The sheriff thinks about it for a second.)"
1,7,SHERIFF,Make sure she’s available for questioning.
1,7,REV. SORENSEN,"Thank you. (He walks over to LORI.) Sweetheart, you ready to go home? (She stands up and starts walking with him. DEAN and SAM park their car on another street. They get out and walk around to the back of LORI’s sorority.)"
1,7,SAM,Why would the Hook Man come here? This is a long way from 9 Mile Road.
1,7,SAM,Be quiet.
1,7,DEAN,You be quiet!
1,7,SAM,You be quiet!
1,7,(CUT TO,"INT.- LORI’s walk-in closet. SAM opens the door slightly and sees another sheriff leaving the bedroom. SAM waits until the sheriff goes downstairs and then opens the closet door. Once in LORI’s bedroom, SAM and DEAN see the writing on the wall.)"
1,7,SAM,“Aren’t you glad you didn’t turn on the light?” That’s right out of the legend.
1,7,DEAN,"Yeah, that’s classic Hook Man all right. (He taps his nose.) It’s definitely a spirit."
1,7,SAM,"Yeah, I’ve never smelled ozone this strong before. (DEAN moves over to the window.) Hey, come here. (DEAN walks over to SAM. SAM points to the cross symbol beneath the writing.) Does that look familiar to you?"
1,7,(CUT TO,DEAN and SAM next to the car. They are looking at a picture of the cross symbol that they found during their research.)
1,7,SAM,It’s the same symbol. Seems like it is the spirit of Jacob Karns.
1,7,DEAN,"All right, let’s find the dude’s grave, salt and burn the bones, and put him down."
1,7,SAM,"(reading) “After execution, Jacob Karns was laid to rest in an Old North Cemetery. In an unmarked grave.” (They both look annoyed.)"
1,7,DEAN,Super.
1,7,SAM,Ok. So we know it’s Jacob Karns. But we still don’t know where he’ll manifest next. Or why.
1,7,DEAN,I’ll take a wild guess about why. I think your little friend Lori has something to do with this. (They get in the car.)
1,7,(CUT TO,INT.- college party. DEAN walks up to SAM.)
1,7,SAM,Hey.
1,7,DEAN,"Man, you’ve been holding out on me. This college thing is awesome! (He winks and smiles at a passing girl.)"
1,7,SAM,This wasn’t really my experience.
1,7,DEAN,"Let me guess. Libraries, studying, straight A’s? (SAM nods.) What a geek. Alright, you do your homework?"
1,7,SAM,"Yeah. It was bugging me, right? So how is the Hook Man tied up with Lori? So I think I came up with something. (He unravels a piece of paper.)"
1,7,DEAN,1932. Clergyman arrested for murder. 1967. Seminarian held in hippie rampage.
1,7,SAM,"There’s a pattern here. In both cases, the suspect was a man of religion who openly preached against immorality. And then found himself wanted for killings he claimed were the work of an invisible force. Killings carried out—get this—with a sharp instrument."
1,7,DEAN,What’s the connection to Lori?
1,7,SAM,"A man of religion? Who openly preaches against immorality? (DEAN suddenly understands.) Except maybe this time, instead of saving the whole town, he’s just trying to save his only daughter."
1,7,DEAN,Reverend Sorensen. You think he’s summoning the spirit?
1,7,SAM,"Maybe. Or, you know how a poltergeist can haunt a person instead of a place?"
1,7,DEAN,"Yeah, the spirit latches onto the reverend’s repressed emotions, feeds off them, yeah, okay."
1,7,SAM,Without the reverend ever even knowing it.
1,7,DEAN,"Either way, you should keep an eye on Lori tonight. (SAM nods.)"
1,7,SAM,What about you? (DEAN looks at an attractive blonde smiling at him by the pool table.)
1,7,DEAN,"(reluctantly) I’m gonna go see if I can find that unmarked grave. (He looks at the blonde again, shakes his head in disappointment, and walks away.)"
1,7,(CUT TO,Old North Cemetery. Night. DEAN is looking around with a flashlight. He comes across a headstone that is engraved with the cross symbol.)
1,7,DEAN,Here we go. (He walks over to it)
1,7,(CUT TO,"EXT.- REV. SORENSEN’s house. Through the window, SAM can see LORI and her father arguing inside.)"
1,7,(CUT TO,Old North Cemetery. DEAN has been digging at the unmarked grave for a while.)
1,7,DEAN,"That’s it. Next time, I get to watch the cute girl’s house. (He breaks through the wooden floor of the grave and sees Jacob Karns’ remains.) Hello, preacher. (He throws his shovel aside.)"
1,7,(CUT TO,EXT.- REV. SORENSEN’s house. SAM watches REV. SORENSEN turn out the light and leave the room. LORI comes outside and sits down next to him on a bench.)
1,7,LORI,About me?
1,7,SAM,Yeah. Sorry.
1,7,LORI,"No, it’s cool. I already called the cops. (She smiles. SAM laughs.) No, seriously. I think you’re sweet. Which is probably why you should run away from me as fast as you can."
1,7,SAM,Why would you say that?
1,7,LORI,It’s like I’m cursed or something. People around me keep dying.
1,7,SAM,I think I know how you feel.
1,7,(CUT TO,Old North Cemetery. DEAN takes a few items out of his bag. He pours salt and lighter fluid on the preacher’s bones then lights a match.)
1,7,DEAN,"Goodbye, preacher. (He throws the match into the grave and watches the bones burn into flames)"
1,7,(CUT TO,EXT.- REV. SORENSEN’s house.)
1,7,LORI,No one will talk to me anymore. Except you. The sheriff thinks I’m a suspect. And you know what my dad will say? Pray. Have faith. What does he know about faith?
1,7,SAM,I heard you guys fighting before.
1,7,LORI,"He’s seeing a woman. A married woman. I just found out. She comes to our church with her husband. I know her kids. And he talks to me about religion? About morality? It’s like, on one hand, you know, just do what you want and be happy. But he taught me, raised me to believe that if you do something wrong you will get punished. I just don’t know what to think anymore. (She hugs SAM. He is slightly confused, but he hugs her back. They begin to kiss but SAM pulls away.) Sam?"
1,7,SAM,"Lori, I can’t."
1,7,LORI,That someone you lost? (SAM stares at her) I’m sorry. (REV. SORENSEN comes outside.)
1,7,REV. SORENSEN,"Lori? Come inside, please."
1,7,LORI,"(getting angry) I’ll come in when I’m ready. (Suddenly, the Hook Man appears behind REV. SORENSEN and puts his hook into his shoulder. The reverend screams and the Hook Man slams the door shut. SAM grabs his gun and runs into the house. He looks around and hears REV. SORENSEN screaming upstairs.)"
1,7,REV. SORENSEN,"(OS) No! No, please! No! (SAM runs upstairs and sees the reverend’s bedroom door shutting. He runs into the bedroom and sees the Hook Man on top of REV. SORENSEN, about to put his hook into the reverend.) No! No, no! (SAM shoots the Hook Man in the side. The Hook Man turns to SAM, who shoots him again. The Hook Man turns to dust and the gun blast shatters the bedroom window. LORI is running up the stairs.)"
1,7,LORI,"Dad! Dad! (She bursts through the bedroom window and kneels down next to her dad.) Okay. It’s ok, Dad, it’s ok. It’s ok. (SAM watches them as the screen goes black.)"
1,7,(CUT TO,INT.- hospital. REV. SORENSEN is in a hospital bed and LORI is standing by his side. SAM is talking to the sheriff.)
1,7,SAM,We were just talking. Then Lori’s dad came out. And then he appeared.
1,7,SHERIFF,"A big man? Carrying a weapon, some kind of hook?"
1,7,SAM,"Yes, sir."
1,7,SHERIFF,Ever seen him before?
1,7,SAM,"No, sir."
1,7,SHERIFF,"Son, it seems every time I turn around, I’m seeing you. I suggest you try to stay out of trouble (SAM nods.)"
1,7,SAM,"Yes, sir. (DEAN and two sheriffs are walking down the hall.)"
1,7,DEAN,"No, it’s alright, I’m with him. He’s my brother. (to SAM) Hey! Brother! (SAM and the sheriff turn to see DEAN. DEAN smiles and waves.)"
1,7,SHERIFF,Let him through. (The two sheriffs let DEAN through.)
1,7,DEAN,Thanks. (He and SAM walk towards each other.) You ok?
1,7,SAM,Yeah.
1,7,DEAN,What the hell happened?
1,7,SAM,Hook Man.
1,7,DEAN,You saw him?
1,7,SAM,Damn right. Why didn’t you torch the bones?
1,7,DEAN,"What are you talking about, I did. You sure it’s the spirit of Jacob Karns?"
1,7,SAM,It sure as hell looked like him. And that’s not all. I don’t think the spirit is latching on to the reverend.
1,7,DEAN,"Well, yeah, the guy wouldn’t send the Hook Man after himself."
1,7,SAM,I think it’s latching onto Lori. Last night she found out her father is having an affair with a married woman.
1,7,DEAN,So what?
1,7,SAM,"So she’s upset about it. She’s upset about the immorality of it. She told me she was raised to believe that if you do something wrong, you get punished."
1,7,DEAN,"Ok, so she’s conflicted. And the spirit of Preacher Karns is latching on to repress the emotions and maybe he’s doing the punishing for her, huh?"
1,7,SAM,"Right. Rich comes on too strong, Taylor tries to make her into a party girl, Dad has an affair."
1,7,DEAN,"Remind me not to piss this girl off. But I burned those bones, I buried them in salt, why didn’t that stop him?"
1,7,SAM,You must have missed something.
1,7,DEAN,No. I burned everything in that coffin.
1,7,SAM,Did you get the hook?
1,7,DEAN,The hook?
1,7,SAM,"Well, it was the murder weapon, and in a way, it was part of him."
1,7,DEAN,"So, like the bones, the hook is a source of his power."
1,7,SAM,So if we find the hook...
1,7,(CUT TO,INT.- library. SAM and DEAN are looking through more papers.)
1,7,SAM,Does it mention the hook?
1,7,DEAN,"Yeah, maybe. (reading) Upon execution, all earthly items shall be remanded to the prisoner’s house of worship, St. Barnabas Church."
1,7,SAM,Isn’t that where Lori’s father preaches?
1,7,DEAN,Yeah.
1,7,SAM,Where Lori lives?
1,7,DEAN,Maybe that’s why the Hook Man has been haunting reverends and reverends’ daughters for the past 200 years.
1,7,SAM,"Yeah, but if the hook were at the church or Lori’s house, don’t you think someone might’ve seen it? I mean, a bloodstained, silver-handled hook?"
1,7,DEAN,Check the church records.
1,7,(CUT TO,INT.- library. They are still researching.)
1,7,SAM,"(reading) St. Barnabas donations, 1862. Received silver-handled hook from state penitentiary. Reforged. (sighs) They melted it down. Made it into something else."
1,7,(CUT TO,EXT.- St. Barnabas Church. DEAN and SAM park the car and get out.)
1,7,DEAN,"Alright, we can’t take any chances. Anything silver goes in the fire."
1,7,SAM,"I agree. So, Lori’s still at the hospital. We’ll have to break in."
1,7,DEAN,"Alright, take your pick."
1,7,SAM,I’ll take the house.
1,7,DEAN,Ok. (SAM begins walking towards REV. SORENSEN’s house.) Hey. (SAM turns around.) Stay out of her underwear drawer. (He walks away.)
1,7,(CUT TO,INT.- St. Barnabas Church. Basement. DEAN is throwing everything silver into the fire. SAM comes downstairs with a bag of things from LORI’s house.)
1,7,SAM,I got everything that even looked silver.
1,7,DEAN,"Better safe than sorry. (They throw everything into the fire. Suddenly, they hear footsteps above them.) Move, move. (He takes his gun and goes upstairs with SAM.)"
1,7,(CUT TO,"INT.- St. Barnabas Church. Upstairs. DEAN and SAM see that LORI is sitting in a pew alone, crying. DEAN lowers his gun and goes back downstairs. SAM walks over to LORI.)"
1,7,SAM,Lori?
1,7,LORI,What are you doing here?
1,7,SAM,What is it?
1,7,LORI,I’ve been trying to understand what’s been happening. Why? Now I know so I’m praying for forgiveness.
1,7,SAM,Forgiveness for what?
1,7,LORI,Don’t you see? I’m to blame for all this. I’ve read in the Bible about avenging angels.
1,7,SAM,"Trust me, this guy—he’s no angel."
1,7,LORI,I was so angry at my father. Part of me wanted him punished. And then he came and he punished him.
1,7,SAM,It’s not your fault.
1,7,LORI,"Yes, it is. I don’t know how, but it is. (In the back of the church, the Hook Man appears for a moment then disappears quickly.) I killed Rich. Taylor, too. I nearly killed my father."
1,7,SAM,Lori...
1,7,LORI,I can see it now. They didn’t deserve to be punished. I do. (They hear a noise come from the front of the church. The candles at the altar blow out and the screen fades to black.)
1,7,(FADE IN,LORI and SAM in the church.)
1,7,SAM,"Come on. We gotta go. (He leads her away and opens the door to the basement. But the Hook Man is behind it and pushes his hook through the door.) Go! (SAM and LORI run down the aisle and into a back room. The Hook Man follows them and smashes the glass of another door with his hook. He swings at SAM a few times but misses. The Hook Man chases the two of them around the room and finally hooks SAM in the shoulder. He screams in pain and an invisible force drags LORI on her back across the floor. SAM runs over to her.) Come on. You okay? (The Hook Man appears and knocks SAM backwards into a wall. He gets up and maneuvers behind the Hook Man, who is standing over LORI. DEAN suddenly enters with his gun raised.)"
1,7,DEAN,"Sam, drop! (SAM crouches down and DEAN shoots the Hook Man once. He disappears into dust.)"
1,7,SAM,I thought we got all the silver.
1,7,DEAN,So did I.
1,7,SAM,Then why is he still here?
1,7,DEAN,"Well, maybe we missed something! (They look around. SAM notices a cross necklace that LORI is wearing.)"
1,7,SAM,"Lori, where did you get that chain?"
1,7,LORI,My father gave it to me.
1,7,DEAN,Where’d your dad get it?
1,7,LORI,"He said it was a church heirloom, he gave it to me when I started school."
1,7,SAM,Is it silver?!
1,7,LORI,"Yes! (SAM rips the chain off from around her neck. In the hallway, the Hook Man, who is now invisible, is making a long scratch on the wall. DEAN turns around to look at it.)"
1,7,DEAN,Sam! (DEAN throws SAM the rifle and the rock salt and SAM tosses DEAN the necklace. DEAN runs back downstairs. SAM aims the gun at the scratch that is being made and shoots. He quickly reloads the gun with rock salt.)
1,7,(CUT TO,Basement. DEAN runs downstairs and throws LORI’s necklace into the fire.)
1,7,(CUT TO,Upstairs. SAM is still loading the gun with his injured hand and shoulder. The Hook Man appears and knocks the rifle out of SAM’s hand. SAM and LORI crawl into the corner and watch the Hook Man tower over them.)
1,7,(CUT TO,"Basement. In the fire, the cross pendant breaks off the chain and melts.)"
1,7,(CUT TO,Upstairs. The Hook Man stops with his hook in the air. The hook melts and the rest of his body burns into nothing. DEAN runs upstairs to make sure the Hook Man is gone. He walks over to SAM and LORI and gives them a knowing look. The screen fades to black.)
1,7,(FADE IN,EXT.- St. Barnabus Church. Sheriffs are walking around and there is an ambulance parked outside.)
1,7,SHERIFF,"And you saw him, too? The man with the hook?"
1,7,DEAN,"Yes, I told you, we all saw him. We fought him off and then he ran."
1,7,SHERIFF,And that’s all?
1,7,DEAN,"Yeah, that’s all."
1,7,SHERIFF,Listen. You and your brother—
1,7,DEAN,"Oh, don’t worry, we’re leaving town. (He walks over to his car.)"
1,7,(CUT TO,the ambulance. LORI watches SAM finish getting bandaged up.)
1,7,LORI,You gonna be okay?
1,7,SAM,"Yeah. (Back at the car, DEAN is watching SAM and LORI through his side view mirror.)"
1,7,LORI,"I still don’t know what happened. But I do know you saved my life. My father’s, too. Thank you. (SAM nods and smiles. DEAN watches through the mirror and notices SAM just walks away without another word. SAM walks to the car and gets in.)"
1,7,DEAN,"We could stay. (SAM shakes his head. DEAN watches LORI looking sad, through the mirror. He shakes his head in disappointment and drives away. The screen fades to black.)"
1,9,SARI,Mommy? [JENNY looks up.]
1,9,JENNY,"Hey, sweetie. Why aren’t you in bed?"
1,9,SARI,There’s something in my closet.
1,9,[CUT TO,SARI’S BEDROOM. JENNY opens the closet doors and looks inside as SARI watches from her bed.]
1,9,JENNY,See? There’s nothing there.
1,9,SARI,You sure?
1,9,JENNY,"I’m sure. Now, come on. Get into bed. [SARI crawls into bed and JENNY tucks her in.]"
1,9,SARI,I don’t like this house.
1,9,JENNY,You’re just not used to it yet. But you and your brother and me –- we are going to be very happy here. I promise. [She kisses SARI on her forehead.] I love you. [She turns off the light and gets up to leave the room.]
1,9,SARI,The chair.
1,9,JENNY,Okay. [She moves a chair under the doorknob of the closet.] The chair. Just to be safe. [SARI lies down and goes to bed. JENNY leaves.]
1,9,JENNY,"Please, God, don’t let it be rats."
1,9,JENNY,Terrific.
1,9,[FADE IN,"MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT. While SAM is sleeping, he begins dreaming of JENNY. She is inside her bedroom, screaming for help. SAM wakes up, confused.]"
1,9,DEAN,"All right. I’ve been cruisin’ some websites. I think I found a few candidates for our next gig. A fishing trawler found off the coast of Cali –- its crew vanished. And, uh, we got some cattle mutilations in West Texas. Hey. [SAM looks up from his drawing.] Am I boring you with this hunting evil stuff?"
1,9,SAM,No. I’m listening. Keep going.
1,9,DEAN,"And, here, a Sacramento man shot himself in the head. Three times. [He waves his hand in front of SAM’S face.] Any of these things blowin’ up your skirt, pal?"
1,9,SAM,[looking at his picture] Wait. I’ve seen this.
1,9,DEAN,Seen what? [SAM gets up from the bed and goes searching through his duffel bag.] What are you doing? [SAM finds a photo of their family from when he was a baby. He compares the tree in the photo to his drawing. They are the same.]
1,9,SAM,"Dean, I know where we have to go next."
1,9,DEAN,Where?
1,9,SAM,Back home –- back to Kansas.
1,9,DEAN,"Okay, random. Where’d that come from?"
1,9,SAM,"[showing the photo to DEAN] All right, um, this photo was taken in front of our old house, right? The house where Mom died?"
1,9,DEAN,Yeah.
1,9,SAM,"And it didn’t burn down, right? I mean, not completely, they rebuilt it, right?"
1,9,DEAN,"I guess so, yeah. What the hell are you talkin’ about?"
1,9,SAM,"Okay, look, this is gonna sound crazy but….the people who live in our old house –- I think they might be in danger."
1,9,DEAN,Why would you think that?
1,9,SAM,"Uh…it’s just, um….look, just trust me on this, okay? [He starts to walk away, and DEAN follows him.]"
1,9,DEAN,"Wait, whoa, whoa, trust you?"
1,9,SAM,Yeah.
1,9,DEAN,"Come on, man, that’s weak. You gotta give me a little bit more than that."
1,9,SAM,I can’t really explain it is all.
1,9,DEAN,"Well, tough. I’m not goin’ anywhere until you do. [SAM sighs. DEAN waits expectantly.]"
1,9,SAM,I have these nightmares.
1,9,DEAN,[nodding] I’ve noticed.
1,9,SAM,And sometimes….they come true.
1,9,DEAN,[stunned] Come again?
1,9,SAM,"Look, Dean….I dreamt about Jessica’s death –- for days before it happened."
1,9,DEAN,"Sam, people have weird dreams, man. I’m sure it’s just a coincidence. [He sits down on the bed.]"
1,9,SAM,"No, I dreamt about the blood dripping, her on the ceiling, the fire, everything, and I didn’t do anything about it ‘cause I didn’t believe it. And now I’m dreaming about that tree, about our house, and about some woman inside screaming for help. I mean, that’s where it all started, man, this has to mean something, right?"
1,9,DEAN,[overwhelmed] I don’t know.
1,9,SAM,"[sitting down across from DEAN] What do you mean you don’t know, Dean? This woman might be in danger. I mean, this might even be the thing that killed Mom and Jessica!"
1,9,DEAN,"All right, just slow down, would ya? [He stands up and begins pacing.] I mean, first you tell me that you’ve got the Shining? And then you tell me that I’ve gotta go back home? Especially when…."
1,9,SAM,When what?
1,9,DEAN,[sadly] When I swore to myself that I would never go back there?
1,9,SAM,"[softly] Look, Dean, we have to check this out. Just to make sure."
1,9,DEAN,I know we do.
1,9,[CUT TO,EXT – WINCHESTER HOUSE. DEAN and SAM pull up outside the house.]
1,9,SAM,"You gonna be all right, man?"
1,9,DEAN,"Let me get back to you on that. [They get out of the car. After knocking on the front door, JENNY answers it. SAM is shocked that she is the same woman from his dream.]"
1,9,JENNY,Yes?
1,9,DEAN,"Sorry to bother you, ma’am, but we’re with the Federal—"
1,9,SAM,"I’m Sam Winchester, and this is my brother, Dean. We used to live here. You know, we were just drivin’ by, and we were wondering if we could come see the old place."
1,9,JENNY,"Winchester. Yeah, that’s so funny. You know, I think I found some of your photos the other night."
1,9,DEAN,You did? [JENNY nods and steps aside.]
1,9,JENNY,Come on in. [They go inside.]
1,9,RITCHIE,Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
1,9,JENNY,"That’s Ritchie. He’s kind of a juice junkie. [She takes a sippy cup out of the refrigerator and hands it to RITCHIE.] But, hey, at least he won’t get scurvy. [She walks over to SARI.] Sari, this is Sam and Dean. They used to live here."
1,9,SARI,Hi. [DEAN waves.]
1,9,SAM,"Hey, Sari."
1,9,DEAN,"So, you just moved in?"
1,9,JENNY,"Yeah, from Wichita."
1,9,DEAN,"You got family here, or….?"
1,9,JENNY,"No. I just, uh….needed a fresh start, that’s all. So, new town, new job –- I mean, as soon as I find one. New house."
1,9,SAM,"So, how you likin’ it so far?"
1,9,JENNY,"Well, uh, all due respect to your childhood home –- I mean, I’m sure you had lots of happy memories here. [DEAN smiles weakly.] But this place has its issues."
1,9,SAM,What do you mean?
1,9,JENNY,"Well, it’s just getting old. Like the wiring, you know? We’ve got flickering lights almost hourly."
1,9,DEAN,"Oh, that’s too bad. What else?"
1,9,JENNY,"Um…sink’s backed up, there’s rats in the basement. [She pauses.] I’m sorry. I don’t mean to complain."
1,9,DEAN,[not offended] No. Have you seen the rats or have you just heard scratching?
1,9,JENNY,"It’s just the scratching, actually."
1,9,SARI,Mom? [JENNY kneels down next to her.] Ask them if it was here when they lived here.
1,9,SAM,"What, Sari?"
1,9,SARI,The thing in my closet.
1,9,JENNY,"Oh, no, baby, there was nothing in their closets. [to SAM and DEAN] Right?"
1,9,SAM,"Right. No, no, of course not."
1,9,JENNY,She had a nightmare the other night.
1,9,SARI,I wasn’t dreaming. It came into my bedroom –- and it was on fire. [SAM and DEAN are shocked.]
1,9,[CUT TO,EXT. – WINCHESTER HOUSE. DEAN and SAM are walking back to the car.]
1,9,SAM,You hear that? A figure on fire.
1,9,DEAN,"And that woman, Jenny, that was the woman in your dreams?"
1,9,SAM,"Yeah. And you hear what she was talking about? Scratching, flickering lights, both signs of a malevolent spirit."
1,9,DEAN,"Yeah, well, I’m just freaked out that your weirdo visions are comin’ true."
1,9,SAM,"[panicked] Well, forget about that for a minute. The thing in the house, do you think it’s the thing that killed Mom and Jessica?"
1,9,DEAN,I don’t know!
1,9,SAM,"Well, I mean, has it come back or has it been here the whole time?"
1,9,DEAN,"Or maybe it’s something else entirely, Sam, we don’t know yet."
1,9,SAM,"Well, those people are in danger, Dean. We have to get ‘em out of that house."
1,9,DEAN,And we will.
1,9,SAM,"No, I mean now."
1,9,DEAN,"And how you gonna do that, huh? You got a story that she’s gonna believe?"
1,9,SAM,Then what are we supposed to do?
1,9,[CUT TO,GAS STATION.]
1,9,DEAN,"We just gotta chill out, that’s all. You know, if this was any other kind of job, what would we do? [SAM sighs.]"
1,9,SAM,We’d try to figure out what we were dealin’ with. We’d dig into the history of the house.
1,9,DEAN,"Exactly, except this time, we already know what happened."
1,9,SAM,"Yeah, but how much do we know? I mean, how much do you actually remember?"
1,9,DEAN,"About that night, you mean?"
1,9,SAM,Yeah.
1,9,DEAN,Not much. I remember the fire…the heat. [He pauses for a moment.] And then I carried you out the front door.
1,9,SAM,You did?
1,9,DEAN,"Yeah, what, you never knew that?"
1,9,SAM,[shaking his head.] No.
1,9,DEAN,"And, well, you know Dad’s story as well as I do. Mom was….was on the ceiling. And whatever put her there was long gone by the time Dad found her."
1,9,SAM,And he never had a theory about what did it?
1,9,DEAN,"If he did, he kept it to himself. God knows we asked him enough times."
1,9,SAM,"Okay. So, if we’re gonna figure out what’s goin’ on now…we have to figure out what happened back then. And see if it’s the same thing."
1,9,DEAN,"Yeah. We’ll talk to Dad’s friends, neighbors, people who were there at the time."
1,9,SAM,[after a pause] Does this feel like just another job to you? [DEAN says nothing for a moment.]
1,9,DEAN,"I’ll be right back. I gotta go to the bathroom. [He walks away. After turning a corner, he stands next to the bathroom door and takes out his cell phone. After making sure no one can see him, he dials a number.]"
1,9,VOICEMAIL,"This is John Winchester. If this is an emergency, call my son, Dean at 866-907-3235. [The beep sounds.]"
1,9,DEAN,"Dad? I know I’ve left you messages before. I don’t even know if you’ll get ‘em. [He clears his throat.] But I’m with Sam. And we’re in Lawrence. And there’s somethin’ in our old house. I don’t know if it’s the thing that killed Mom or not, but….[His voice breaks. He pauses, barely keeping himself together.]…I don’t know what to do. [He begins to cry.] So, whatever you’re doin’, if you could get here. Please. I need your help, Dad. [He hangs up sadly, with tears in his eyes.]"
1,9,[CUT TO,"INT. – WINCHESTER HOUSE. JENNY is showing a plumber to the kitchen, near the sink.]"
1,9,JENNY,"No, sir, nothing weird down there, I promise. Sink just backed up on its own."
1,9,PLUMBER,"Well, I’ll take a look."
1,9,JENNY,"Thanks. Oh, okay, I’ll get out of your way."
1,9,[FADE IN,GUENTHER’S AUTO REPAIR. DEAN and SAM are talking to the owner of the garage.]
1,9,DEAN,"So you and John Winchester, you used to own this garage together?"
1,9,OWNER,"Yeah, we used to, a long time ago. Matter of fact, it must be, uh…twenty years since John disappeared. So why the cops interested all of a sudden?"
1,9,DEAN,"Oh, we’re re-opening some of our unsolved cases, and the Winchester disappearance is one of ‘em."
1,9,OWNER,"Oh, well, what do you wanna know about John?"
1,9,DEAN,"Well, whatever you remember, you know, whatever sticks out in your mind."
1,9,OWNER,"Well…he was a stubborn bastard, I remember that. [He laughs.] And, uh, whatever the game, he hated to lose, you know? It’s that whole Marine thing. [DEAN and SAM nod.] But, oh, he sure loved Mary. And he doted on those kids."
1,9,SAM,But that was before the fire?
1,9,OWNER,That’s right.
1,9,SAM,He ever talk about that night?
1,9,OWNER,"No, not at first. I think he was in shock."
1,9,SAM,Right. But eventually? What did he say about it?
1,9,OWNER,"Oh, he wasn’t thinkin’ straight. He said somethin’ caused that fire and killed Mary."
1,9,DEAN,He ever say what did it?
1,9,OWNER,"Nothin’ did it. It was an accident –- an electrical short in the ceiling or walls or somethin’. I begged him to get some help, but…."
1,9,DEAN,But what?
1,9,OWNER,"Oh, he just got worse and worse."
1,9,DEAN,How?
1,9,OWNER,"Oh, he started readin’ these strange ol’ books. He started goin’ to see this palm reader in town."
1,9,DEAN,"Palm reader? Uh, do you have a name?"
1,9,OWNER,[scoffs] No.
1,9,[CUT TO,"IMPALA. The car is parked by a payphone, where SAM is looking through a phonebook.]"
1,9,SAM,"All right, so there are a few psychics and palm readers in town. There’s someone named El Divino. There’s, uh –-[He laughs.]—there’s the Mysterious Mister Fortinsky. Uh, Missouri Moseley—"
1,9,DEAN,"Wait, wait. Missouri Moseley?"
1,9,SAM,What?
1,9,DEAN,That’s a psychic?
1,9,SAM,"Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess so. [DEAN goes into the backseat of the car and pulls out John’s journal.]"
1,9,DEAN,"In Dad’s journal…here, look at this. [He opens to the first page.] First page, first sentence, read that."
1,9,SAM,[reading] I went to Missouri and I learned the truth.
1,9,DEAN,[shrugging] I always thought he meant the state.
1,9,[CUT TO,"INT – MISSOURI’S HOUSE. MISSOURI MOSELEY is escorting a man out of the house while DEAN and SAM sit on the couch, waiting.]"
1,9,MISSOURI,"All right, there. Don’t you worry ‘bout a thing. Your wife is crazy about you. [The man thanks her and she closes the front door behind him.] Whew. Poor bastard. His woman is cold-bangin’ the gardener."
1,9,DEAN,Why didn’t you tell him?
1,9,MISSOURI,"People don’t come here for the truth. They come for good news. [The boys stare at her.] Well? Sam and Dean, come on already, I ain’t got all day. [She leaves the room. DEAN and SAM exchange a confused look and follow her into the next room.] Well, lemme look at ya. [She laughs.] Oh, you boys grew up handsome. [She points a finger at DEAN.] And you were one goofy-lookin’ kid, too. [DEAN glares at her while SAM smirks.] Sam. [She grabs his hand.] Oh, honey…I’m sorry about your girlfriend. [The boys are shocked.] And your father –- he’s missin’?"
1,9,SAM,How’d you know all that?
1,9,MISSOURI,"Well, you were just thinkin’ it just now. [SAM raises his eyebrows, surprised.]"
1,9,DEAN,"Well, where is he? Is he okay?"
1,9,MISSOURI,I don’t know.
1,9,DEAN,"Don’t know? Well, you’re supposed to be a psychic, right?"
1,9,MISSOURI,"Boy, you see me sawin’ some bony tramp in half? You think I’m a magician? I may be able to read thoughts and sense energies in a room, but I can’t just pull facts out of thin air. Sit, please. [SAM smirks at DEAN and they sit down. MISSOURI snaps at DEAN.] Boy, you put your foot on my coffee table, I’m ‘a whack you with a spoon!"
1,9,DEAN,I didn’t do anything.
1,9,MISSOURI,But you were thinkin’ about it. [DEAN raises his eyebrows. SAM smiles.]
1,9,SAM,"Okay. So, our dad –- when did you first meet him?"
1,9,MISSOURI,He came for a reading. A few days after the fire. I just told him what was really out there in the dark. I guess you could say…I drew back the curtains for him.
1,9,DEAN,What about the fire? Do you know about what killed our mom?
1,9,MISSOURI,"A little. Your daddy took me to your house. He was hopin’ I could sense the echoes, the fingerprints of this thing."
1,9,SAM,And could you?
1,9,MISSOURI,I….[She shakes her head.]
1,9,SAM,What was it?
1,9,MISSOURI,"[softly] I don’t know. Oh, but it was evil."
1,9,[CUT TO,INT. – WINCHESTER HOUSE. JENNY is on the phone in the kitchen while RITCHIE jumps around in his playpen.]
1,9,JENNY,"Look, I feel just awful about the poor man’s hand. […] Wait, but how can I be held liable? […] Yeah, but I can’t afford a lawyer. [She begins to hear noises from upstairs.] Okay, listen, you just gotta let me call you back. [She hangs up.] Ritchie, um, Mommy’s gonna be right back, okay?"
1,9,RITCHIE,Okay. [JENNY leaves the room.]
1,9,[CUT TO,MISSOURI’S HOUSE.]
1,9,MISSOURI,So…you think somethin’ is back in that house?
1,9,SAM,Definitely.
1,9,MISSOURI,I don’t understand.
1,9,SAM,What?
1,9,MISSOURI,"I haven’t been back inside, but I’ve been keepin’ an eye on the place, and it’s been quiet. No sudden deaths, no freak accidents. Why is it actin’ up now?"
1,9,SAM,I don’t know. But Dad going missing and Jessica dying and now this house all happening at once –- it just feels like something’s starting.
1,9,DEAN,That’s a comforting thought.
1,9,[CUT TO,WINCHESTER HOUSE.]
1,9,RITCHIE,"Juicy. [He climbs into the refrigerator and sits on one of the shelves. Suddenly, the refrigerator door closes and the safety latch locks into place. The screen goes black.]"
1,9,[FADE IN,WINCHESTER HOUSE. JENNY returns to the kitchen.]
1,9,JENNY,"Oh, baby, either we have rats or Mommy’s going crazy. [She sees that the playpen is empty.] Ritchie? Ritchie?! [Panicked, she rushes into the other rooms and tries to find him.] Baby, where are you?! [She comes back into the kitchen, breathing heavily. She sees milk leaking out from inside the refrigerator. She goes over to it and opens the door.]"
1,9,RITCHIE,Mommy.
1,9,JENNY,"Oh my God! [She takes RITCHIE out of the refrigerator and holds him in her arms. A few moments later, there is a knock on the door. She answers it and sees SAM, DEAN, and MISSOURI.] Sam, Dean. What are you doing here?"
1,9,SAM,"Hey, Jenny. This is our friend, Missouri."
1,9,DEAN,"If it’s not too much trouble, we were hoping to show her the old house. You know, for old time’s sake."
1,9,JENNY,"You know, this isn’t a good time. I’m kind of busy."
1,9,DEAN,"Listen, Jenny, it’s important. [MISSOURI smacks him on the back of the head.] Ow!"
1,9,MISSOURI,"Give the poor girl a break, can’t you see she’s upset? [to JENNY] Forgive this boy, he means well, he’s just not the sharpest tool in the shed, but hear me out. [DEAN looks stunned.]"
1,9,JENNY,About what?
1,9,MISSOURI,About this house.
1,9,JENNY,What are you talking about?
1,9,MISSOURI,"I think you know what I’m talking about. You think there’s something in this house, something that wants to hurt your family. Am I mistaken?"
1,9,JENNY,Who are you?
1,9,MISSOURI,"We’re people who can help, who can stop this thing. But you’re gonna have to trust us, just a little. [JENNY looks unsure.]"
1,9,MISSOURI,"If there’s a dark energy around here, this room should be the center of it."
1,9,SAM,Why?
1,9,MISSOURI,"This used to be your nursery, Sam. This is where it all happened. [SAM glances at the ceiling. While MISSOURI looks around the room, DEAN pulls out his EMF meter.] That an EMF?"
1,9,DEAN,Yeah.
1,9,MISSOURI,"Amateur. [DEAN glares at her. He nudges SAM and shows him that the EMF is beeping frantically.] I don’t know if you boys should be disappointed or relieved, but this ain’t the thing that took your mom."
1,9,SAM,"Wait, are you sure? [She nods.] How do you know?"
1,9,MISSOURI,It isn’t the same energy I felt the last time I was here. It’s somethin’ different.
1,9,DEAN,What is it?
1,9,DEAN,What are they doing here?
1,9,MISSOURI,"They’re here because of what happened to your family. You see, all those years ago, real evil came to you. It walked this house. That kind of evil leaves wounds. And sometimes, wounds get infected."
1,9,SAM,I don’t understand.
1,9,MISSOURI,This place is a magnet for paranormal energy. It’s attracted a poltergeist. A nasty one. And it won’t rest until Jenny and her babies are dead.
1,9,SAM,You said there was more than one spirit.
1,9,MISSOURI,There is. I just can’t quite make out the second one.
1,9,DEAN,"Well, one thing’s for damn sure –- nobody’s dyin’ in this house ever again. So whatever is here, how do we stop it?"
1,9,[CUT TO,"MISSOURI’S HOUSE. DEAN, SAM, and MISSOURI are sitting around a table. On the table are different herbs and roots.]"
1,9,DEAN,"So, what is all this stuff, anyway?"
1,9,MISSOURI,"Angelica Root, Van Van oil, crossroad dirt, a few other odds and ends."
1,9,DEAN,Yeah? What are we supposed to do with it?
1,9,MISSOURI,"We’re gonna put them inside the walls in the north, south, east, west corners on each floor of the house."
1,9,DEAN,We’ll be punchin’ holes in the dry wall. Jenny’s gonna love that.
1,9,MISSOURI,[slyly] She’ll live.
1,9,SAM,And this’ll destroy the spirits?
1,9,MISSOURI,"It should. It should purify the house completely. We’ll each take a floor. But we work fast. Once the spirits realize what we’re up to, things are gonna get bad."
1,9,[CUT TO,EXT. – WINCHESTER HOUSE. MISSOURI is walking JENNY and her kids outside.]
1,9,JENNY,"Look, I’m not sure I’m comfortable leaving you guys here alone."
1,9,MISSOURI,"Just take your kids to the movies or somethin’, and it’ll be over by the time you get back. [JENNY, still slightly unsure, leaves with her kids. MISSOURI goes back inside.]"
1,9,DEAN,Sam!
1,9,[FADE IN,"INT. – WINCHESTER HOUSE. A few hours later, DEAN, SAM, and MISSOURI are standing in the extremely messy kitchen.]"
1,9,SAM,You sure this is over?
1,9,MISSOURI,I’m sure. Why? Why do you ask?
1,9,SAM,"Never mind. [He sighs.] It’s nothin’, I guess. [They hear JENNY enter the house.]"
1,9,JENNY,Hello? We’re home. [She comes into the kitchen and looks around.] What happened?
1,9,SAM,"Hi, sorry. Um, we’ll pay for all of this. [DEAN looks confused.]"
1,9,MISSOURI,"Don’t you worry. Dean’s gonna clean up this mess. [DEAN stands there, not moving.] Well, what are you waiting for, boy? Get the mop. [He begins walking away.] And don’t cuss at me! [DEAN walks away, muttering under his breath. A little while later, MISSOURI and the boys leave the house. JENNY waves and shuts the door behind them.]"
1,9,DEAN,"All right, so, tell me again, what are we still doin’ here?"
1,9,SAM,I don’t know. I just…I still have a bad feeling.
1,9,DEAN,"Why? Missouri did her whole Zelda Rubenstein thing, the house should be clean, it should be over."
1,9,SAM,"Yeah, well, probably. But I just wanna make sure, that’s all."
1,9,DEAN,"Yeah, well, problem is I could be sleeping in a bed right now. [He slides down in his seat and closes his eyes. SAM looks up at JENNY’S bedroom window and sees her screaming, just as in his dream.]"
1,9,SAM,"Dean. Look, Dean! [They rush out of the car and run towards the house.]"
1,9,DEAN,"You grab the kids, I’ll get Jenny."
1,9,DEAN,Jenny!
1,9,JENNY,I can’t open the door!
1,9,DEAN,Stand back! [She moves back. DEAN kicks down the door and brings her downstairs.]
1,9,JENNY,"No, my kids!"
1,9,DEAN,"Sam’s got your kids, come on."
1,9,SAM,"Don’t look. Don’t look! [They leave the bedroom. Outside, DEAN and JENNY rush out of the house. Inside the house, SAM rushes down the stairs and puts the kids down on the floor.] All right, Sari, take your brother outside as fast as you can, and don’t look back. [Suddenly, an invisible force makes SAM fall to the floor. He slides backwards into another room, crashing into a table. SARI screams and runs outside with RITCHIE. They rush outside to DEAN and JENNY. DEAN kneels down to SARI’S eye level.]"
1,9,DEAN,"Sari, where’s Sam?"
1,9,SARI,"[crying] He’s inside. Something’s got him. [Panicked, DEAN looks at the front door. It slams shut on its own, and the screen goes black.]"
1,9,[FADE IN,"EXT – WINCHESTER HOUSE. DEAN opens the trunk of the Impala and grabs a rifle and an ax. He rushes to the front door and begins chopping away at it. Inside the kitchen, SAM gets flung into a set of cabinets. He stands up and is pinned against the wall by the invisible force. He can’t move any part of his body. The fire figure makes its way towards SAM. DEAN continues chopping down parts of the door. Eventually, he makes a hole that he is able to step through. He walks through the house, looking for SAM.]"
1,9,DEAN,"Sam? Sam! [He finds SAM. As he looks at the fire figure, he raises his gun.]"
1,9,SAM,"No, don’t! Don’t!"
1,9,DEAN,"What, why?!"
1,9,SAM,Because I know who it is. I can see her now.
1,9,DEAN,[softly] Mom? [MARY smiles and steps closer to him.]
1,9,MARY,"Dean. [Tears form in DEAN’S eyes. MARY walks away from him and goes to SAM. DEAN watches her, never taking his eyes off her.] Sam. [SAM smiles weakly, crying. His mother’s smile fades.] I’m sorry."
1,9,SAM,"For what? [She looks at him sadly, but says nothing. She walks away from them and looks up at the ceiling.]"
1,9,MARY,"You get out of my house. And let go of my son. [Once again, she bursts into flames. When she is entirely engulfed, the fire reaches the ceiling and disappears. The force holding SAM to the wall is released. He walks over to DEAN, and the two of them look at each other, stunned.]"
1,9,SAM,Now it’s over.
1,9,DEAN,Thanks for these.
1,9,JENNY,"Don’t thank me, they’re yours. [DEAN puts the trunk of photos into the car. Sitting on the front steps of the house, SAM is joined by MISSOURI.]"
1,9,MISSOURI,"Well, there are no spirits in there anymore, this time for sure."
1,9,SAM,Not even my mom?
1,9,MISSOURI,No.
1,9,SAM,What happened?
1,9,MISSOURI,"Your mom’s spirit and the poltergeist’s energy, they cancelled each other out. Your mom destroyed herself goin’ after the thing."
1,9,SAM,Why would she do something like that?
1,9,MISSOURI,"Well, to protect her boys, of course. [SAM nods, with tears in his eyes. MISSOURI goes to put her hand on his shoulder, but she stops herself.] Sam, I’m sorry."
1,9,SAM,For what?
1,9,MISSOURI,"You sensed it was here, didn’t you? Even when I couldn’t."
1,9,SAM,What’s happening to me?
1,9,MISSOURI,"I know I should have all the answers, but I don’t know."
1,9,DEAN,"Sam, you ready? [SAM nods and goes to the car. JENNY thanks all of them.]"
1,9,MISSOURI,Don’t you boys be strangers.
1,9,DEAN,We won’t.
1,9,MISSOURI,"See you around. [JENNY waves. They smile, get in the car, and drive away.]"
1,9,[CUT TO,INT. – MISSOURI’S HOUSE. MISSOURI comes inside and sets her purse on the table.]
1,9,MISSOURI,"That boy…he has such powerful abilities. But why he couldn’t sense his own father, I have no idea. [The camera pans over to her couch, where JOHN WINCHESTER is sitting.]"
1,9,JOHN,Mary’s spirit –- do you really think she saved the boys?
1,9,MISSOURI,"I do. [JOHN nods sadly and twists his wedding ring on his finger.] John Winchester, I could just slap you. Why won’t you go talk to your children?"
1,9,JOHN,[tearfully] I want to. You have no idea how much I wanna see ‘em. But I can’t. Not yet. Not until I know the truth. [They share a look. The screen fades to black.]

1,11,FADE IN,"Burkittsville, Indiana – One Year Ago. A married couple, HOLLY and VINCE PARKER are leaving a café, which is next to a gas station. With them is an older couple, HARLEY and STACY JORGESON, and their teenage niece, EMILY.)"
1,11,STACY,"And before you leave, one of our apple pies. (She hands HOLLY a box). On the house."
1,11,HOLLY,"Oh, my God, thank you so much!"
1,11,STACY,You’re welcome.
1,11,HOLLY,"(to VINCE) Hey, we should get lost more often. I mean, everyone in this town is so nice."
1,11,VINCE,"Yeah, what’s the catch?"
1,11,HARLEY,(after filling the couple’s car with gas) You’re all set.
1,11,VINCE,Thanks. (They shake hands. EMILY notices an intricate tattoo on VINCE’s arm.)
1,11,EMILY,That’s a cool tattoo.
1,11,VINCE,Thanks.
1,11,HARLEY,"So, let’s get you back to the interstate."
1,11,VINCE,"Yeah, please."
1,11,HARLEY,Take Laskey straight out of town.
1,11,STACY,And then you’re gonna turn right on Orchard Road.
1,11,VINCE,Ok. Thank you. (They wave goodbye and the couple drives away.)
1,11,(CUT TO,The town orchard. The couple’s car breaks down.)
1,11,HOLLY,What happened?
1,11,VINCE,"I don’t know. Car just died. (He takes his cell phone out of his pocket.) Cell phone, too."
1,11,HOLLY,How is that possible? (They get out of the car and look around the orchard.)
1,11,VINCE,"Come on, looks like a house over there. (He starts walking away.)"
1,11,HOLLY,"No, I’m not going down there."
1,11,VINCE,"Holly, we need help, we can’t just wait here."
1,11,HOLLY,(very reluctantly) Ok. (She follows VINCE.)
1,11,(CUT TO,Another part of the orchard. HOLLY and VINCE stop by a scarecrow raised on a wooden post. They exchange a look and walk closer to it.)
1,11,VINCE,Check it out. If I only had a brain…
1,11,HOLLY,We wouldn’t be lost.
1,11,VINCE,Thanks. That has got to be the freakiest damn scarecrow I’ve ever seen.
1,11,HOLLY,"It scares me. (They start walking away, but HOLLY sees the scarecrow’s head move. She gasps.) Please, let’s just hurry, okay? (They start walking away. A few seconds later, they hear a rustling in the trees and turn around. No one is there.)"
1,11,VINCE,"Did you hear that? (HOLLY nods.) Hello? Who’s there? (Nobody responds. They start running through the orchard. A minute later, HOLLY turns to VINCE, and he is gone. She stops.)"
1,11,HOLLY,Vince? Vince? (She starts running in the opposite direction to try and find VINCE. She trips and falls on the ground. She turns her head and sees VINCE’s mutilated body on the ground. She screams and sees the scarecrow towering over her. She continues to scream while the camera pans to the scarecrow’s now empty post.)
1,11,(CUT TO,INT. – motel. SAM and DEAN are sleeping. DEAN’s phone rings but he does not wake up.)
1,11,SAM,Dean. (DEAN still doesn’t wake up. SAM answers the phone.) Hello?
1,11,(CUT TO,A payphone in California. The scene alternates between the payphone and the motel bedroom.)
1,11,JOHN,"Sam, is that you? (SAM sits up in bed.)"
1,11,SAM,Dad? Are you hurt?
1,11,JOHN,I’m fine.
1,11,SAM,"We’ve been looking for you everywhere. We didn’t know where you were, if you were okay."
1,11,JOHN,"Sammy, I’m all right. What about you and Dean? (At the motel, DEAN is waking up.)"
1,11,SAM,"We’re fine. Dad, where are you? (DEAN sits up in bed.)"
1,11,JOHN,"Sorry, kiddo, I can’t tell you that."
1,11,SAM,What? Why not?
1,11,DEAN,Is that Dad?
1,11,JOHN,"Look, I know this is hard for you to understand. You’re just gonna have to trust me on this."
1,11,SAM,"You’re after it, aren’t you? The thing that killed Mom."
1,11,JOHN,"Yeah. It’s a demon, Sam."
1,11,SAM,A demon? You know for sure?
1,11,DEAN,A demon? What’s he saying?
1,11,JOHN,"I do. Listen, Sammy, I, uh…I also know what happened to your girlfriend. I’m so sorry. I would’ve done anything to protect you from that."
1,11,SAM,You know where it is?
1,11,JOHN,"Yeah, I think I’m finally closing in on it."
1,11,SAM,Let us help.
1,11,JOHN,You can’t. You can’t be any part of it.
1,11,SAM,Why not?
1,11,DEAN,Give me the phone.
1,11,JOHN,"Listen, Sammy, that’s why I’m calling. You and your brother, you gotta stop looking for me. Alright, now, I need you to write down these names."
1,11,SAM,"Names? What names, Dad—talk to me, tell me what’s going on."
1,11,JOHN,"Look, we don’t have time for this. This is bigger than you think, they’re everywhere. Even us talking right now, it’s not safe."
1,11,SAM,No. Alright? No way.
1,11,DEAN,Give me the phone.
1,11,JOHN,"I have given you an order. Now, you stop following me, and you do your job. You understand me? Now, take down these names. (DEAN grabs the phone from SAM.)"
1,11,DEAN,"Dad, it’s me. Where are you? (…) Yes, sir. (…) Uh, yeah, I got a pen. What are their names?"
1,11,(CUT TO,INT.- DEAN’s car.)
1,11,SAM,"Alright, so, the names Dad gave us, they’re all couples?"
1,11,DEAN,Three different couples. All went missing.
1,11,SAM,And they’re all from different towns? Different states?
1,11,DEAN,"That’s right. You got Washington, New York, Colorado. Each couple took a road trip cross-country. None of them arrived at their destination, and none of them were ever heard from again."
1,11,SAM,"Well, it’s a big country, Dean. They could’ve disappeared anywhere."
1,11,DEAN,"Yeah, could’ve. But each one’s route took ‘em to the same part of Indiana. Always on the second week of April. One year after another after another."
1,11,SAM,This is the second week of April.
1,11,DEAN,Yep.
1,11,SAM,"So, Dad is sending us to Indiana to go hunting for something before another couple vanishes?"
1,11,DEAN,"Yahtzee. Can you imagine putting together a pattern like this? All the different obits Dad had to go through? The man’s a master. (SAM looks annoyed, pulls over to the side of the road and turns off the car.) What are you doing?"
1,11,SAM,We’re not going to Indiana.
1,11,DEAN,We’re not?
1,11,SAM,No. We’re going to California. Dad called from a payphone. Sacramento area code.
1,11,DEAN,Sam.
1,11,SAM,"Dean, if this demon killed Mom and Jess, and Dad’s closing in, we’ve gotta be there. We’ve gotta help."
1,11,DEAN,Dad doesn’t want our help.
1,11,SAM,I don’t care.
1,11,DEAN,He’s given us an order.
1,11,SAM,(firmly) I don’t care. We don’t always have to do what he says.
1,11,DEAN,"Sam, Dad is asking us to work jobs, to save lives, it’s important."
1,11,SAM,"Alright, I understand, believe me, I understand. But I’m talking one week here, man, to get answers. To get revenge."
1,11,DEAN,"Alright, look, I know how you feel."
1,11,SAM,Do you? (DEAN seems shocked at SAM’s tone.) How old were you when Mom died? Four? Jess died six months ago. How the hell would you know how I feel?
1,11,DEAN,"Dad said it wasn’t safe. For any of us. I mean, he obviously knows something that we don’t, so if he says to stay away, we stay away."
1,11,SAM,"I don’t understand the blind faith you have in the man. I mean, it’s like you don’t even question him."
1,11,DEAN,"Yeah, it’s called being a good son! (SAM, angry, gets out of the car. DEAN also gets out and watches SAM unloading things from the trunk.) You’re a selfish bastard, you know that? You just do whatever you want. Don’t care what anybody thinks."
1,11,SAM,That’s what you really think?
1,11,DEAN,"Yes, it is."
1,11,SAM,"Well, then this selfish bastard is going to California. (He puts on his backpack and starts walking away.)"
1,11,DEAN,"Come on, you’re not serious."
1,11,SAM,I am serious.
1,11,DEAN,"It’s the middle of the night! Hey, I’m taking off, I will leave your ass, you hear me? (SAM stops walking and turns around.)"
1,11,SAM,"That’s what I want you to do. (They stare at each other for a few seconds, waiting.)"
1,11,DEAN,"Goodbye, Sam. (He closes the trunk, gets in the car, and drives away. SAM watches him leave, then starts walking away.)"
1,11,(CUT TO,"Burkittsville, Indiana. DEAN pulls over to the side of the road and pulls out his cell phone. He selects the name “Sam Mobile” and thinks about calling SAM. He changes his mind and closes his cell phone, then shuts off the car and gets out.)"
1,11,(CUT TO,EXT.- Scotty’s Café. SCOTTY is sitting in a chair on the porch. DEAN walks up to him.)
1,11,DEAN,(gesturing to the sign) Let me guess. (points to SCOTTY) Scotty. (SCOTTY looks at the sign.)
1,11,SCOTTY,Yep.
1,11,DEAN,"Hi, my name’s John Bonham."
1,11,SCOTTY,Isn’t that the drummer for Led Zeppelin?
1,11,DEAN,(taken aback) Wow. Good. Classic rock fan.
1,11,SCOTTY,"What can I do for you, John? (DEAN takes two pieces of paper out of his pocket. They are Missing Person flyers for HOLLY and VINCE PARKER.)"
1,11,DEAN,"I was wondering if, uh, you’d seen these people by chance. (SCOTTY looks at the flyers.)"
1,11,SCOTTY,Nope. Who are they?
1,11,DEAN,"Friends of mine. They went missing about a year ago. They passed through somewhere around here, and I’ve already asked around Scottsburg and Salem—"
1,11,SCOTTY,Sorry. (He hands the flyers back to DEAN.) We don’t get many strangers around here. (DEAN nods.)
1,11,DEAN,"Scotty, you’ve got a smile that lights up a room, anybody ever tell you that? (SCOTTY stares at him strangely. DEAN chuckles.) Never mind. See you around. (He walks away.)"
1,11,(CUT TO,"Highway. SAM is standing on the side of the road. He turns around and sees a young girl with short blonde hair, MEG, sitting with her back to him. She is listening to music.)"
1,11,SAM,Hey. (She can’t hear him. He walks over to her and puts his hand on her shoulder. She jumps and takes off her headphones.)
1,11,MEG,You scared the hell outta me.
1,11,SAM,I’m sorry. I just thought you might need some help.
1,11,MEG,"No, I’m good, thanks."
1,11,SAM,"Uh, so where you headed?"
1,11,MEG,"No offense, but no way I’m telling you."
1,11,SAM,Why not?
1,11,MEG,"You could be some kind of freak. I mean, you are hitchhiking."
1,11,SAM,"Well, so are you. (MEG laughs. A van honks its horn and pulls over.)"
1,11,VAN DRIVER,Need a ride?
1,11,VAN DRIVER,(to SAM) Just her. I ain’t takin’ you. (MEG gathers her things and gets in the van.)
1,11,SAM,(to MEG) You trust shady van guy and not me?
1,11,MEG,Definitely. (They drive away.)
1,11,(CUT TO,"INT. – Jorgeson General Store. Burkittsville, Indiana.)"
1,11,DEAN,You sure they didn’t stop for gas or something? (HARLEY shows the pictures to STACY. STACY shakes her head.)
1,11,HARLEY,"Nope, don’t remember ‘em. You said they were friends of yours?"
1,11,DEAN,That’s right. (EMILY comes downstairs carrying some boxes.)
1,11,EMILY,Did the guy have a tattoo?
1,11,DEAN,"Yes, he did. (EMILY puts the boxes on the counter and looks at the picture of VINCE.)"
1,11,EMILY,(to STACY and HARLEY) You remember? They were just married.
1,11,HARLEY,(suddenly remembering) You’re right. They did stop for gas. Weren’t here more than ten minutes.
1,11,DEAN,You remember anything else?
1,11,HARLEY,I told ‘em how to get back to the Interstate. They left town.
1,11,DEAN,Could you point me in that same direction?
1,11,HARLEY,Sure.
1,11,(CUT TO,"INT.- DEAN’s car. He is driving by the orchard when he hears a noise coming from the backseat.) What the hell? (He pulls over and reaches into his bag. He pulls out the EMF meter, which is beeping frantically.)"
1,11,(CUT TO,Orchard. DEAN is walking around and sees the scarecrow on its post. He walks over to it and looks at it for a second.)
1,11,DEAN,"Dude, you're fugly. (The scarecrow doesn’t move. DEAN notices a sickle in the scarecrow’s hand and a design on its arm. DEAN takes a ladder from a nearby tree and climbs to the top so that he is eye level with the scarecrow. He moves its clothing and recognizes the design from VINCE’s tattoo. He pulls out VINCE’s flyer and compares the designs, which are exactly the same. He looks at the scarecrow again.) Nice tat. (The screen goes black.)"
1,11,(FADE IN,Burkittsville gas station. DEAN pulls up in his car and gets out. EMILY is standing by the gas pumps.)
1,11,EMILY,You’re back.
1,11,DEAN,Never left.
1,11,EMILY,Still looking for your friends? (DEAN nods.)
1,11,DEAN,"(noticing EMILY’s nameplate necklace) You mind fillin’ her up there, Emily? (She grabs a pump and starts filling up DEAN’s tank.) So, you grew up here?"
1,11,EMILY,I came here when I was thirteen. I lost my parents. Car accident. My aunt and uncle took me in.
1,11,DEAN,They’re nice people.
1,11,EMILY,Everybody’s nice here.
1,11,DEAN,"So, what, it’s the, uh, perfect little town?"
1,11,EMILY,"Well, you know, it’s the boonies. But I love it. I mean, the towns around us, people are losing their homes, their farms. But here, it’s almost like we’re blessed. (DEAN nods.)"
1,11,DEAN,"Hey, you been out to the orchard? You seen that scarecrow?"
1,11,EMILY,"Yeah, it creeps me out. (DEAN laughs.)"
1,11,DEAN,Whose is it?
1,11,EMILY,I don’t know. It’s just always been there.
1,11,DEAN,(nodding towards a red van parked by the garage) That your aunt and uncle’s?
1,11,EMILY,Customer. Had some car troubles.
1,11,DEAN,"It’s not a couple, is it? A guy and a girl? (EMILY nods.)"
1,11,EMILY,Mmhmm. (DEAN looks concerned.)
1,11,(CUT TO,Bus Station. SAM is talking to the clerk.)
1,11,SAM,Tomorrow? There’s got to be another way.
1,11,CLERK,"Well, there is. Buy a car. (SAM, annoyed, leaves the ticket window. He takes out his PalmPilot and selects DEAN’s phone number.)"
1,11,MEG,"(sitting on the floor with her bags) Hey. (SAM looks at her, confused, and turns off his PalmPilot without calling DEAN.)"
1,11,SAM,Hey.
1,11,MEG,You again.
1,11,SAM,What happened to your ride?
1,11,MEG,"You were right. That guy was shady. He was all hands. (SAM raises his eyebrows.) I cut him loose. (SAM looks around, disappointed.) What’s the matter?"
1,11,SAM,Just trying to get to California.
1,11,MEG,(surprised) No way.
1,11,SAM,Yeah.
1,11,MEG,"Me too. (She stands up and walks toward SAM) You know, the next bus isn’t until tomorrow."
1,11,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, that’s the problem."
1,11,MEG,Why? What’s in Cali that’s so important?
1,11,SAM,Just something I’ve been looking for. For a long time.
1,11,MEG,"Well, then I’m sure it can wait one more day, right? (SAM laughs. MEG extends her hand and SAM shakes it.) I’m Meg."
1,11,SAM,Sam.
1,11,(CUT TO,INT. – Scotty’s Café. SCOTTY is serving the couple whose car broke down. He puts two plates of apple pie in front of them.)
1,11,SCOTTY,"We’re famous for our apples. So, you gotta try this pie."
1,11,GIRL,"Oh, no. It—please."
1,11,SCOTTY,It’s on the house. (DEAN walks in.)
1,11,DEAN,"Oh, hey, Scotty. Can I get a coffee, black? (SCOTTY walks away to get it.) Oh, and some of that pie, too, while you’re at it. (He sits at a table next to the couple.) How ya doin’? (The couple waves and smiles.) Just passing through?"
1,11,GIRL,Road trip.
1,11,DEAN,"Hm. Yeah, me too. (They nod. SCOTTY walks over to refill their cider.)"
1,11,SCOTTY,I’m sure these people want to eat in peace.
1,11,DEAN,"Just a little friendly conversation. (SCOTTY walks away.) Oh, and that coffee, too, man. Thanks. (SCOTTY looks agitated. DEAN keeps talking to the couple.) So, what brings you to town?"
1,11,GIRL,"We just stopped for gas. And, uh, the guy at the gas station saved our lives."
1,11,DEAN,Is that right?
1,11,MAN,"Yeah, one of our brake lines was leaking. We had no idea. He was fixing it for us."
1,11,DEAN,(concerned) Nice people.
1,11,MAN,Yeah.
1,11,DEAN,"So, how long till you’re up and runnin’?"
1,11,MAN,Sundown.
1,11,DEAN,"Really. (He thinks about it for a minute.) To fix a brake line? (The man nods.) I mean, you know, I know a thing or two about cars. I could probably have you up and running in about an hour. I wouldn’t charge you anything."
1,11,GIRL,"You know, thanks a lot, but I think we’d rather have a mechanic do it."
1,11,DEAN,"Sure. I know. (He pauses.) You know, it’s just that these roads. They’re not real safe at night. (The couple exchange a look.)"
1,11,GIRL,I’m sorry?
1,11,DEAN,"I know it sounds strange, but, uh—you might be in danger."
1,11,MAN,"(annoyed) Look, we’re trying to eat. Okay?"
1,11,DEAN,"Yeah. (He looks disappointed. The couple seems worried by DEAN.) You know, my brother could give you this puppy dog look, and you’d just buy right into it. (The bell above the café door jingles and someone walks in. SCOTTY comes out from a back room.)"
1,11,SCOTTY,"Thanks for coming, Sheriff. (DEAN looks nervous and frustrated. SCOTTY whispers something in the sheriff’s ear, and they both look at DEAN, who looks away. The sheriff walks over to him.)"
1,11,SHERIFF,"I’d like a word, please."
1,11,DEAN,Come on. I’m having a bad day already.
1,11,SHERIFF,You know what would make it worse? (DEAN nods slowly.)
1,11,(CUT TO,"Interstate. The sheriff’s car is following DEAN’s car to make sure DEAN leaves. When he is gone, the sheriff turns around and drives back to Burkittsville.)"
1,11,(CUT TO,Bus Station. SAM and MEG are sitting at a table with beers and different foods around them.)
1,11,SAM,"So, what, are you on some kind of vacation or something? (MEG laughs.)"
1,11,MEG,"Yeah, right. It’s all sipping Cristal poolside for me. (They laugh.) No. I had to get away from my family."
1,11,SAM,Why?
1,11,MEG,"I love my parents. And they wanted what’s best for me. They just didn’t care if I wanted it. I was supposed to be smart. But not smart enough to scare away a husband. (SAM smiles.) It’s just…because my family said so, I was supposed to sit there and do what I was told. So I just went on my own way instead. (SAM stares at her.) I’m sorry. The things you say to people you hardly know."
1,11,SAM,"No, no, it’s okay. I know how you feel. Remember that brother I mentioned before, that I was road-tripping with? (MEG nods.) It’s, uh, it’s kind of the same deal."
1,11,MEG,"And that’s why you’re not riding with him anymore? (SAM shakes his head. MEG raises her beer bottle.) Here’s to us. The food might be bad, and the beds might be hard. But at least we’re living our own lives. And nobody else’s. (SAM taps his bottle against hers and they both drink.)"
1,11,(CUT TO,Interstate. Night. DEAN is driving back to Burkittsville.)
1,11,(CUT TO,Orchard. The couple’s car has broken down and they are walking through the orchard.)
1,11,GIRL,I can’t believe it. We just got the car fixed.
1,11,MAN,This way. (They start walking towards a clearing. The scarecrow moves quickly behind them. The girl gasps and they turn around.)
1,11,GIRL,Steve? (They hear more noises.)
1,11,STEVE,"Who’s there? (They look around and the scarecrow comes out from behind the trees. It begins walking towards them, and they start running away. They are almost at the clearing when DEAN runs in front of them. They stop.)"
1,11,DEAN,"Get back to your car. (The couple looks behind them and sees the scarecrow getting closer.) Go! Go! (The couple runs away. DEAN cocks his gun and shoots the scarecrow, which stumbles but keeps walking. DEAN begins running, cocks his gun again, and shoots. Again, the scarecrow keeps going. DEAN tries one more time, but the scarecrow keeps moving. DEAN keeps running.) Go! Go! (Finally, DEAN and the couple reach the clearing. DEAN cocks his gun and looks around, but the scarecrow has disappeared.)"
1,11,STEVE,(panting) What—what the hell was that?
1,11,DEAN,Don’t ask. (The screen goes black.)
1,11,(FADE IN,"Bus Station. Middle of the night. MEG is sleeping on the floor. SAM is sitting by his bags, on the phone with DEAN. The scene alternates between the bus station and DEAN’s car.)"
1,11,SAM,The scarecrow climbed off its cross?
1,11,DEAN,"Yeah, I’m tellin’ ya. Burkittsville, Indiana. Fun Town."
1,11,SAM,"It didn’t kill the couple, did it?"
1,11,DEAN,"No. I can’t cope without you, you know."
1,11,SAM,"So, something must be animating it. A spirit."
1,11,DEAN,"No, it’s more than a spirit. It’s a god. A Pagan god, anyway."
1,11,SAM,What makes you say that?
1,11,DEAN,The annual cycle of its killings? And the fact that the victims are always a man and a woman. Like some kind of fertility right. And you should see the locals. The way they treated this couple. Fattenin’ ‘em up like a Christmas turkey.
1,11,SAM,The last meal. Given to sacrificial victims.
1,11,DEAN,"Yeah, I’m thinking a ritual sacrifice to appease some Pagan god."
1,11,SAM,"So, a god possesses the scarecrow..."
1,11,DEAN,"And the scarecrow takes its sacrifice. And for another year, the crops won’t wilt, and disease won’t spread."
1,11,SAM,Do you know which god you’re dealing with?
1,11,DEAN,"No, not yet."
1,11,SAM,"Well, you figure out what it is, you can figure out a way to kill it."
1,11,DEAN,"I know. I’m actually on my way to a local community college. I’ve got an appointment with a professor. You know, since I don’t have my trusty sidekick geek boy to do all the research. (SAM laughs.)"
1,11,SAM,"You know, if you’re hinting you need my help, just ask."
1,11,DEAN,"I’m not hinting anything. Actually, uh—I want you to know….I mean, don’t think…."
1,11,SAM,"Yeah. I’m sorry, too."
1,11,DEAN,Sam. You were right. You gotta do your own thing. You gotta live your own life.
1,11,SAM,Are you serious?
1,11,DEAN,"You’ve always known what you want. And you go after it. You stand up to Dad. And you always have. Hell, I wish I—anyway….I admire that about you. I’m proud of you, Sammy."
1,11,SAM,I don’t even know what to say.
1,11,DEAN,Say you’ll take care of yourself.
1,11,SAM,I will.
1,11,DEAN,Call me when you find Dad.
1,11,SAM,"(sadly) OK. Bye, Dean. (They hang up. MEG wakes up and moves next to SAM.)"
1,11,MEG,Who was that?
1,11,SAM,My brother.
1,11,MEG,What’d he say?
1,11,SAM,Goodbye. (They exchange a look.)
1,11,(CUT TO,Community College. Day. DEAN is with the college professor.)
1,11,PROFESSOR,It’s not every day I get a research question on Pagan ideology.
1,11,DEAN,"Yeah, well, call it a hobby."
1,11,PROFESSOR,But you said you were interested in local lore?
1,11,DEAN,Mmhmm.
1,11,PROFESSOR,I’m afraid Indiana isn’t really known for its Pagan worship.
1,11,DEAN,"Well, what if it was imported? You know, like the Pilgrims brought their religion over. Wasn’t a lot of this area settled by immigrants?"
1,11,PROFESSOR,"Well, yeah."
1,11,DEAN,"Like that town near here, Burkittsville. Where are their ancestors from?"
1,11,PROFESSOR,"Uh, northern Europe, I believe, Scandinavia."
1,11,DEAN,What could you tell me about those Pagan gods?
1,11,PROFESSOR,"Well, there are hundreds of Norse gods and goddesses."
1,11,DEAN,I’m actually looking for one. Might live in an orchard.
1,11,(CUT TO,College classroom. The professor puts a large book down on a table and opens it.)
1,11,PROFESSOR,"Woods god, hm? Well, let’s see. (He leafs through some pages. On one page, DEAN notices a picture of a scarecrow on a post surrounded by farmers in a field.)"
1,11,DEAN,"Wait, wait, wait. What’s that one?"
1,11,PROFESSOR,"Oh, that’s not a woods god, per se."
1,11,DEAN,"(reading) The V-Vanir? (The professor nods.) The Vanir were Norse gods of protection and prosperity, keeping the local settlements safe from harm. Some villages built effigies of the Vanir in their fields. Other villages practiced human sacrifice. One male, and one female. (points to the picture) Kind of looks like a scarecrow, huh?"
1,11,PROFESSOR,I suppose.
1,11,DEAN,(reading) This particular Vanir that’s energy sprung from the sacred tree?
1,11,PROFESSOR,"Well, Pagans believed all sorts of things were infused with magic."
1,11,DEAN,So what would happen if the sacred tree was torched? You think it’d kill the god?
1,11,PROFESSOR,"(laughing) Son, these are just legends we’re discussing."
1,11,DEAN,"Oh, of course. Yeah, you’re right. Listen, thank you very much. (He shakes the professor’s hand.)"
1,11,PROFESSOR,"Glad I could help. (DEAN walks to the classroom door. When he opens it, the sheriff hits him on the head with the end of his rifle. DEAN falls to the ground, and the sheriff and the professor exchange a knowing look.)"
1,11,(CUT TO,"Streets of Burkittsville. STACY, HARLEY, SCOTTY, and the sheriff are standing in the rain, upset.)"
1,11,SCOTTY,"You don’t understand, Harley. All of us here—It’s our responsibility to protect the town."
1,11,HARLEY,I understand. Better than all of you. I’m the one that gives ‘em directions. I’m the one that sends ‘em down to the orchard.
1,11,SHERIFF,"Harley, please."
1,11,HARLEY,"We all close our doors. Look the other way. Pretend we can’t hear the screams. But this is different, this—this is murder."
1,11,STACY,It’s angry with us. Already the trees are beginning to die. Tonight’s the seventh night of the cycle. Our last chance.
1,11,HARLEY,"If the boy has to die, the boy has to die. But why does it have to be her? (They say nothing, but stare at the ground, disappointed. The camera pans away from them.)"
1,11,(CUT TO,"Cellar. DEAN is by himself. Suddenly, the cellar door opens and EMILY is there, being held by her aunt and uncle. She is crying.)"
1,11,EMILY,"Aunt Stacy. Uncle Harley, please. (They bring her down the stairs, next to DEAN and go back upstairs.) Why are you doing this?"
1,11,STACY,For the common good. (She shuts the cellar door and DEAN and EMILY are left in the dark. The screen goes black.)
1,11,(FADE IN,Bus station. MEG is gathering her things. SAM is trying to call DEAN on his cell phone.)
1,11,MEG,"Hey. Our bus came in. (SAM hangs up the phone, shaking his head.)"
1,11,SAM,You better catch it. I gotta go. (He puts on his backpack.)
1,11,MEG,Go where?
1,11,SAM,Burkittsville.
1,11,MEG,"Sam, wait."
1,11,SAM,I’ve been trying to call my brother for the last three hours. I’m just getting his voicemail.
1,11,MEG,"Well, maybe his phone’s turned off."
1,11,SAM,"No, that’s not like him. Meg, I think he might be in trouble."
1,11,MEG,What kind of trouble?
1,11,SAM,"I can’t really explain right now. I’m sorry, look, I don’t want you to miss your bus."
1,11,MEG,"But I don’t understand. You’re running back to your brother? The guy you ran away from? Why, because he won’t pick up his phone? Sam—come with me to California."
1,11,SAM,I can’t. I’m sorry.
1,11,MEG,Why not?
1,11,SAM,"He’s my family. (SAM leaves. MEG watches him go, close to tears.)"
1,11,(CUT TO,"Cellar. DEAN is trying to open the cellar door, but he fails.)"
1,11,EMILY,I don’t understand. They’re gonna kill us?
1,11,DEAN,"Sacrifice us. Which is, I don’t know, classier, I guess? (He walks over to her.) You really didn’t know anything about this, did you?"
1,11,EMILY,About what? The scarecrow god? I can’t believe this.
1,11,DEAN,"Well, you better start believing, cause I’m gonna need your help."
1,11,EMILY,Okay.
1,11,DEAN,"Now, we can destroy the scarecrow, but we gotta find the tree."
1,11,EMILY,What tree?
1,11,DEAN,"Maybe you can help me with that. It would be really old. The locals would treat it with a lot of respect, you know, like it was sacred."
1,11,EMILY,There was this one apple tree. The immigrants brought it over with them. They call it the First Tree.
1,11,DEAN,Is it in the orchard?
1,11,EMILY,"Yeah, but I don’t know where. (The cellar door opens and the four elders are standing there.)"
1,11,STACY,"It’s time. (DEAN and EMILY look at each other, nervous.)"
1,11,(CUT TO,Orchard. The elders are tying DEAN and EMILY to two adjacent trees.)
1,11,DEAN,"How many people have you killed, Sheriff? How much blood is on your hands?"
1,11,SHERIFF,We don’t kill them.
1,11,DEAN,"No, but you sure cover up after. I mean, how many cars have you hidden, clothes have you buried? (The sheriff walks away.)"
1,11,EMILY,"Uncle Harley, please."
1,11,HARLEY,"I am so sorry, Em. I wish it wasn’t you."
1,11,STACY,Try to understand. It’s our responsibility. And there’s just no other choice. There’s nobody else but you.
1,11,EMILY,I’m your family.
1,11,STACY,"Sweetheart, that’s what sacrifice means. Giving up something you love for the greater good. The town needs to be safe. The good of the many outweighs the good of the one. (The four elders walk away.)"
1,11,DEAN,I hope your apple pie is freakin’ worth it!
1,11,EMILY,"So, what’s the plan?"
1,11,DEAN,I’m workin’ on it.
1,11,(FADE TO,Orchard. Hours later.)
1,11,EMILY,"You don’t have a plan, do you?"
1,11,DEAN,(slightly panicked) I’m workin’ on it. Can you see?
1,11,EMILY,What?
1,11,DEAN,Is he moving yet?
1,11,EMILY,"I can’t see. (A shadow is seen moving near the trees.) Oh my God. (As it moves closer, DEAN tries to untie his ropes.) Oh my God! (SAM comes out from behind the trees.)"
1,11,SAM,Dean?
1,11,DEAN,"(overjoyed) Oh! Oh, I take everything back I said. I’m so happy to see you. Come on. (SAM begins untying DEAN from the tree.) How’d you get here?"
1,11,SAM,"I, uh—I stole a car."
1,11,DEAN,Haha! That’s my boy! And keep an eye on that scarecrow. He could come alive any minute.
1,11,SAM,What scarecrow? (DEAN gets up and sees the scarecrow’s post is empty. He and SAM exchange a nervous look. The screen goes black.)
1,11,(FADE IN,"Orchard. SAM, DEAN, and EMILY are running.)"
1,11,SAM,"Alright, now, this sacred tree you’re talking about—"
1,11,DEAN,It’s the source of its power.
1,11,SAM,So let’s find it and burn it.
1,11,DEAN,"Nah, in the morning. Let’s just shag ass before Leather Face catches up. (The three of them reach a clearing. Waiting for them are the elders and a few other townspeople.) This way. (They turn around but they are blocked in all directions.)"
1,11,EMILY,Please. Let us go.
1,11,HARLEY,"It’ll be over quickly, I promise."
1,11,EMILY,Please.
1,11,HARLEY,"Emily, you have to let him take you. You have to—(All of a sudden, the scarecrow sticks his sickle through HARLEY’s stomach. EMILY and STACY scream, then STACY is captured by the scarecrow, too. EMILY runs into DEAN’s arms while he her aunt and uncle are dragged away by the scarecrow. The rest of the townspeople run away in fright.)"
1,11,DEAN,"Come on, let’s go. (SAM, DEAN, and EMILY start running. They hear a noise and turn around, but the scarecrow and its victims have disappeared. The three of them stay there and look around.)"
1,11,(FADE TO,"Orchard. Morning. SAM, DEAN, and EMILY walk to the sacred tree with gasoline and a lighter. The tree is marked with VINCE’s tattoo design. SAM goes to the tree and pours the gasoline on it. DEAN picks up a long branch and lights it.)"
1,11,EMILY,Let me. (She takes the branch from DEAN.)
1,11,DEAN,"You know, the whole town’s gonna die."
1,11,EMILY,"Good. (She throws the burning branch onto the tree, and the three of them watch it go up in flames.)"
1,11,(FADE TO,"Bus Stop. EMILY is getting on a bus to Boston. She smiles at DEAN, who waves to her. She waves back and takes a seat. DEAN and SAM watch the bus leave.)"
1,11,SAM,Think she’s gonna be alright?
1,11,DEAN,I hope so.
1,11,SAM,"And the rest of the townspeople, they’ll just get away with it?"
1,11,DEAN,"Well, what’ll happen to the town will have to be punishment enough. (They start walking to DEAN’s car.) So, can I drop you off somewhere?"
1,11,SAM,"No, I think you’re stuck with me. (They stop at the car.)"
1,11,DEAN,What made you change your mind?
1,11,SAM,"I didn’t. I still wanna find Dad. And you’re still a pain in the ass. (DEAN nods.) But, Jess and Mom—they’re both gone. Dad is God knows where. You and me. We’re all that’s left. So, if we’re gonna see this through, we’re gonna do it together. (DEAN pauses.)"
1,11,DEAN,"Hold me, Sam. That was beautiful. (He puts his hand on SAM’s shoulder, who hits it away. They laugh.)"
1,11,SAM,"You should be kissing my ass, you were dead meat, dude."
1,11,DEAN,"Yeah, right. I had a plan, I’d have gotten out."
1,11,SAM,Right. (They smile and get in the car.)
1,11,(CUT TO,Highway. Another shady guy is giving MEG a ride.)
1,11,VAN DRIVER,"So, where to, pretty lady?"
1,11,MEG,How about you pull over?
1,11,VAN DRIVER,(looks at her) Okay. That works. (He pulls over. MEG reaches into her bag and pulls out a silver bowl.) What’s that?
1,11,MEG,I’ve got to make a call. (She reaches into the bowl to get something.)
1,11,VAN DRIVER,I’ve got a cell phone you could use.
1,11,MEG,"It’s not that kind of call. (She pulls out a knife and slits the van driver’s throat. She holds the bowl under his neck and lets his blood pour into it.) Thanks for the ride. (She begins stirring the blood in the bowl with her finger.) Tire quiero patem me a di. (The blood swirls around and a silver orb appears in the middle of the liquid.) It makes no sense. I could’ve stopped Sam. Hell, I could’ve taken them both. Why let them go? (She pauses, seemingly listening to someone the audience cannot hear.) Yes. (She pauses again.) Yes. (She pauses one more time.) Yes, Father. (The screen fades to black.)"
1,12,SAM,"(looking upset) Dean, the guy probably would've died anyway. And someone else would've been healed."
1,12,SAM,(into phone) Dean it didn't work.The reaper's still coming!
1,15,(FADE TO,Living Room. Day. DEAN and SAM are dressed as sheriffs. They are talking to the boy and his mother.)
1,15,MRS. MCKAY,"I know you’re just doing your job, but the police have been here all week already. I don’t see why we have to go through this again. The more he tells the story, the more he believes it’s true."
1,15,SAM,"Mrs. McKay, we know you spoke with the local authorities."
1,15,DEAN,"But, uh, this seems like a matter for the state police, so…."
1,15,SAM,"Don’t worry about how crazy it sounds, Evan. You just tell us what you saw."
1,15,EVAN,"I was up late, watching TV. When I heard this weird noise."
1,15,SAM,What did it sound like?
1,15,EVAN,It sounded like….a monster. (DEAN and SAM exchange a look.)
1,15,MRS. MCKAY,Tell the officers what you were watching on TV.
1,15,EVAN,Godzilla Vs. Mothra. (DEAN smiles.)
1,15,DEAN,"(excitedly) That’s my favorite Godzilla movie. It’s so much better than the original, huh?"
1,15,EVAN,Totally.
1,15,DEAN,Yeah. (He nods towards SAM.) He likes the remake.
1,15,EVAN,Yuck! (SAM glares at DEAN and clears his throat. DEAN stops.)
1,15,SAM,"Evan, did you see what this thing was?"
1,15,EVAN,No. But I saw it grab Mr. Jenkins. It pulled him underneath the car.
1,15,SAM,Then what?
1,15,EVAN,It took him away. I heard the monster leaving. It made this really scary sound.
1,15,SAM,"What did it sound like, Evan?"
1,15,EVAN,Like this…whining growl. (SAM and DEAN exchange another look.)
1,15,SAM,Thanks for your time.
1,15,(CUT TO,"INT. – Kugel’s Keg. Night. SAM is having a beer at a table, looking at research. DEAN is nearby, throwing darts.)"
1,15,SAM,"So, local police have now ruled out foul play. Apparently, there are worse signs of a struggle."
1,15,DEAN,"Well, they could be right, it could just be a kidnapping. Maybe this isn’t our kind of gig."
1,15,SAM,"Yeah, maybe not. Except for this—Dad marked the area, Dean. (DEAN comes to the table and looks at their father’s journal.) Possible hunting grounds of a phantom attacker."
1,15,DEAN,Why would he even do that?
1,15,SAM,"Well, he found a lot of local folklore about a dark figure that comes out at night. Grabs people, then vanishes. He found this too—this county has more missing persons per capita than anywhere else in the state."
1,15,DEAN,That is weird.
1,15,SAM,Yeah.
1,15,DEAN,Don’t phantom attackers usually snatch people from their beds? Jenkins was taken from a parking lot.
1,15,SAM,"Well, there are all kinds. You know, Spring Heeled Jacks, phantom gassers. They take people anywhere, anytime. Look, Dean, I don’t know if this is our kind of gig either."
1,15,DEAN,"Yeah, you’re right, we should ask around more tomorrow."
1,15,SAM,Right. (He takes out his wallet.) I saw a motel about five miles back.
1,15,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, easy. Let’s have another round."
1,15,SAM,We should get an early start.
1,15,DEAN,"Yeah, you really know how to have fun, don’t you, Grandma? (SAM smiles.) Alright, I’ll meet you outside, I gotta take a leak. (He grabs his coat and heads to the bathroom. SAM gathers his research and leaves.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,"EXT. – Kugel’s Keg. SAM is walking back to the car. He hears a noise and stops. He places the journal on the hood of the car and takes out a flashlight from his coat pocket. He turns it on and looks around, then bends down to look under the car. He sees a cat, which hisses at him then runs away.)"
1,15,SAM,"Whoa! (He sees the animal and laughs at himself. He gets up, shaking his head, then waits by the car. The camera gives a view from under the car and focuses on SAM’s feet.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,"Minutes later. DEAN comes out of the bar and walks to the car. He sees that SAM is missing, but notices the journal on the hood. DEAN opens the car door and checks to see if SAM is inside, but he isn’t there. He looks around, confused.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,"Later. A group of people come out of the bar. DEAN walks up to a biker and his girlfriend, who are clearly drunk.)"
1,15,DEAN,"Hey, you guys been outside, around here in the last hour or so? (They shake their head and walk away.) Sam! (He looks around frantically.) Sammy! (He turns around and notices a surveillance camera on top of a streetlight. DEAN walks into the middle of the deserted road and looks around.) Sam. (The screen goes black.)"
1,15,(FADE IN,"Sheriff’s Department. A deputy, KATHLEEN, is looking at DEAN’s fake ID.)"
1,15,KATHLEEN,"So, what can we do for you, Officer Washington?"
1,15,DEAN,I’m working a missing persons.
1,15,KATHLEEN,I didn’t know the Jenkins case was being covered by the state police.
1,15,DEAN,"Oh, no. No, there’s someone else. Actually, it’s my cousin. We were havin’ a few last night at this bar down by the highway. And I haven’t seen him since."
1,15,KATHLEEN,Does your cousin have a drinking problem?
1,15,DEAN,"Sam? Two beers and he’s doin’ karaoke. (KATHLEEN smiles.) No, he wasn’t drunk. He was taken. (KATHLEEN nods and sits down at her computer. DEAN follows her and sits also.)"
1,15,KATHLEEN,Alright. What’s his name?
1,15,DEAN,Winchester. Sam Winchester.
1,15,KATHLEEN,Like the rifle?
1,15,DEAN,"Like the rifle. (KATHLEEN types SAM’s name in the computer and brings up his police record. She observes the page, then clicks on DEAN’s link and brings up his record.)"
1,15,KATHLEEN,"Samuel Winchester. So, you know that his brother, Dean Winchester, died in St. Louis. And, uh, was suspected of murder. (DEAN tries to look nonchalant.)"
1,15,DEAN,"Yeah, Dean. Kind of the black sheep of the family. Handsome, though."
1,15,KATHLEEN,"Uh-huh. (She types something else and brings up more search results on the computer.) Well, he’s not showing up in any current field reports."
1,15,DEAN,"Oh, I already have a lead. I saw a surveillance camera by the highway."
1,15,KATHLEEN,Uh-huh. The county traffic cam?
1,15,DEAN,"Right. Yeah. I’m thinking the camera picked up whatever took him. Or, whoever."
1,15,KATHLEEN,"Well, I have access to the traffic cam footage down at the county works department, but—well, anyhow, let’s do this the right way. (She stands up and gets some paperwork from a filing cabinet.) Why don’t you fill out a missing persons report and sit tight over here? (She hands him a clipboard.)"
1,15,DEAN,"Officer, look, uh, he’s family. I kind of—I kind of look out for the kid. You gotta let me go with you."
1,15,KATHLEEN,"I’m sorry, I can’t do that."
1,15,DEAN,"Well, tell me something. Your county has its fair share of missing persons. Any of ‘em come back? (KATHLEEN looks sad.) Sam’s my responsibility. And he’s comin’ back. I’m bringin’ him back. (She stares at him.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,Unknown location. SAM is asleep in a cage. He jerks awake and observes his surroundings. He rattles the bars of the cage. He looks around and notices JENKINS asleep in a cage next to his.)
1,15,(CUT TO,"EXT. – County Works Department. DEAN is sitting on a bench outside. KATHLEEN comes behind him, holding printouts of the camera footage.)"
1,15,KATHLEEN,"Greg. (He sees her and stands up.) I think we’ve got something. (She hands him the printouts and he looks through them.) These traffic cams take an image every three seconds, as part of the Amber Alert program. These images were all taken around the time that your cousin, Sam, disappeared."
1,15,DEAN,This really isn’t what I’m looking for.
1,15,KATHLEEN,"Just wait, wait—next one. (He turns the page and sees an image of a rusty truck driving.) This one was taken right after Sam left the bar. Look at the back end of that thing. Now, look at the plates. (DEAN turns another page and sees a close-up image of the truck’s license plates.)"
1,15,DEAN,"Oh, the plates look new. It’s probably stolen."
1,15,KATHLEEN,"So, whoever’s driving that rust bucket must be involved. (A beat-up van drives by. Its engine is whining loudly.)"
1,15,DEAN,Hear that engine?
1,15,KATHLEEN,Yeah.
1,15,DEAN,"Kind of a whining growl, isn’t it?"
1,15,KATHLEEN,Sure. (DEAN stares at the van as it drives away.)
1,15,DEAN,(to himself) I’ll be damned.
1,15,(CUT TO,"Unknown location. SAM is trying to kick down the door of his cage, but he fails. JENKINS groans and wakes up. SAM rushes over to talk to him through the bars of their cages.)"
1,15,SAM,"You’re alive. (JENKINS groans again.) Hey, you okay?"
1,15,JENKINS,Does it look like I’m doin’ okay?
1,15,SAM,Where are we?
1,15,JENKINS,"I don’t know. The country, I think. Smells like the country."
1,15,SAM,"You’re Alvin Jenkins, aren’t you?"
1,15,JENKINS,Yeah. (SAM sighs.)
1,15,SAM,I was lookin’ for ya.
1,15,JENKINS,"Oh, yeah?"
1,15,SAM,Yeah.
1,15,JENKINS,"Well, no offense, but this is a piss-poor rescue."
1,15,SAM,"Well, my brother’s out there right now, too. He’s lookin’ for us. So—"
1,15,JENKINS,"So, he’s not gonna find us. We’re in the middle of nowhere. (He nods towards the door leading into the building.) Waiting for them to come back and do God-knows-what to us."
1,15,SAM,What are they? Have you seen them?
1,15,JENKINS,What are you talking about?
1,15,SAM,"Whatever’s got us, what’d they look like?"
1,15,JENKINS,"See for yourself. (The door to the building opens and two men wearing black coats and hats walk in. One man walks over to JENKINS’ cage and kicks the side of it. JENKINS moves back into the corner. The other man goes to a panel of buttons attached to a pole in the middle of the room. He inserts a key into the panel and twists it. JENKINs’ cage unlocks. The men enter.) Leave me alone! Don’t you take me, leave me alone! (The men place a plate of food in front of JENKINS. They leave the cage and walk over to the panel. One of the men twists the key again and removes it, which locks the cage. They leave, and JENKINS devours his food.)"
1,15,SAM,(to himself) I’ll be damned. They’re just people.
1,15,JENKINS,Yeah. What’d you expect?
1,15,SAM,How often do they feed you?
1,15,JENKINS,Once a day. And they use that thing over there to open the cage. (He points to the panel.)
1,15,SAM,And that’s the only time you see ‘em?
1,15,JENKINS,So far. But I’m waitin’.
1,15,SAM,Waitin’ for what?
1,15,JENKINS,"Ned Beatty time, man."
1,15,SAM,I think that’s the least of your worries right now.
1,15,JENKINS,"Oh, yeah?"
1,15,SAM,Yeah.
1,15,JENKINS,"What do you think they want, then? (SAM reaches through the top of his cage and grabs a long metal wire stretching from the top of the pole to the ground. He tries to pull it down.)"
1,15,SAM,Depends on who they are.
1,15,JENKINS,"They’re a bunch of psycho hillbilly rednecks, if you ask me. Lookin’ for love in all the wrong places. (SAM continues to pull on the wire. It gradually starts to detach from the pole.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,INT. - Sheriff’s car. KATHLEEN and DEAN are driving.)
1,15,KATHLEEN,"(pointing to a passing traffic camera) Okay, the next traffic cam is fifty miles from here, and the pickup didn’t pass that one, so…."
1,15,DEAN,"So, it must’ve pulled off somewhere. I didn’t see any other roads here."
1,15,KATHLEEN,"Well, a lot of these backwoods properties have their own private roads."
1,15,DEAN,(annoyed) Great. (He stares out the window. New information comes up on KATHLEEN’s computer. She clicks the highlighted item and brings up a page about DEAN’s fake ID. She reads it and looks concerned.)
1,15,KATHLEEN,"So, Gregory. (DEAN turns to look at her.)"
1,15,DEAN,Yeah?
1,15,KATHLEEN,I ran your badge number. It’s routine when we’re working a case with state police. For accounting purposes and what have you.
1,15,DEAN,Mmhmm.
1,15,KATHLEEN,"And, uh, they just got back to me. (She pulls the car over to the side of the road.) It says here your badge was stolen. (DEAN looks surprised.) And there’s a picture of you. (She turns the computer to DEAN. He sees a picture of a heavy African-American man.)"
1,15,DEAN,I lost some weight. (He chuckles.) And I got that Michael Jackson skin disease. (KATHLEEN takes off her seatbelt.)
1,15,KATHLEEN,"Okay, would you step out of the car, please?"
1,15,DEAN,"Look, look, look. (She stops.) If you wanna arrest me, that’s fine. I’ll cooperate, I swear. But, first, please—let me find Sam."
1,15,KATHLEEN,I don’t even know who you are. Or if this Sam person is missing.
1,15,DEAN,Look into my eyes and tell me if I’m lying about this.
1,15,KATHLEEN,Identity theft? You’re impersonating an officer.
1,15,DEAN,"Look, here’s the thing. When we were young, I pretty much pulled him from a fire. And ever since then, I’ve felt responsible for him. Like it’s my job to keep him safe. I’m just afraid if we don’t find him fast—please. (His voice breaks.) He’s my family."
1,15,KATHLEEN,"I’m sorry. You’ve given me no choice. I have to take you in. (She glances at her visor. Her eye catches a photo of her and another man, smiling. She looks sad and sighs.) After we find Sam Winchester. (She fastens her seatbelt. DEAN looks confused.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,Unknown location. SAM is still trying to pull the metal coil from the beam.)
1,15,JENKINS,"What’s your name, again?"
1,15,SAM,It’s Sam.
1,15,JENKINS,"Why don’t you give it up, Sammy, there’s no way out."
1,15,SAM,Don’t….call me….Sammy! (He groans and finally tears the coil down. A small piece of metal falls on the floor also.)
1,15,JENKINS,What is it? (SAM picks it up and looks at it.)
1,15,SAM,It’s a bracket.
1,15,JENKINS,"Well, thank God, a bracket. Now we’ve got ‘em, huh? (Suddenly, JENKINS’ cage unlocks itself and opens.) Must’ve been short. (He climbs out of the cage.) Maybe you knocked somethin’ loose."
1,15,SAM,"I think you should get back in there, Jenkins."
1,15,JENKINS,What?
1,15,SAM,This isn’t right.
1,15,JENKINS,Don’t you wanna get out of here?
1,15,SAM,Yeah. But that was too easy.
1,15,JENKINS,"Look, I’m gonna get out of here, and I’m gonna send help, okay, don’t worry."
1,15,SAM,"No, I’m serious. Jenkins—this might be a trap."
1,15,JENKINS,"Bye, Sammy. (He pushes open the door and leaves.)"
1,15,SAM,"Jenkins! (On the other side of the door, JENKINS is in another room similar to the one he just left. He finds an exit and leaves. In the other room, JENKINS’ cage slams shut.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,Outside. JENKINS is walking around the outside of a rundown house. He finds a knife on the ground and picks it up. He looks up to the sky.)
1,15,JENKINS,Thank you. (He starts running into the woods.)
1,15,(CUT TO,"Woods. JENKINS continues walking. He hears a noise and raises his knife, then starts to run in the rain. Before long, a man in camouflage jumps in front of him and knocks him down with a long knife. JENKINS falls to the ground, but sticks his own knife in the man’s leg. The man stumbles, allowing JENKINS to get up and run away. JENKINS reaches a clearing. He looks around, lost. Suddenly, another camouflaged man appears and puts his knife through JENKINS’ leg, then removes it. The second camouflaged man appears, and they both point their knives at JENKINS, who is on the ground. He is able to get up and run away. The men watch him and laugh. JENKINS keeps running, but trips over a thin wire on the ground. The men catch up to him and raise their knives.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,Unknown location. SAM can hear JENKINS screaming. The screen goes black.)
1,15,(FADE IN,"Street. DEAN and KATHLEEN are walking back to the car, holding cups of coffee.)"
1,15,DEAN,"Hey, Officer? Look, I don’t mean to press my luck."
1,15,KATHLEEN,Your luck is so pressed.
1,15,DEAN,"Right. I was wondering—why are you helping me out, anyway? Why don’t you just lock me up?"
1,15,KATHLEEN,"My brother, Riley, disappeared three years ago. A lot like Sam. We searched for him, but—nothing. I know what it’s like to feel responsible for someone, and for them—Come on. Let’s keep at it. (She gets in the car.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,Edge of the forest. KATHLEEN and DEAN are driving by.)
1,15,DEAN,"(OS) Wait, wait, wait—pull over here. Pull over. (They pull over and get out of the car, then walk towards the forest.) It’s the first turn-off I’ve seen so far."
1,15,KATHLEEN,"You stay here, I’ll check it out."
1,15,DEAN,No way.
1,15,KATHLEEN,"Hey. (They stop walking.) You’re a civilian. And a felon, I think. I’m not taking you with me."
1,15,DEAN,You’re not goin’ without me. (KATHLEEN sighs.)
1,15,KATHLEEN,Alright. You promise you won’t get involved? You’ll let me handle it?
1,15,DEAN,"Yeah, I promise."
1,15,KATHLEEN,"Shake on it. (She extends her hand. DEAN shakes it. While they are shaking hands, KATHLEEN places a set of handcuffs on DEAN’s arm.)"
1,15,DEAN,"Oh, come on."
1,15,(CUT TO,Car. KATHLEEN handcuffs DEAN to the door handle and starts walking away.)
1,15,DEAN,"This is ridiculous. Kathleen, I really think you’re gonna need my help."
1,15,KATHLEEN,I’ll manage. Thank you. (She locks the door and walks away.)
1,15,DEAN,I gotta start carrying paper clips.
1,15,(CUT TO,"Road. KATHLEEN is walking. She passes a rundown barn, along with several wagon wheels strewn along the grass. She walks further and sees a dilapidated house. She makes her way to the front porch and climbs up the stairs.)"
1,15,KATHLEEN,"Hello? Anybody home? (She knocks on the door. A young girl, MISSY, comes outside, covered in dirt and filth. She is unwashed and has long, uncombed hair.) Hi. Who are you? (The girl comes closer and examines KATHLEEN’s badge.)"
1,15,MISSY,Who are you?
1,15,KATHLEEN,"I’m, uh, I’m Kathleen. I’m a deputy. What’s your name?"
1,15,MISSY,Missy.
1,15,KATHLEEN,"Missy. That’s a pretty name. Missy, is your mom home?"
1,15,MISSY,She’s dead.
1,15,KATHLEEN,I’m sorry. What about your dad? (MISSY shakes her head.) No? Can I come in for a minute? (MISSY shakes her head again and starts moving towards the door.) I just want you to look at a picture. (She takes a picture of SAM from her coat pocket and shows it to MISSY.) Have you seen that guy? Look at that picture. (MISSY looks up and sees something behind KATHLEEN. She smiles wickedly.) What?
1,15,MISSY,"That’s gonna hurt. (KATHLEEN turns around and sees a tall, equally unwashed man, PA BENDER, standing beside her. He hits her in the head with a shovel, and she falls to the ground, unconscious.)"
1,15,PA,"Missy, sweetheart, go tell your brothers I wanna see ‘em."
1,15,MISSY,"Yes, Daddy. (She walks away.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,"Car. DEAN is looking around for something to unlock the handcuffs. He finally notices the antenna of the car and reaches for it, but he is too far away. He hears the screech of the pickup truck.)"
1,15,DEAN,"Oh, son of a bitch. (He stretches further.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,Woods. The pickup truck is driving.)
1,15,(CUT TO,Car. DEAN is still reaching for the antenna.)
1,15,(CUT TO,Woods. JARED and LEE BENDER unlock a gate and start walking.)
1,15,(CUT TO,Car. DEAN finally grabs the antenna and begins to unscrew it.)
1,15,(CUT TO,Woods. JARED and LEE are still walking.)
1,15,(CUT TO,"Car. The antenna comes loose and falls to the ground. DEAN picks it up and begins unlocking the handcuffs. JARED and LEE reach a clearing and see the car. They laugh. The camera pans to the side of the car, but DEAN is gone.)"
1,15,LEE,"Well, I’ve never seen him so angry before."
1,15,JARED,"Well, Lee, never been followed by the police before. (LEE, who now has KATHLEEN’s keys, unlocks the car door and gets in.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,"Barn. KATHLEEN is in a cage. She is wearing a dirty white T-shirt, and her hair is down. She wakes up and groans, massaging her head.)"
1,15,SAM,(OS) You alright?
1,15,KATHLEEN,Are you Sam Winchester?
1,15,SAM,Yeah.
1,15,KATHLEEN,"Your, uh, your cousin’s looking for you."
1,15,SAM,(relieved) Thank God. Where is he?
1,15,KATHLEEN,"I, uh—I cuffed him to my car. (SAM sighs. The door opens and DEAN enters, but KATHLEEN and SAM do not know it is him. DEAN observes the barn, disgusted. He sees SAM in his cage.)"
1,15,DEAN,Sam? (SAM smiles.) Are you hurt?
1,15,SAM,No.
1,15,DEAN,"Damn, it’s good to see you."
1,15,KATHLEEN,How did you get out of the cuffs? (DEAN turns around and sees her.)
1,15,DEAN,"Oh, I know a trick or two. (She stares at him, confused.) Alright. (He moves to the door of the cage and sees the locks.) Oh, these locks look like they’re gonna be a bitch."
1,15,SAM,"Well, there’s some kind of automatic control right there. (He points to the control panel.)"
1,15,DEAN,Have you seen ‘em?
1,15,SAM,"Yeah. Dude, they’re just people."
1,15,DEAN,"And they jumped you? Must be gettin’ a little rusty there, kiddo. (He walks over to the control panel and starts trying different buttons.) What do they want?"
1,15,SAM,"I don’t know. They let Jenkins go, but that was some sort of trap. It doesn’t make any sense to me."
1,15,DEAN,"Well, that’s the point. You know, with our usual playmates, there’s rules, there’s patterns. But with people, they’re just crazy."
1,15,SAM,See anything else out there?
1,15,DEAN,"Uh, he has about a dozen junked cars hidden out back. Plates from all over, so I’m thinkin’ when they take someone, they take their car, too."
1,15,KATHLEEN,Did you see a black Mustang out there? About ten years old?
1,15,DEAN,"Yeah, actually, I did. (She looks sad.) Your brother’s? (She nods.) I’m sorry. (He pauses.) Let’s get you guys out of here, then we’ll take care of those bastards. (He points to the control panel.) This thing takes a key. Key?"
1,15,SAM,I don’t know.
1,15,DEAN,"Alright, I better go find it. (He goes to leave.)"
1,15,SAM,Hey. (DEAN stops and turns around.) Be careful.
1,15,DEAN,Yeah. (He leaves.)
1,15,(CUT TO,"INT. – House. DEAN is in another dark room. He turns on his flashlight and starts to look around. The room is filled with shelves of jars and bottles, which contain various body parts. DEAN looks at a container filled with an unrecognizable item.)"
1,15,DEAN,Yikes. (He keeps searching the room and comes across a wall full of Polaroid pictures. Each photo shows JARED and LEE standing next to a dead body. He notices a picture of them holding JENKINS’ corpse.) I’ll say it again—demons I get. People are crazy. (He moves to a flight of stairs and climbs them.)
1,15,(CUT TO,"Upstairs. PA BENDER is in the kitchen, butchering something. DEAN comes upstairs and looks around the living room. A record is playing in the background. DEAN bumps into a windchime."
1,15,DEAN,Shh. It’s okay. I’m not gonna hurt you. (She holds up a knife.)
1,15,MISSY,"I know. (She sticks the knife into DEAN’s jacket, pinning him against the wall.) Daddy!"
1,15,DEAN,Jeez!
1,15,MISSY,"Daddy! (DEAN removes the knife. JARED and LEE come downstairs.) Daddy! (JARED grabs DEAN under his arms. LEE walks towards them, but DEAN jumps up and kicks him. JARED throws DEAN into the wall, causing the knife to fall to the floor. LEE runs towards DEAN, but DEAN grabs him first and pushes him to the ground. He then punches JARED, but is thrown into the wall again by LEE. All three of them stand up.)"
1,15,DEAN,"(pointing to JARED) I’m gonna kick your ass first. (He points to LEE.) Then yours. (PA comes up behind DEAN and hits him over the head with a pan. DEAN falls to the floor, unconscious. The screen goes black.)"
1,15,(FADE IN,"Living room. The Benders are crowded around DEAN, who is sitting in a chair, with his hands tied behind his back. He wakes up, groaning.)"
1,15,LEE,(to PA) Come on. Let us hunt him.
1,15,JARED,"Yeah, this one’s a fighter. Sure would be fun to hunt. (PA laughs.)"
1,15,DEAN,"Oh, you gotta be kiddin’ me. That’s what this is about? You -- you yahoos hunt people?"
1,15,PA,You ever killed before?
1,15,DEAN,"Wh-- (laughs) Well, that depends on what you mean."
1,15,PA,"I’ve hunted all my life. Just like my father, his before him. I’ve hunted deer and bear—I even got a cougar once. Oh boy. But the best hunt is human. Oh, there’s nothin’ like it. Holdin’ their life in your hands. Seein’ the fear in their eyes just before they go dark. Makes you feel powerful alive."
1,15,DEAN,You’re a sick puppy.
1,15,PA,"We give ‘em a weapon. Give ‘em a fightin’ chance. It’s kind of like our tradition passed down, father to son. Of course, only one or two a year. Never enough to bring the law down, we never been that sloppy."
1,15,DEAN,"Yeah, well, don’t sell yourself short. You’re plenty sloppy."
1,15,PA,"So, what, you with that pretty cop? (MISSY looks up at her brother with a smile.) Are you a cop?"
1,15,DEAN,"If I tell you, you promise not to make me into an ashtray? (PA looks angry. LEE walks over and punches DEAN.)"
1,15,PA,Only reason I don’t let my boys take you right here and now is that there’s somethin’ I need to know. (He walks to the fireplace and takes a hot poker.)
1,15,DEAN,"Yeah, how ‘bout it’s not nice to marry your sister?"
1,15,PA,Tell me—any of the cops gonna come lookin’ for you?
1,15,DEAN,"Oh, eat me. No, no, no, wait, wait, wait—you actually might. (JARED walks over to DEAN and holds his head in place.)"
1,15,PA,"You think this is funny? You brought this down on my family. Alright, you wanna play games? We’ll play some games. Looks like we’re gonna have a hunt tonight after all, boys. (to DEAN) And you get to pick the animal. The boy or the cop?"
1,15,DEAN,"Okay, wait, wait—look, nobody’s comin’ for me, alright? It’s just us."
1,15,PA,"You don’t choose, I will. (He places the hot poker on DEAN’s shirt. DEAN screams in pain. PA removes the poker.)"
1,15,DEAN,"Ah, you son of a bitch! (PA places the poker barely an inch from DEAN’s eye.)"
1,15,PA,"Next time, I’ll take an eye."
1,15,DEAN,"Alright, the guy, the guy! Take the guy! (JARED lets go of DEAN’s head, and PA moves the poker. He takes a key from around his neck and hands it to LEE.)"
1,15,PA,"Lee, go do it. Don’t let him out, though. Shoot him in the cage. (LEE walks to the door.)"
1,15,DEAN,What? I thought you said you were gonna hunt him. You were gonna give him a chance.
1,15,PA,"Lee, when you’re done with the boy—shoot the bitch, too. (LEE nods and leaves, with his rifle.) Better clean this mess up before any more cops come runnin’ out here. (DEAN looks scared.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,Barn. LEE enters and walks over to the control panel. He inserts the key and twists it.)
1,15,SAM,What are you doing? (The door to his cage unlocks and LEE walks towards him. SAM notices the bracket on the floor and grabs it. LEE opens the cage door and aims his gun.)
1,15,KATHLEEN,Hey!
1,15,(CUT TO,Living Room. DEAN and the three Benders can hear a gunshot.)
1,15,DEAN,"You hurt my brother, I’ll kill you, I swear. I’ll kill you all. I will kill you all! (PA stands up and walks towards the open front door.)"
1,15,PA,Lee!
1,15,(CUT TO,"Barn. SAM and LEE are both out of the cage. SAM is on top of LEE. He grabs the gun and hits LEE in the face with it three times. LEE collapses on the floor. SAM tries to fire the gun, but it does not work.)"
1,15,SAM,Damn.
1,15,(CUT TO,Living Room.)
1,15,PA,"Lee! (LEE does not respond. PA turns to the other three.) Jared, you come with me. Missy, you watch him now. (JARED grabs two rifles, hands one to PA, and they both leave. MISSY remains next to DEAN, holding a knife dangerously close to his eye.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,"Barn. LEE and JARED enter, guns raised, and look around.)"
1,15,PA,"Lee! Where are ya? Lee! (They find LEE unconscious, locked in SAM’s cage.) Damn it, Jared, get the lights! (JARED moves over to the light switch and pushes it up. The barn remains dark.)"
1,15,JARED,"They must have blown the fuses. (PA tries the control panel, but it is broken. They move into another room of the barn. SAM hides behind a bale of hay. LEE and JARED hear a noise. JARED looks around in one area of the room, while PA climbs a ladder leading to a balcony. KATHLEEN moves to a cabinet, unseen, and opens it, but she hears a noise and stops. JARED also hears something. He walks to the cabinet and stands to face it. He fires his rifle several times at the doors, but KATHLEEN does not come out. JARED opens the cabinet, but finds nothing inside but tools. He looks around the barn, when, suddenly KATHLEEN falls on top of his back. She wraps her arms around his neck and wrestles with him, before being knocked to the ground. Meanwhile, PA is chasing after SAM. He fires his rifle twice, but SAM escapes. While KATHLEEN is on the ground, JARED aims his gun at her.) You stupid bitch. (He gets ready to shoot her, but SAM enters.)"
1,15,SAM,"Hey! (JARED turns around and sees SAM. He fires the gun, but SAM runs away to dodge it. At the same moment, PA walks in behind SAM and gets hit with the bullet instead. He falls to the ground. JARED cocks the gun and turns around. SAM appears behind him and grabs the gun. He hits JARED in the face with the rifle several times, and JARED collapses, unconscious. The screen goes black.)"
1,15,(FADE IN,"Barn. SAM places JARED in KATHLEEN’s cage and closes the door. He walks to the control panel and locks the cage. He makes his way over to KATHLEEN, who is standing over PA, with her gun raised.)"
1,15,KATHLEEN,"I’ll watch this one. You go ahead. (SAM stares at her, motionless.) Go ahead. (SAM leaves.)"
1,15,PA,"You hurt my family, I’m gonna bleed you, bitch."
1,15,KATHLEEN,(tearfully) You killed my brother.
1,15,PA,Your brother? (He laughs cruelly.) Now I see.
1,15,KATHLEEN,Just tell me why. (PA smiles.)
1,15,PA,"Because it’s fun. (He cackles. KATHLEEN looks at him, horrified, and fires the gun.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,"EXT. – House. DEAN and SAM walk out the front door and down the porch steps. They meet up with KATHLEEN, who is leaving the barn.)"
1,15,KATHLEEN,Where’s the girl?
1,15,DEAN,Locked her in a closet. What about the dad? (She pauses.)
1,15,KATHLEEN,Shot. Trying to escape. (All three of them exchange a look.)
1,15,(CUT TO,"EXT. – House. Later. DEAN, SAM, and KATHLEEN are leaving.)"
1,15,DEAN,I think the car’s at the police station. (KATHLEEN is listening to a woman on her walkie-talkie.)
1,15,WOMAN,Backup unit en route to your location. (KATHLEEN approaches SAM and DEAN.)
1,15,KATHLEEN,"So, state police and the FBI are gonna be here within the hour. They’re gonna wanna talk to you. I suggest that you’re both long gone by then."
1,15,DEAN,"Thanks. Hey, listen, I don’t mean to press our luck, but we’re kind of in the middle of nowhere. Think we could catch a ride?"
1,15,KATHLEEN,Start walking. Duck if you see a squad car.
1,15,SAM,Sounds great to me. Thanks.
1,15,DEAN,"Listen, uh….I’m sorry about your brother."
1,15,KATHLEEN,"Thank you. (She begins to tear up.) It was really hard not knowing what happened to him. I thought it would be easier once I knew the truth—but it isn’t really. (She pauses.) Anyway, you should go. (SAM and DEAN nod and walk away. KATHLEEN watches them leave, close to tears.)"
1,15,(CUT TO,Road. SAM and DEAN are walking.)
1,15,DEAN,Never do that again.
1,15,SAM,Do what?
1,15,DEAN,Go missin’ like that. (SAM laughs.)
1,15,SAM,You were worried about me.
1,15,DEAN,"All I’m sayin’ is, you vanish like that again, I’m not lookin’ for ya."
1,15,SAM,"Sure, you won’t."
1,15,DEAN,I’m not. (SAM chuckles.)
1,15,SAM,"So, you got sidelined by a thirteen-year-old girl, huh?"
1,15,DEAN,"Oh, shut up."
1,15,SAM,"Just sayin’, gettin’ rusty there, kiddo."
1,15,DEAN,(chuckling) Shut up. (SAM laughs. They continue walking as the screen fades to black.)
1,16,(FADE IN,"Chicago, Illinois. A young woman, MEREDITH, is walking home while listening to music on her iPod. A tall, burly man bumps into her. She gives him a disgusted look and continues to walk. Shortly after turning the corner, her iPod stops playing music. MEREDITH takes off her headphones.)"
1,16,MEREDITH,"Great. (A strong wind begins to blow around her. Garbage and leaves scatter everywhere.) Hello? (Nobody answers. She tries to ignore the wind and keeps walking. As she nears her apartment, she looks over her shoulder and sees the shadow of a man on the wall of a building. The silhouette begins to follow her. MEREDITH breaks into a run. She dashes across the street and finally reaches her apartment. Frantically, she grabs her keys and rushes to find the right one. She finds the key and opens the door, then goes inside and slams it shut.)"
1,16,(CUT TO,INT. – Apartment. MEREDITH bursts through the door and locks it behind her. She enters a code into the alarm system on the wall.)
1,16,ALARM SYSTEM,System disarmed. (MEREDITH enters another code.) System armed. (She leaves the room and goes to the kitchen to get a beer after setting down her bag and keys. MEREDITH then moves to the living room and listens to the messages on her answering machine.)
1,16,KRISTEN,"Hey, Meredith. It’s Kristen. You have to tell me what happened last night. Call me. (The beep sounds and another message begins to play. While MEREDITH listens to the message, the shadow begins to form on the wall of the apartment. It begins as a swirling cloud of smoke and morphs into the silhouette of a tall, skinny creature. The creature’s shadow slowly moves towards MEREDITH’s shadow on the wall. It sticks its long, sharp-nailed fingers through MEREDITH’s chest. MEREDITH’s blood splatters on the wall, and her shadow falls to the ground. The screen goes black.)"
1,16,(FADE IN,"EXT. – Apartment. One Week Later. SAM and DEAN stop their car across the street and get out, dressed as employees of the alarm system company. DEAN gets a toolbox from the trunk of the car, and they proceed towards the apartment.)"
1,16,SAM,"All right, Dean. This is the place."
1,16,DEAN,"You know, I’ve gotta say Dad and me did just fine without these stupid costumes. I feel like a high school drama dork. (He smiles.) What was that play that you did? What was it – Our Town. Yeah, you were good, it was cute."
1,16,SAM,"Look, you wanna pull this off or not?"
1,16,DEAN,"I’m just sayin’, these outfits cost hard-earned money, okay?"
1,16,SAM,Whose?
1,16,DEAN,Ours. You think credit card fraud is easy?
1,16,(CUT TO,"INT. – Apartment. SAM, DEAN, and the landlady enter.)"
1,16,SAM,Thanks for lettin’ us look around.
1,16,LANDLADY,"Well, the police said they were done with the place, so….(She and SAM move further into the room. DEAN shuts the apartment door and notices the chain on the door is broken. He follows SAM. In the living room, spots of blood cover the carpet.) You guys said you were with the alarm company?"
1,16,DEAN,That’s right.
1,16,LANDLADY,"Well, no offense, but your alarm’s about as useful as boobs on a man. (DEAN and SAM exchange a look.)"
1,16,DEAN,"Well, that’s why we’re here. To see what went wrong and stop it from happening again."
1,16,SAM,"Now, ma’am, you found the body?"
1,16,LANDLADY,Yeah.
1,16,SAM,Right after it happened?
1,16,LANDLADY,No. Few days later. Meredith’s work called—she hadn’t shown up. I knocked on the door. That’s when I noticed the smell.
1,16,DEAN,Any windows open? Any sign of break-in?
1,16,LANDLADY,"No, windows were locked, front door was bolted. Chain was on the door, we had to cut it just to get in."
1,16,DEAN,And the alarm was still on?
1,16,LANDLADY,"Like I said, bang-up job your company’s doin’."
1,16,DEAN,"Mmhmm. You see any overturned furniture, broken glass, signs of struggle? (The landlady shakes her head.)"
1,16,LANDLADY,Everything was in perfect condition—except Meredith.
1,16,SAM,And what condition was Meredith in?
1,16,LANDLAY,"Meredith was all over. In pieces. The guy who killed her must have been some kind of a whackjob. But I tell you, if I didn’t know any better, I’d have said a wild animal did it. (DEAN looks at SAM.)"
1,16,SAM,"Ma’am, do you mind if we take some time? Give this place a once-over?"
1,16,LANDLADY,"Oh, well, go right ahead. Knock yourself out."
1,16,(CUT TO,Later. DEAN opens his toolbox and removes the EMF meter.)
1,16,DEAN,"So, a killer walks in and out of the apartment—no weapons, no prints, nothin’."
1,16,SAM,"I’m tellin’ ya, the minute I found that article, I knew this was our kind of gig. (The EMF meter beeps frantically.)"
1,16,DEAN,I think I agree with you.
1,16,SAM,"So, you talked to the cops?"
1,16,DEAN,"Uh, yeah. (He smirks.) I spoke to Amy, a, uh, charming, perky officer of the law."
1,16,SAM,Yeah? What’d you find out?
1,16,DEAN,"(dreamily) Well, she’s a Sagittarius. She loves tequila, I mean—wow. Oh, and she’s got this little tattoo—"
1,16,SAM,Dean!
1,16,DEAN,"What? Yeah. Uh, nothin’ we don’t already know. Except for one thing they’re keepin’ out of the papers."
1,16,SAM,Hm?
1,16,DEAN,Meredith’s heart was missing.
1,16,SAM,(stunned) Her heart?
1,16,DEAN,Yeah. Her heart.
1,16,SAM,"So, what do you think did it to her?"
1,16,DEAN,"Well, the landlady said it looked like an animal attack. Maybe it was—werewolf?"
1,16,SAM,"No, no werewolf, the lunar cycle’s not right. Plus, if it was a creature, it would’ve left some kind of trace. It’s probably a spirit. (DEAN observes the blood on the carpet and seems to notice something.)"
1,16,DEAN,See if you can find any masking tape around.
1,16,(CUT TO,"Later. DEAN uses the masking tape to connect each pool of blood. When he is done, the pieces of tape form an unusual symbol.)"
1,16,SAM,Ever see that symbol before?
1,16,DEAN,Never.
1,16,SAM,Me neither. (They exchange a look.)
1,16,(CUT TO,"INT. – Bar. Night. DEAN is flirting with the attractive bartender. SAM enters and looks around. DEAN notices and takes one last drink, then smiles at the bartender and leaves.)"
1,16,DEAN,"See ya. (At the other side of the room, SAM finds an empty table and sits down, taking out his father’s journal. He leafs through the pages, and shortly, DEAN sits down across from him.) I talked to the bartender."
1,16,SAM,Did you get anything? Besides her number?
1,16,DEAN,"Dude, I’m a professional. I’m offended that you would think that. (SAM gives him a knowing look.) All right, yeah. (He chuckles and holds up a napkin with the bartender’s phone number on it.)"
1,16,SAM,"You mind doin’ a little bit of thinking with your upstairs brain, Dean?"
1,16,DEAN,"Huh? Look, there’s nothing to find out. I mean, Meredith worked here, she waited tables, everyone here was her friend. Everybody said she was normal. She didn’t do or say anything weird before she died, so—what about that symbol, you find anything?"
1,16,SAM,"Nope, nothing. It wasn’t in Dad’s journal or in any of the usual books. I just have to dig a little deeper, I guess."
1,16,DEAN,"Well, there was a first victim, right? Before Meredith?"
1,16,SAM,"Right. Yeah. (He pulls out a newspaper clipping concerning the first death.) His name was, uh—his name was Ben Swardstrom. (He hands the clipping to DEAN.) Last month he was found mutilated in his town house. Same deal—the door was locked, the alarm was on."
1,16,DEAN,Is there any connection between the two of them?
1,16,SAM,"Not that I can tell—I mean, not yet, at least. Ben was a banker, Meredith was a waitress. They never met, never knew anyone in common—they were practically from different worlds."
1,16,DEAN,"So, to recap, the only successful intel we’ve scored so far is the bartender’s phone number. (He smirks. SAM seems to notice something at the other side of the room. DEAN looks around.) What? (SAM gets up and begins walking away.) Sam? (SAM continues to walk away. He reaches another table, where a young woman with short blonde hair is seated with her back to him. He puts his hand on her shoulder, and she turns around. It is MEG.)"
1,16,SAM,Meg.
1,16,MEG,Sam! (SAM looks at her curiously. The screen goes black.)
1,16,(FADE IN,Bar. SAM is still with MEG at her table.)
1,16,MEG,"Sam! Is that you? Oh, my God! (She stands up and they hug. SAM looks slightly puzzled. They pull away a few seconds later.) What are you doing here?"
1,16,SAM,"I’m just in town, visiting friends. (MEG looks around.)"
1,16,MEG,Where are they?
1,16,SAM,"Well, they’re not here right now, but what about you, Meg? I thought you were goin’ to California. (DEAN comes up behind SAM.)"
1,16,MEG,"Oh, I did. I came, I saw, I conquered. Oh, and I met what’s-his-name, something Michael Murray at a bar."
1,16,SAM,Who?
1,16,MEG,"Oh, it doesn’t matter. Anyway, the whole scene got old, so I’m living here for a while. (DEAN clears his throat loudly, but he is ignored.)"
1,16,SAM,You’re from Chicago?
1,16,MEG,"No, Massachusetts—Andover. Gosh, Sam, what are the odds we’d run into each other?"
1,16,SAM,"Yeah, I know, I thought I’d never see you again."
1,16,MEG,"Well, I’m glad you were wrong. (SAM nods. DEAN clears his throat again, louder this time.) Dude, cover your mouth."
1,16,SAM,"Yeah, um, I’m sorry, Meg. This is, uh—this is my brother, Dean. (MEG is surprised.)"
1,16,MEG,This is Dean? (DEAN smiles.)
1,16,SAM,Yeah.
1,16,DEAN,"So, you’ve heard of me?"
1,16,MEG,"Oh, yeah. I’ve heard of you. Nice—the way you treat your brother like luggage. (He looks confused.)"
1,16,DEAN,Sorry?
1,16,MEG,Why don’t you let him do what he wants to do? Stop dragging him over God’s green earth.
1,16,SAM,"Meg, it’s all right. (The three of them look around quietly. DEAN whistles lowly.)"
1,16,DEAN,"Okay, awkward. I’m gonna get a drink now. (He gives SAM a puzzled look, then walks over to the bar.)"
1,16,MEG,"Sam, I’m sorry. It’s just—the way you told me he treats you....if it were me, I’d kill him."
1,16,SAM,It’s all right. He means well. (MEG nods.)
1,16,MEG,"Well, we should hook up while you’re in town."
1,16,SAM,Yeah.
1,16,MEG,I’ll show you a hell of a time.
1,16,SAM,"You know what, that sounds great. Why don’t you, uh—why don’t you give me your number? (He takes out his cell phone and gets ready to input MEG’s number.)"
1,16,MEG,312-555-0143.
1,16,SAM,"You know what, I never got your last name."
1,16,MEG,Masters.
1,16,SAM,Masters?
1,16,MEG,"So, you better call."
1,16,SAM,Scout’s Honor.
1,16,MEG,"I hope to see you around, Sam. (He smiles at her and walks away.)"
1,16,(CUT TO,EXT. – Bar. DEAN and SAM are walking back to the car.)
1,16,DEAN,Who the hell was she?
1,16,SAM,"I don’t really know. I only met her once. Meeting up with her again? I don’t know, man, it’s weird."
1,16,DEAN,"And what was she saying? I treat you like luggage? What, were you bitchin’ about me to some chick?"
1,16,SAM,"Look, I’m sorry, Dean. It was when we had that huge fight when I was in that bus stop in Indiana. But that’s not important, just listen—"
1,16,DEAN,"Well, is there any truth to what she’s saying? I mean, am I keeping you against your will, Sam?"
1,16,SAM,"No, of course not. Now, would you listen?"
1,16,DEAN,What?
1,16,SAM,"I think there’s somethin’ strange going on here, Dean."
1,16,DEAN,"Yeah, tell me about it. She wasn’t even that into me."
1,16,SAM,"No, man, I mean like our kind of strange. Like, maybe even a lead."
1,16,DEAN,Why do you say that?
1,16,SAM,"I met Meg weeks ago, literally on the side of the road. And now, I run into her in some random Chicago bar? I mean, the same bar where a waitress was slaughtered by something supernatural? You don’t think that’s a little weird?"
1,16,DEAN,"I don’t know, random coincidence. It happens."
1,16,SAM,"Yeah, it happens, but not to us. Look, I could be wrong, I’m just sayin’ that there’s something about this girl that I can’t quite put my finger on. (DEAN smirks.)"
1,16,DEAN,"Well, I bet you’d like to. I mean, maybe she’s not a suspect, maybe you’ve got a thing for her, huh? (SAM rolls his eyes and laughs.) Maybe you’re thinkin’ a little too much with your upstairs brain, huh? (He points to his head and grins. SAM becomes serious again.)"
1,16,SAM,"Do me a favor. Check and see if there’s really a Meg Masters from Andover, Massachusetts, and see if you can’t dig anything up on that symbol on Meredith’s floor."
1,16,DEAN,What are you gonna do?
1,16,SAM,I’m gonna watch Meg.
1,16,DEAN,"(laughing) Yeah, you are."
1,16,SAM,I just wanna see what’s what. Better safe than sorry.
1,16,DEAN,"All right, you little pervert."
1,16,SAM,Dude.
1,16,DEAN,"I’m goin’, I’m goin’. (He crosses the street and leaves SAM.)"
1,16,(FADE TO,"Motel Room. DEAN is on the computer, researching MEG and the symbol. He picks up his cell phone and dials a number. SAM picks up. The scene alternates between the motel room and the car, where SAM is parked outside MEG’s apartment.)"
1,16,SAM,Hey.
1,16,DEAN,"Let me guess. You’re lurkin’ outside that poor girl’s apartment, aren’t you?"
1,16,SAM,No. (DEAN waits for another response. SAM rolls his eyes.) Yes.
1,16,DEAN,You’ve got a funny way of showin’ your affection.
1,16,SAM,Did you find anything on her or what?
1,16,DEAN,"Sorry, man, she checks out. There is a Meg Masters in the Andover phonebook. I even pulled up her high school photo. Now, look, why don’t you go knock on her door and, uh, invite her to a poetry reading, or whatever it is you do, huh?"
1,16,SAM,(ignoring his comment) What about the symbol? Any luck?
1,16,DEAN,"Yeah, that I did have some luck with. (He looks down at his research.) It’s, uh—turns out it’s Zoroastrian. Very, very old school, like two thousand years before Christ. It’s a sigil for a Daeva."
1,16,SAM,What’s a Daeva?
1,16,DEAN,"It translates to “demon of darkness”. Zoroastrian demons, and they’re savage, animalistic, you know, nasty attitudes—kind of like, uh, demonic pit bulls."
1,16,SAM,How’d you figure that out?
1,16,DEAN,"Give me some credit, man. You don’t have a corner on paper chasin’ around here."
1,16,SAM,"Oh, yeah? Name the last book you read."
1,16,DEAN,"(defeated) No, I called Dad’s friend, Caleb. He told me, all right?"
1,16,SAM,Yeah. (He glances up at MEG’s dark bedroom window.)
1,16,DEAN,"Anyway, here’s the thing—these Daevas, they have to be summoned, conjured."
1,16,SAM,"So, someone’s controlling it?"
1,16,DEAN,"Yeah, that’s what I’m sayin’. And, from what I gather, it’s pretty risky business, too. These suckers tend to bite the hand that feeds them. And, uh, the arms, and torsos."
1,16,SAM,"So, what do they look like?"
1,16,DEAN,"Well, nobody knows, but nobody’s seen ‘em for a couple of millennia. I mean, summoning a demon that ancient? Someone really knows their stuff. I think we’ve got a major player in town. Now, why don’t you go give that girl a private strip-o-gram?"
1,16,SAM,Bite me.
1,16,DEAN,"No, bite her. Don’t leave teeth marks, though—(SAM hangs up.) Sam? Are you—? (He hangs up his own phone. Back at the car, SAM glances back up at MEG’s window. A few seconds later, a light turns on. MEG enters her bedroom, wearing a black lace bra. SAM looks around uncomfortably, then continues to watch MEG. She puts on a T-shirt. SAM is interrupted by someone clearing their throat. He turns and sees a woman standing outside the car, looking annoyed. She gestures to the window.)"
1,16,SAM,"Oh, no, no, no, I’m just—"
1,16,WOMAN,"Pervert. (She walks away angrily. SAM is stunned. A second later, MEG leaves her apartment, now wearing a sweatshirt and jacket as well. She walks across the street, briefly glancing at the parked car. Once she is gone, SAM, who had been hiding, sits up. He gets out of the car and follows her.)"
1,16,(CUT TO,"Street. MEG stops at a graffiti-covered wall. She looks around before pulling open a door, which seems to be part of the wall. When she is inside, SAM peers out from behind a building. He also walks to the wall and enters through the camouflaged door.)"
1,16,(CUT TO,"INT. – Warehouse. SAM enters and walks up a flight of stairs. He reaches a door at the top, which he attempts to open, but it is locked. He looks around and sees a broken down elevator gate. He enters the gate and begins to climb the side of it, using different bars as footrests. When he reaches the top, he is able to peer through the gate into a dimly lit room. There is a black altar in the middle of the room. SAM sees MEG enter and walk over to the altar. He keeps watching silently while hanging on to the bars of the gate. MEG reaches the altar and picks up a silver bowl filled with blood. She swirls her finger around in the liquid and speaks an incantation in an ancient language. She then begins to speak to someone neither the audience nor SAM can hear.)"
1,16,MEG,"I don’t think you should come. (…) Because the brothers, they’re in town, I didn’t know that—(…) Yes, sir. (…) Yes, I’ll be here—waiting for you. (SAM looks confused. MEG sets down the bowl and blows out the candles at the altar, then leaves the room. Once she is gone, SAM moves to the wall, where there is a space through which he can crawl. He hoists himself up and climbs into the room. SAM walks to the altar and observes it. He sees several human hearts on the table, along with other ancient items. In the middle of the altar is the Zoroastrian symbol, drawn in blood.)"
1,16,SAM,What the hell—? (The screen goes black.)
1,16,(FADE IN,Motel Room. SAM enters and looks around for DEAN. They see each other.)
1,16,(CUT TO,Later. SAM and DEAN are talking.)
1,16,DEAN,"So, hot little Meg is summoning the Daeva?"
1,16,SAM,Looks like she was using that black altar to control the thing.
1,16,DEAN,"So, Sammy’s got a thing for the bad girl. (He chuckles. SAM rolls his eyes.) And what’s the deal with that bowl again?"
1,16,SAM,She was talking into it. The way witches used to scry into crystal balls or animal entrails. She was communicating with someone.
1,16,DEAN,With who? With the Daeva?
1,16,SAM,"No, you said those things were savages. No, this was someone different. Someone who’s giving her orders. Someone who’s comin’ to that warehouse. (DEAN thinks for a moment and glances at some files on a nearby table. He sits down at the table and looks through them.)"
1,16,DEAN,Holy crap.
1,16,SAM,What?
1,16,DEAN,"What I was gonna tell you earlier—I pulled a favor with my – (he clears his throat) – friend, Amy, over at the police department. The complete records of the two victims—we missed something the first time."
1,16,SAM,What? (He comes over to look at the records.)
1,16,DEAN,"The first victim, the old man—he spent his whole life in Chicago, but he wasn’t born here. Look where he was born. (He points to something on the page.)"
1,16,SAM,"Lawrence, Kansas."
1,16,DEAN,"Mmhmm. (He picks up the second file.) Meredith, second victim—turns out she was adopted. And guess where she’s from. (The paper reads “Lawrence, Kansas”. SAM sits down across from DEAN, clearly shocked.)"
1,16,SAM,Holy crap.
1,16,DEAN,Yeah.
1,16,SAM,"I mean, it is where the demon killed Mom. That’s where everything started. So, you think Meg’s tied up with the demon?"
1,16,DEAN,I think it’s a definite possibility.
1,16,SAM,But I don’t understand. What’s the significance of Lawrence? And how do these Daeva things fit in?
1,16,DEAN,"Beats me. But I say we trash that black altar, grab Meg, and have ourselves a friendly little interrogation."
1,16,SAM,"No, we can’t. We shouldn’t tip her off. We’ve gotta stake out that warehouse. We’ve gotta see who, or what, is showin’ up to meet her."
1,16,DEAN,I’ll tell you one thing. I don’t think we should do this alone.
1,16,(CUT TO,"Motel Room. Later. DEAN is leaving a message on John’s voicemail. While he is talking, SAM enters the room with bags full of weapons.)"
1,16,DEAN,"We think we’ve got a serious lead on the thing that killed Mom. So, uh, this warehouse—it’s 1435 West Erie. Dad, if you get this, get to Chicago as soon as you can. (He hangs up.)"
1,16,SAM,Voicemail?
1,16,DEAN,"Yeah. (He gestures to the bags) Jesus, what’d you get? (SAM chuckles.)"
1,16,SAM,"I ransacked that trunk. Holy water, every weapon that I could think of, exorcism rituals from about a half dozen religions. I’m not sure what to expect, so I guess we should just expect everything. (DEAN nods, and they begin loading their guns silently.)"
1,16,DEAN,Big night.
1,16,SAM,Yeah. You nervous?
1,16,DEAN,"No. Why, are you?"
1,16,SAM,"No. No way. (They are silent for a few seconds.) God, could you imagine if we actually found that damn thing? That demon?"
1,16,DEAN,"Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, all right?"
1,16,SAM,"I know. I’m just sayin’, what if we did? What if this whole thing was over tonight? Man, I’d sleep for a month. Go back to school—be a person again."
1,16,DEAN,You wanna go back to school?
1,16,SAM,"Yeah, once we’re done huntin’ the thing."
1,16,DEAN,Huh.
1,16,SAM,"Why, is there somethin’ wrong with that?"
1,16,DEAN,"No. No, it’s, uh, great. Good for you."
1,16,SAM,"I mean, what are you gonna do when it’s all over?"
1,16,DEAN,It’s never gonna be over. There’s gonna be others. There’s always gonna be somethin’ to hunt.
1,16,SAM,But there’s got to be somethin’ that you want for yourself—
1,16,DEAN,"Yeah, I don’t want you to leave the second this thing’s over, Sam. (He walks over to the dresser.)"
1,16,SAM,"Dude, what’s your problem? (DEAN is silent for a while, then turns back to SAM.)"
1,16,DEAN,"Why do you think I drag you everywhere? Huh? I mean, why do you think I came and got you at Stanford in the first place?"
1,16,SAM,‘Cause Dad was in trouble. ‘Cause you wanted to find the thing that killed Mom.
1,16,DEAN,"Yes, that, but it’s more than that, man. (He returns to the dresser and is silent again, then once more turns to Sam.) You and me and Dad—I mean, I want us….I want us to be together again. I want us to be a family again."
1,16,SAM,"Dean, we are a family. I’d do anything for you. But things will never be the way they were before. (DEAN looks heartbroken.)"
1,16,DEAN,(sadly) Could be.
1,16,SAM,"I don’t want them to be. I'm not gonna live this life forever. Dean, when this is all over, you’re gonna have to let me go my own way. (He and DEAN share a look.)"
1,16,(CUT TO,"INT. – Warehouse. SAM and DEAN climb the elevator gate and reach the top room. MEG is standing at the altar, speaking in an ancient language. Quietly, SAM and DEAN squeeze through the space between the gate and the wall. They draw their guns and move to the other side of the room, hiding behind some crates.)"
1,16,MEG,"Guys. (SAM and DEAN look at each other, stunned.) Hiding’s a little bit childish, don’t you think?"
1,16,DEAN,"Well, that didn’t work out like I planned. (MEG turns around to face them.)"
1,16,MEG,"Why don’t you come out? (SAM and DEAN come out from behind the crates.) Sam, I have to say, this puts a real crimp in our relationship."
1,16,SAM,"Yeah, tell me about it."
1,16,DEAN,"So, where’s your little Daeva friend?"
1,16,MEG,"Around. You know, that shotgun’s not gonna do much good."
1,16,DEAN,"Oh, don’t worry, sweetheart. The shotgun’s not for the demon."
1,16,SAM,"So, who is it, Meg? Who’s coming? Who are you waiting for?"
1,16,MEG,You. (The shadow demon begins to form on the wall. It knocks SAM to the ground and throws DEAN into the crates. A claw-like scratch appears on SAM’s face. The screen goes black.)
1,16,(FADE IN,Warehouse. Later. DEAN and SAM are tied to two separate posts. SAM comes to and sees MEG sitting before him.)
1,16,DEAN,"Hey, Sam? Don’t take this the wrong way, but your girlfriend...is a bitch."
1,16,SAM,"This, the whole thing, was a trap. Running into you at the bar, following you here, hearin’ what you had to say. It was all a set-up, wasn’t it? (MEG laughs.) And that the victims were from Lawrence?"
1,16,MEG,"It doesn’t mean anything. It was just to draw you in, that’s all."
1,16,SAM,You killed those two people for nothin’.
1,16,MEG,"Baby, I’ve killed a lot more for a lot less."
1,16,DEAN,You trapped us. Good for you. It’s Miller time. (He smiles.) But why don’t you kill us already?
1,16,MEG,"Not very quick on the uptake, are we? (She leans in closer.) This trap isn’t for you. (DEAN is puzzled. SAM thinks for a second, then realizes something.)"
1,16,SAM,"Dad. It’s a trap for Dad. (DEAN looks at MEG, who smiles at him.)"
1,16,DEAN,"Oh, sweetheart—you’re dumber than you look. 'Cause even if Dad was in town, which he is not, he wouldn’t walk into something like this. He’s too good."
1,16,MEG,"He is pretty good. I’ll give you that. (She walks over to him and sits down, straddling his legs.) But you see, he has one weakness."
1,16,DEAN,What’s that?
1,16,MEG,"You. He lets his guard down around his boys, lets his emotions cloud his judgment. I happen to know he is in town. And he’ll come and try to save you. And then the Daevas will kill everybody—nice and slow and messy."
1,16,DEAN,"Well, I’ve got news for ya. It’s gonna take a lot more than some….shadow to kill him."
1,16,MEG,"Oh, the Daevas are in the room here—they’re invisible. Their shadows are just the only part you can see."
1,16,SAM,"Why you doin’ this, Meg? What kind of deal you got worked out here, huh? And with who?"
1,16,MEG,I’m doing this for the same reasons you do what you do—loyalty. Love. Like the love you had for Mommy—and Jess.
1,16,SAM,Go to hell.
1,16,MEG,"Baby, I’m already there. (She smiles and slides over to SAM.) Come on, Sam. There’s no need to be nasty. (She leans in to whisper in his ear.) I think we both know how you really feel about me. You know, I saw you watching me—changing in my apartment. Turned you on, didn’t it?"
1,16,DEAN,"Get a room, you two."
1,16,MEG,"I didn’t mind. I liked that you were watching me. Come on, Sammy. You and I can still have a little dirty fun. (She begins kissing his neck.)"
1,16,SAM,"You wanna have fun? Go ahead then. I’m a little tied up right now. (She smiles and continues to kiss him. A noise on DEAN’s side of the room makes her stop. She gets up and walks behind DEAN’s post. She sees he has a knife in his hand. She takes it away and tosses it into a corner. MEG swings around to the other side of the post, and smiles at DEAN, who chuckles guiltily. She slides back over to SAM.)"
1,16,MEG,"Now, were you just trying to distract me while your brother cuts free?"
1,16,SAM,"No. No. That’s because I have a knife of my own. (MEG is confused. SAM breaks free from his ropes and grabs MEG’s shoulders, then knocks his head against hers. She falls to the floor while he groans in pain.)"
1,16,DEAN,"Sam! Get the altar. (SAM walks over to the altar and overturns it. Suddenly, the shadow demon appears and grabs MEG. She is dragged across the floor and crashes through the window, falling down to the street below. SAM grabs his knife and cuts DEAN free from his ropes. They walk over to the window and see MEG sprawled on the sidewalk, dead.)"
1,16,SAM,"So, I guess the Daevas didn’t like being bossed around."
1,16,DEAN,"Yeah, I guess not. Hey, Sam?"
1,16,SAM,Hm?
1,16,DEAN,"Next time you wanna get laid, find a girl that’s not so buckets-o’-crazy, huh? (He smiles and walks away.)"
1,16,(CUT TO,INT. – Motel. Hallway. DEAN and SAM are walking back to their room.)
1,16,DEAN,Why didn’t you just leave that stuff in the car?
1,16,SAM,"I said it before, and I’ll say it again—better safe than sorry. (DEAN unlocks the door and they enter the room. They see the outline of a man standing by the window.)"
1,16,DEAN,Hey! (SAM turns on the light. The man turns around. It is JOHN. SAM and DEAN are stunned.) Dad?
1,16,JOHN,"Hey, boys. (DEAN and JOHN walk towards each other and share a long, emotional hug. SAM watches sadly. DEAN and JOHN pull apart a few seconds later.) Hi, Sam."
1,16,SAM,"(softly) Hey, Dad. (Sam and John do not hug, but look at each other.  Sam places the bag full of weapons on the floor.)"
1,16,DEAN,"Dad, it was a trap. I didn’t know, I’m sorry."
1,16,JOHN,It’s all right. I thought it might’ve been.
1,16,DEAN,Were you there?
1,16,JOHN,"Yeah, I got there just in time to see the girl take the swan dive. She was the bad guy, right?"
1,16,JOHN,"Good. Well, it doesn’t surprise me. It’s tried to stop me before."
1,16,SAM,The demon has?
1,16,JOHN,It knows I’m close. It knows I’m gonna kill it. Not just exorcise it or send it back to hell—actually kill it.
1,16,DEAN,How? (JOHN smiles.)
1,16,JOHN,I’m workin’ on that.
1,16,SAM,Let us come with you. We’ll help. (DEAN gives SAM a warning look.)
1,16,JOHN,"No, Sam. Not yet. Just try to understand. This demon is a scary son of a bitch. I don’t want you caught in a crossfire. I don’t want you hurt."
1,16,SAM,"Dad, you don’t have to worry about us."
1,16,JOHN,"Of course I do. I’m your father. (He pauses.) Listen, Sammy, last time we were together, we had one hell of a fight."
1,16,SAM,"Yes, sir."
1,16,JOHN,It’s good to see you again. It’s been a long time.
1,16,SAM,"Too long. (He and JOHN embrace, crying. A minute later, they pull apart. The three of them look around tearfully. Suddenly, the shadow demon attacks JOHN. He is thrown into a set of cabinets and falls to the ground. SAM also falls.)"
1,16,DEAN,"No! (He is thrown to the floor as well. Outside, MEG is watching the apartment. She looks at the building while holding a pendant around her neck, which features the Zoroastrian symbol. The screen goes black.)"
1,16,(FADE IN,"INT. – Motel Room. SAM, DEAN, and JOHN are still being attacked by the shadow demon. They groan and scream in pain as they are flung around the room. Fresh scratches appear on their faces. SAM makes his way to the bag of weapons on the floor. He removes a flare from the bag.)"
1,16,SAM,"Shut your eyes! These things are shadow demons, so let’s light ‘em up! (He lights the flare, and the room is instantly filled with smoke and a brilliant white light. The shadow demon vanishes. The three of them try to feel their way around the room, coughing and sputtering.)"
1,16,DEAN,Dad!
1,16,JOHN,"Over here! (DEAN makes his way to JOHN and helps him up. SAM follows them out of the room, carrying the bag of weapons.)"
1,16,(CUT TO,"EXT. – Motel. SAM, JOHN, and DEAN exit the building and walk down an alley to the car. SAM puts the bag in the backseat of the car.)"
1,16,SAM,"All right, come on. We don’t have much time. As soon as the flare’s out, they’ll be back."
1,16,DEAN,"Wait, wait, wait! Sam, wait. Dad, you can’t come with us."
1,16,SAM,What? What are you talkin’ about?
1,16,JOHN,You boys—you’re beat to hell.
1,16,DEAN,We’ll be all right.
1,16,SAM,"Dean, we should stick together. We’ll go after those demons—"
1,16,DEAN,"Sam! Listen to me! We almost got Dad killed in there. Don’t you understand? They’re not gonna stop.  They’re gonna try again. They’re gonna use us to get to him. I mean, Meg was right. Dad’s vulnerable when he’s with us. He—he’s stronger without us around."
1,16,SAM,Dad--no. (He puts a hand on his father’s shoulder. DEAN watches sadly.) After everything-- after all the time we spent lookin’ for you—please. I gotta be a part of this fight.
1,16,JOHN,"Sammy, this fight is just starting. And we are all gonna have a part to play. For now, you’ve got to trust me, son. (SAM shakes his head no.) Okay, you’ve gotta let me go. (All three of them are silent for a moment, close to tears. Finally, SAM looks at his hand on his dad's shoulder, and then pats his father’s shoulder once, then lets go. JOHN and DEAN share a look, then JOHN walks to his truck. Once there, he looks back at them one more time.) Be careful, boys. (He gets in his truck and drives away.)"
1,16,DEAN,"Come on. (He and SAM get into the car and watch as their father’s truck turns the corner. DEAN and SAM look at each other knowingly. Without a word, DEAN starts the car. He backs into the street, then speeds down the road and around a corner. MEG comes onto the street from a flight of stairs. She turns and watches the boys leave as the screen fades to black.)"
1,17,DEAN appears.,HEY!
1,18,MICHAEL,You said you were a big brother.
1,19,PROPRIETOR,"Let's look. Ahh...(begins reading) ""People who knew him describe Isaiah as having a stern and harsh temperament. Controlled his family with an iron fist. Wife, uh, two sons, adopted daughter...."""
1,19,DEAN,"(Giving SAM a totally blank look) I don't....know. uhh...I'm still waiting for the movie on that one. Anyway, we gotta get back in and see that painting."
1,19,SARAH,Yeah.
1,20,WOMAN,What do you think?
1,20,JOHN. VOICEOVER.,
1,20,END EPISODE,
1,22,Meg,You boys really screwed up this time.
1,22,Dean,Where is he?
1,22,Sam,Meg? (Dean just nods) What’d she say?
1,22,Dean,"I just told you, Sammy. (Dean is clearly upset) Okay. Okay."
1,22,Sam,"What are you doing, Dean?"
1,22,Sam,Why?
1,22,Sam,Good. We’ve still got three bullets left. Let it come.
1,22,Dean,"Listen, tough guy, we’re not ready, okay? We don’t know how many of them are out there. Now, we’re no good to anybody dead. We’re leaving.... now!"
1,22,Sam,"I’m telling you, Dean, we could have taken him."
1,22,Dean,"What we need is a plan. Now, they’re probably keeping Dad alive, we just gotta figure out where. They’re gonna wanna trade him for the gun. (Sam just shakes his head and Dean glances over at him) What?"
1,22,Sam,"Dean, if that were true, why didn’t Meg mention a trade? (getting upset) Dad, he might be...."
1,22,Dean,Don’t!
1,22,Sam,"Look, I don’t want to believe it any more than you. But if he is, all the more reason to kill this damn thing. We still have the Colt. We can still finish the job."
1,22,Dean,"Screw the job, Sam!"
1,22,Sam,"Dean, I’m just trying to do what he would want. He would want us to keep going."
1,22,Dean (angry),"Quit talking about him like he’s dead already. Listen to me, everything stops until we get him back, you understand me? Everything."
1,22,Sam,So how do we find him?
1,22,Dean,Maybe we go to Lincoln. Start at the warehouse where he was taken.
1,22,Sam,"Come on, Dean, you really think these demons are going to leave a trail?"
1,22,Dean (pauses),You’re right. We need help.
1,22,Bobby,Here you go.
1,22,Dean,What is this – holy water?
1,22,Bobby,That one is. (holds out the other flask) This is whiskey.
1,22,Dean,"Bobby, thanks. Thanks for everything. To tell you the truth, I wasn’t sure we should come."
1,22,Bobby,Nonsense. Your Daddy needs help.
1,22,Dean,"Well, yeah, but last time we saw you, I mean, you did threaten to blast him full of buckshot. Cocked the shotgun and everything."
1,22,Bobby,"Yeah, well, what can I say? John just has that effect on people."
1,22,Dean,"Yeah, I guess he does."
1,22,Bobby,None of that matters now. All that matters is that you get him back.
1,22,Sam,"Bobby, this book.... I’ve never seen anything like it."
1,22,Sam,"And these, uh, these protective circles. They really work?"
1,22,Bobby,"Hell, yeah. You get a demon in - they’re trapped. Powerless. It’s like a Satanic roach motel. (Sam chuckles)"
1,22,Bobby,"I’ll tell you something else, too. This is some serious crap you boys stepped in."
1,22,Sam,"Oh, yeah? How’s that?"
1,22,Bobby,"Normal year, I hear of, say, three demonic possessions. Maybe four, tops."
1,22,Dean,Yeah?
1,22,Bobby,This year I hear of 27 so far. You get what I’m saying? More and more demons are walking among us – a lot more.
1,22,Sam,Do you know why?
1,22,Bobby,"No, but I know it’s something big. The storm’s coming, and you boys, your Daddy – you are smack in the middle of it."
1,22,Bobby,Rumsfeld.
1,22,Bobby,Something’s wrong.
1,22,Meg,"No more crap, okay?"
1,22,Meg,"I want the Colt, Sam – the real Colt – right now."
1,22,Sam,We don’t have it on us. We buried it.
1,22,Meg,"Didn’t I say “no more crap”? I swear – after everything I heard about you Winchesters, I got to tell you, I’m a little underwhelmed. First Johnny tries to pawn off a fake gun, and then he leaves the real gun with you two chuckleheads. Lackluster, men. I mean, did you really think I wouldn’t find you?"
1,22,Dean,"Actually, we were counting on it."
1,22,Dean,Gotcha.
1,22,Meg,"You know, if you wanted to tie me up, all you had to do was ask."
1,22,Bobby,I salted the door and windows. If there are any demons out there – they ain’t getting in.
1,22,Dean,"Where’s our father, Meg?"
1,22,Meg,You didn’t ask very nice.
1,22,Dean,"Where’s our father, bitch?"
1,22,Meg,"Jeez. You kiss your mother with that mouth? Oh wait, I forgot, you don’t."
1,22,Dean (yelling),You think this is a frigging game? Where is he?! What did you do to him?
1,22,Meg,He died screaming. I killed him myself.
1,22,Meg,That’s kind of a turn on – you hitting a girl.
1,22,Dean,You’re no girl.
1,22,Sam,You okay?
1,22,Dean,She’s lying. He’s not dead.
1,22,Bobby,"Dean, you got to be careful with her. Don’t hurt her."
1,22,Dean,Why?
1,22,Bobby,"Because she really is a girl, that’s why."
1,22,Sam,What are you talking about?
1,22,Bobby,She’s possessed. That’s a human possessed by a demon. Can’t you tell?
1,22,Dean,Are you trying to tell me there’s an innocent girl trapped somewhere in there?
1,22,Dean,That’s actually good news.
1,22,Meg,Are you gonna read me a story?
1,22,Dean,"Something like that. Hit it, Sam."
1,22,Sam,"Regna terrae, cantate deo, psallite domino....... (he continues in Latin)"
1,22,Dean,"Oh we’re going for it, baby – head spinning, projectile vomiting, the whole nine yards."
1,22,Sam,.... tribuite virtutem deo.
1,22,Meg,I’m gonna to kill you. (she looks at Dean) I’m gonna rip the bones from your body.
1,22,Dean,"No, you’re gonna burn in hell. Unless you tell us where our Dad is. (Meg just smiles at him) Well, at least you’ll get a nice tan. (he glances up at Sam)"
1,22,Sam,"Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica potestas, omnis incuriso infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, onmis congregatio et secta diabolica...."
1,22,Meg,He begged for his life with tears in his eyes. He begged to see his sons one last time. That’s when I slit his throat.
1,22,Sam,Ergo...
1,22,Dean,"For your sake, I hope you’re lying. Cause if it’s true, I swear to God, I will march into hell myself and I will slaughter each and every one of you evil sons of bitches, so help me God!"
1,22,Sam,"Perditionis venenum propinare. Vade, satana, inventor et magister omnis fallaciae. (a winds starts to blow through the room) Hostis humanae salutis. Humiliare sub potenti manu dei. Contremisce et effuge. Invocato a nobis sancto et terribile nomine. Quem inferi tremunt..."
1,22,Dean,Where is he?
1,22,Meg,"You just won’t take “dead” for an answer, will you?"
1,22,Dean,Where is he?!
1,22,Meg,Dead!
1,22,Dean (yelling),"No, he’s not! He’s not dead! He can’t be! (Dean is obviously getting very upset and angry. Sam is looking at him with concern) What are you looking at? Keep reading."
1,22,Sam,"Ab insidis diaboli, libera nos, domine. Ut ecclesiam tuam secura tibi facias, libertate servire, te rogamus, audi nos. (the chair starts to slide around the circle) Ut inimicos sanctae ecclesiae humiliare digneris, to rogamus audi...."
1,22,Meg,He will be!
1,22,Dean,Wait! What?!
1,22,Meg,He’s not dead. But he will be after what we do to him.
1,22,Dean,How do we know you’re telling the truth?
1,22,Meg,You don’t.
1,22,Dean,Sam!
1,22,Meg,A building! Okay? A building in Jefferson City.
1,22,Dean,"Missouri? Where, where? An address!"
1,22,Meg,I don’t know.
1,22,Sam,And the demon – the one we’re looking for - where is it?
1,22,Meg,I don’t know! I swear! That’s everything. That’s all I know.
1,22,Dean,Finish it.
1,22,Meg,What? I told you the truth!
1,22,Dean,I don’t care.
1,22,Meg,"You son of a bitch, you promised."
1,22,Dean,I lied!! Sam? (Sam doesn’t say anything and Dean looks at him) Sam! Read. (Dean walks by him)
1,22,Dean,She doesn’t know.
1,22,Sam,She lied.
1,22,Dean,"Sam, there’s an innocent girl trapped somewhere in there. We’ve go to help her."
1,22,Dean,What?
1,22,Bobby,You said she fell from a building. That girl’s body is broken. The only thing keeping her alive is that demon inside. You exorcise it – that girl is going to die.
1,22,Dean,"Listen to me, both of you, we are not gonna leave her like that."
1,22,Bobby,She is a human being.
1,22,Dean,"And we’re gonna put her out of her misery. Sam, finish it."
1,22,Dean,Finish it.
1,22,Sam,"Dominicos sanctae ecclesiae, terogamus audi nos, terribilis deus do sanctuario suo deus israhel. Ipse tribuite virtutem et fortitudinem plebi suae, benedictus deus, gloria patri...."
1,22,Dean,She’s still alive. (to Bobby) Call 911. Get some water and blankets.
1,22,Meg (whispers),Thank you.
1,22,Sam,"Shh, shh. Just take it easy, alright?"
1,22,Dean,Come on. Let’s get her down.
1,22,Sam,"Sorry, sorry. I got you. I got you. It’s okay. It’s okay."
1,22,Meg (strained),A year.
1,22,Sam,What?
1,22,Meg,It’s been a year.
1,22,Sam,"Shh, just take it easy."
1,22,Meg,I’ve been awake for some of it. I couldn’t move my own body. The things I did – it’s a nightmare.
1,22,Dean,Was it telling us the truth about our Dad?
1,22,Sam,Dean.
1,22,Dean,We need to know.
1,22,Meg,Yes. But it wants... you to know... that... they want you to come for him.
1,22,Dean,"If Dad’s still alive, none of that matters."
1,22,Sam,Where is the demon we’re looking for?
1,22,Meg,Not there. Other ones. Awful ones.
1,22,Dean,Where are they keeping our Dad?
1,22,Meg,By the river. Sunrise.
1,22,Dean,“Sunrise”. What does that mean? What does that mean?
1,22,Bobby,You better hurry up and beat it. Before the paramedics get here.
1,22,Dean,What are you gonna tell them?
1,22,Bobby,You think you guys invented lying to the cops? I’ll figure something out. (he hands the Key of Solomon book to Sam) Here take this. You might need it.
1,22,Sam,Thanks.
1,22,Dean,"Thanks... for everything. Be careful, alright?"
1,22,Bobby,"You just go find your Dad. And when you do, you bring him around, would you? I won’t even try to shoot him this time."
1,22,Sam,You’ve been quiet.
1,22,Dean,Just getting ready.
1,22,Sam,"He’s gonna be fine, Dean."
1,22,Dean,"Dude, what are you drawing on my car!"
1,22,Sam,It’s called a Devil’s trap. Demons can’t get through it or inside it.
1,22,Dean,So?
1,22,Dean,So?
1,22,Sam,"So, we have a place to hide the Colt while we go get Dad."
1,22,Dean,What are you talking about? We’re bringing the Colt with us.
1,22,Sam,"We can’t, Dean. We’ve only got three bullets left. We can’t just use them on any demon, we’ve got to use them on the demon."
1,22,Dean,"No, we have to save Dad, Sam, okay? We’re gonna need all the help we can get."
1,22,Sam,"Dean, you know how pissed Dad would be if we used all the bullets? Dean, he wouldn’t want us to bring the gun."
1,22,Dean,"I don’t care, Sam. I don’t care what Dad wants, okay? And since when do you care what Dad wants?"
1,22,Sam,"We want to kill this demon. You used to want that, too. Hell, I mean, you’re the one who came and got me at school! (Dean scoffs) You’re the one who dragged me back into this, Dean. I’m just trying to finish it!"
1,22,Dean,"Well, you and Dad are a lot more alike than I thought, you know that? You both can’t wait to sacrifice yourself for this thing. But you know what? I’m gonna be the one to bury you. You’re selfish, you know that? You don’t care about anything but revenge."
1,22,Sam,"That’s not true, Dean. (Dean scoffs) I want Dad back. But they are expecting us to bring this gun. They get the gun, they will kill us all. That Colt is our only leverage and you know it, Dean. We can not bring that gun. We can’t."
1,22,Dean,Fine.
1,22,Sam,"I’m serious, Dean."
1,22,Dean,"I said fine, Sam."
1,22,Dean,"Hey, hey. (Sam stops and looks at him) Think I know what Meg meant by Sunrise."
1,22,Dean,"Son of a bitch. That’s pretty smart. I mean, if these demons can possess people they can possess almost anybody inside."
1,22,Sam,"Yeah, and make anybody attack us."
1,22,Dean,And so we can’t kill them – a building full of human shields.
1,22,Sam,"They probably know exactly what we look like, too. And they could look like anybody."
1,22,Dean,"Yeah, this sucks out loud."
1,22,Sam,"Tell me about it. Alright, so, how the hell are we going to get in?"
1,22,Dean,"Pull the fire alarm, get out all the civilians."
1,22,Sam,"Okay, but then the city responds in, what, seven minutes?"
1,22,Dean,Seven minutes exactly.
1,22,Dean,"Hey, what’s happening? Is it a fire?"
1,22,Fireman,"We’re figuring that out right now, sir. Just stay back. (the fireman moves Dean away)"
1,22,Dean,"Well, I’ve got a Yorkie upstairs and he pees when he’s nervous...."
1,22,Fireman,"Sir, you have to stay back."
1,22,Dean,I always wanted to be a fireman when I grew up.
1,22,Sam,You never told me that.
1,22,Dean,This is the fire department. We need you to evacuate.
1,22,Dean,Come on!
1,22,Dean,Hurry up!
1,22,Dean,"Dad? (he leans down and listens) He’s still breathing. (Sam looks relieved. Dean starts shaking John) Dad, wake up. Dad!"
1,22,Sam,Wait. Wait.
1,22,Dean,What?
1,22,Sam,He could be possessed for all we know.
1,22,Dean,"What, are you nuts?"
1,22,Sam,"Dean, we got to be sure."
1,22,John,Sam? Why are you splashing water on me?
1,22,Dean,"Dad, are you okay?"
1,22,John,They’ve been drugging me. Where’s the Colt?
1,22,Sam,"Don’t worry, Dad, it’s safe."
1,22,John,Good boys. Good boys.
1,22,Fireman,"Hey, buddy, you can’t go in."
1,22,Sam,Go! Go!
1,22,Dean,Back! Back!
1,22,Dean,"Sam, let’s go!"
1,22,Dean,Sam!
1,22,Dean,"Sam! (he picks him up) Sam, come on! Come on!"
1,22,Dean,Come on. We got to get out of here.
1,22,Sam,How is he?
1,22,Dean,"He just needed a little rest, that’s all. How are you?"
1,22,Sam,"I’ll survive. (he turns to his brother) Hey, you don’t think we were followed here, do you?"
1,22,Dean,"I don’t know. I don’t think so. I mean, we couldn’t have found a more out-of-the-way place to hole up."
1,22,Sam,"Yeah. (he looks at his brother) Hey, uh.... Dean, you, um...... you saved my life back there."
1,22,Dean,"So, I guess you’re glad I brought the gun, huh?"
1,22,Sam,"Man, I’m trying to thank you here."
1,22,Dean,You’re welcome.
1,22,Dean,"Hey, Sam?"
1,22,Sam,Yeah?
1,22,Dean,You know that guy I shot? There was a person in there.
1,22,Sam,"You didn’t have a choice, Dean."
1,22,Dean,"Yeah, I know, that’s not what bothers me."
1,22,Sam,Then what does?
1,22,Dean,"Killing that guy, killing Meg. I didn’t hesitate, I didn’t even flinch. For you or Dad, the things I’m willing to do or kill, it’s just, uh .... it scares me sometimes."
1,22,John,It shouldn’t. You did good.
1,22,Dean,You’re not mad?
1,22,John,For what?
1,22,Dean,Using a bullet.
1,22,John,"Mad? I’m proud of you. You know, Sam and I, we can get pretty obsessed. But you – you watch out for this family. You always have."
1,22,Dean,Thanks.
1,22,John,It found us. It’s here.
1,22,Sam,The demon?
1,22,John,"Sam, lines of salt in front of every window, every door."
1,22,Sam,I already did it.
1,22,John,"Well, check it, okay?"
1,22,Sam,Okay. (he leaves the room)
1,22,John,"Dean, you got the gun?"
1,22,Dean,Yeah.
1,22,John,Give it to me.
1,22,John,"This is me. I won’t miss. Now, the gun, hurry."
1,22,John,"Son, please."
1,22,John,"Give me the gun. What are you doing, Dean?"
1,22,Dean,He’d be furious.
1,22,John,What?
1,22,Dean,"That I wasted a bullet. He wouldn’t be proud of me, he’d tear me a new one."
1,22,Dean,You’re not my Dad.
1,22,John,"Dean, it’s me."
1,22,Dean,I know my Dad better than anyone. And you ain’t him.
1,22,John,What the hell’s gotten into you?
1,22,Dean,I could ask you the same thing. Stay back.
1,22,Sam,Dean? What the hell’s going on?
1,22,John,Your brother’s lost his mind.
1,22,Dean,He’s not Dad.
1,22,Sam,What?
1,22,Dean,I think he’s possessed. I think he’s been possessed since we rescued him. (He starts to get upset.)
1,22,John,"Don’t listen to him, Sammy."
1,22,Sam,"Dean, how do you know?"
1,22,John,"You know, we don’t have time for this. Sam, you wanna kill this demon, you’ve gotta trust me."
1,22,John,Sam?
1,22,Sam,No. No. (He moves over to stand by his brother’s side.)
1,22,John,"Fine. You’re both so sure, go ahead. Kill me."
1,22,John,I thought so.
1,22,John,What a pain in the ass this thing’s been.
1,22,Sam,"It’s you, isn’t it? We’ve been looking for you for a long time."
1,22,John,"Well, you found me."
1,22,Sam,But the holy water?
1,22,John,You think something like that works on something like me?
1,22,Sam,I’m gonna kill you!
1,22,John,"Oh, that’d be a neat trick. In fact, (he puts the gun down on a table) here. Make the gun float to you there, psychic boy."
1,22,John,"Well, this is fun. (he walks over to the window beside Dean) I could’ve killed you a hundred times today, but this...... (sighs) this is worth the wait."
1,22,John,"Your Dad – he’s in here with me. Trapped inside his own meat suit. He says “hi”, by the way. He’s gonna tear you apart. He’s gonna taste the iron in your blood."
1,22,Dean,"Let him go, or I swear to God –"
1,22,John,"What? What are you and God gonna do? You see, as far as I’m concerned, this is justice. (he comes over to Dean) You know that little exorcism of yours? That was my daughter."
1,22,Dean,"Who, Meg?"
1,22,John,The one in the alley? That was my boy. You understand.
1,22,Dean,You’ve got to be kidding me.
1,22,John,"What? You’re the only one that can have a family? You destroyed my children. How would you feel if I killed your family? (he smiles at Dean) Oh, that’s right. I forgot. I did. Still, two wrongs don’t make a right."
1,22,Dean,You son of a bitch.
1,22,Sam,I wanna know why. Why’d you do it?
1,22,Sam,Yeah.
1,22,Sam,In the way of what?
1,22,John,"My plans for you, Sammy. You... and all the children like you."
1,22,Dean,"Listen, you mind just getting this over with, huh? Cause I really can’t stand the monologuing."
1,22,Dean,"Oh, yeah? What’s that?"
1,22,John,"You know, you fight and you fight for this family, but the truth is they don’t need you. Not like you need them. Sam – he’s clearly John’s favorite. Even when they fight, it’s more concern than he’s ever shown you."
1,22,Dean,"I bet you’re real proud of your kids, too, huh? Oh wait, I forgot. I wasted ‘em."
1,22,Sam,Dean! No!
1,22,Dean,"Dad! Dad, don’t you let it kill me!"
1,22,Sam,Dean!! No!!
1,22,Dean,"Dad, please."
1,22,Sam,Dean!!
1,22,John (whispers),Stop. (Sam is suddenly let go) Stop it.
1,22,John,"You kill me, you kill Daddy."
1,22,Sam,I know.
1,22,Sam,"Dean? Dean, hey? Oh God, you’ve lost a lot of blood."
1,22,Dean,Where’s Dad?
1,22,Sam,"He’s right here. He’s right here, Dean."
1,22,Dean,Go check on him.
1,22,Sam,Dean.
1,22,Dean,Go check on him.
1,22,Sam,Dad? Dad?
1,22,Dean,"Sam, don’t you do it. Don’t you do it."
1,22,John,"You’ve gotta hurry! I can’t hold onto it much longer! You shoot me, son! Shoot me! Son, I’m begging you! We can end this here and now! Sammy!"
1,22,Dean,"Sam, no."
1,22,John,You do this! Sammy!! Sam.....
1,22,Sam,"Look, just hold on, alright. The hospital’s only ten minutes away."
1,22,John,"I’m surprised at you, Sammy. Why didn’t you kill it? I thought we saw eye-to-eye on this? Killing this demon comes first – before me, before everything."
1,22,Sam,"No, sir. Not before everything. Look, we’ve still got the Colt. We still have the one bullet left. We just have to start over, alright? I mean, we already found the demon....."

10,5,MARIE ,"I mean, it's close, but it's just.... It needs a little more grrrr !"
10,5,SAM ,Hey ! How long have you been up ?
10,5,DEAN ,Long enough to find us a case.
10,5,SAM ,Long enough to... I take it that means you're feeling back to normal ?
10,5,DEAN ,"Yeah, whatever normal is in our world. So, huh, right here. (He takes a newspaper to show it to Sam.) A teacher in an all girls school went missing in Flint, Michigan. She was heading to her car, disappeared, and nobody's seen her since."
10,5,SAM ,"Dean, there's nothing here that even remotely suggest there is a case."
10,5,DEAN ,There is nothing that even remotely suggest there isn't a case. Boom !
10,5,SAM ,"Come on, man."
10,5,DEAN ,"Sam ! Out there, hunting. It's the only normal I know. (They look at each other, then Dean puts his rifle in Baby's trunk.) We got work to do. (He closes the trunk.)"
10,5,SAM ,"Yeah, of course ! Yeah, I certainly appreciate it. You got it. Thanks, officer. (He hangs up, then, they get out of the car.) So, the last place Ms. Chandler was seen by anyone was in the auditorium. Turns out she's the drama teacher."
10,5,DEAN ,"Ugh, theater kids. Great"
10,5,SAM ,What ? I was a theater kid.
10,5,DEAN ,"Barely. You did Our Town, which was cool. But then, you did that crappy musical."
10,5,SAM ,The - Oklahoma ? Hugh Jackman got cast off of Oklahoma.
10,5,DEAN ,"You ran tech, Wolverine."
10,5,SAM ,Shut up.
10,5,SALAZAR ,"If you gentlemen need anything else, let me know."
10,5,SAM ,"Great. Thanks, Ms. Salazar."
10,5,ACTRESS!BOBBY ,"You, idjits! You, idjits. You are idjits."
10,5,KRISTEN!CASTIEL ,"Hey, ass-butt ! Hey ! Ass-butt !"
10,5,SIOBHAN!DEAN ,"John and Mary, husband and wife"
10,5,MARIE ,Cut !
10,5,DEAN ,What in the holy....
10,5,SAM ,If there is case... It probably has something to do with all of this.
10,5,DEAN ,You think ?
10,5,MAEVE ,Publisher ?
10,5,SIOBHAN ,Maggie ! Marie just never stops !
10,5,MAGGIE ,I know. You were great.
10,5,MARIE ,"Hi ! Oh my gosh... Are you guys from the publisher ? I'm Marie, writer slash director. This is Maeve, my stage manager, and I was just, uh, dir-"
10,5,SAM ,"I'm special agent Smith. This is my partner, special agent -"
10,5,DEAN ,Smith.
10,5,SAM ,Smith. No relation. We're here to look into the disappearance-
10,5,DEAN ,There is no singing in Supernatural !
10,5,MAEVE ,"Well, this is Marie's interpretation..."
10,5,DEAN ,"Hah ! Well... I mean, if there was singing, you know... And that's a big if ! If there was singing, it would be classic rock. Not this Andrew Floyd Webber crap -"
10,5,SAM ,(whispering) Andrew Lloyd Webber.
10,5,DEAN ,What ?
10,5,MARIE ,"Well ! You know, we do sing a cover of Carry On Wayward Son, in the second act."
10,5,DEAN ,Oh !
10,5,SAM ,Really ?
10,5,SAM ,"Right. Anyways. We're here to talk about the disappearance of Ms. Chandler. Any chance you two saw her, before she vanished ?"
10,5,MARIE ,"Hum, yeah. She left around, like, what ? 9.30 ?"
10,5,SAM ,Any idea where she would be headed at that time of night ?
10,5,MAEVE ,A bar ? Or a liquor store ? Both ?
10,5,SAM ,Wow. Really ?
10,5,MARIE ,"She had a nasty divorce, last year. Most of the time, she's sipping on her, uh, grown-up juice, or passed out. Usually, in that order."
10,5,DEAN ,"Yeah, well, I don't blame her. I'm gonna need fifty Jell-O shots and a hose down to get this stink off of me."
10,5,SAM ,"Maeve, right ? You're the stage manager ?"
10,5,MAEVE ,And I understudy Jody Mills.
10,5,DEAN ,What ?
10,5,SAM ,"That's great ! That's great. Jody Mills, that's great. So ! How about you give a... behind the scenes tour, while your director show my partner Ms. Chandler's office ? Deal ? (The girls nod.) Great. Give us a moment, please."
10,5,MARIE ,Ok.
10,5,DEAN ,I'm gonna throw up.
10,5,SAM ,"I mean, I gotta say, it's kind of charming. The production value, and the... No ? (Seeing his brother's look). No, no. I'm gonna check for EMF. You look for... cursed objects."
10,5,DEAN ,How did you get all this stuff ?
10,5,MARIE ,"Some parts homemade, some parts repurposed. All of it, awesome- (Dean can't help himself and tries the fake rifle. Marie runs to him and takes the rifle from his hands.) Don't. Please, don't."
10,5,DEAN ,What are they doing ?
10,5,MARIE ,"Oh ! Hum, they're rehearsing the B.M. scene."
10,5,DEAN ,The bowel movement scene ?
10,5,MARIE ,"No ! The boy melodrama scene ! (Dean looks confused.) You know, the scene where the boys get together, and they're-they're driving, or leaning against Baby. Drinking a beer, sharing their feelings. (The Americana theme is playing, while Dean is looking at the B.M. scene.) The two of them. Alone. But together. Bonded. United. The power of the brotherly-"
10,5,DEAN ,Why are they standing so close together ?
10,5,MARIE ,Hum... Reasons.
10,5,DEAN ,"You know they're brothers, right ?"
10,5,MARIE ,"Well, duh ! But... Subtext."
10,5,DEAN ,"Why don't you take some substeps back there, ladies ?"
10,5,SAM ,"Now, have you noticed anything strange during the production ? I mean, any odd noises, or, huh-"
10,5,MAEVE ,"You mean, something like this ? (She pushes a button, we hear a scream.) Or perhaps, this ? (Another button, another weird voice.)"
10,5,SAM ,Right. Of course.
10,5,MAEVE ,How about this ?
10,5,SAM ,"I-I got it. Thanks. You know, back when I did tech in school, we had two CD decks-"
10,5,MAEVE ,"I'm sorry, I have to go sign the delivery. Please, don't touch anything."
10,5,SAM ,Sorry !
10,5,DEAN ,Is this hers ?
10,5,MARIE ,"No ! That's a prop from act two ! I've been looking for that, actually."
10,5,DEAN ,There's no space in Supernatural.
10,5,MARIE ,"Well, not canonically, no. But this is transformative fiction."
10,5,DEAN ,(smirks) You mean fan fiction.
10,5,MARIE ,"Call it whatever you like, ok ? It's inspired by Carver Edlund's books. With a few embellishments. But, as you know, Chuck stopped writing after Swan Song. I just- I couldn't leave it the way that it was ! I mean, Dean not hunting anymore, living with Lisa ?! Sam, somehow back from Hell, but not with Dean ?! So, I wrote my own ending."
10,5,DEAN ,You wrote your own ending. With spaceships ?
10,5,MARIE ,"And robots. And some ninjas. And then, Dean becomes a woman. (Dean stares at her.) It's just for a few scenes !"
10,5,DEAN ,"Alright, Shakespeare ! You know that I can actually tell you what really happened with the-the Sam and Dean ? A friend of mine hooked me up with the, uh, unpublished unpublished books. So, Sam came back from Hell. But without a soul. Then, Cas brought in a bunch of leviathans from Purgatory. They lost Bobby. And then, Cas and Dean got stuck in Purgatory, Sam hit a dog. They met a prophet named Kevin, they lost him too. Then Sam endured a series of trials, in an attempt to close the gates of Hell. Which nearly cost him his life. Then Dean? Dean became a demon. Knight of Hell, actually."
10,5,MARIE ,Wow...
10,5,DEAN ,Yep.
10,5,MARIE ,"That is some of the worst fan fiction that I've ever heard ! I mean, seriously, I don't know where your friend found this garbage ! I am not saying that ours is masterpiece, or anything, but geez ! Ha ! I'll have to send you some fic links later."
10,5,DEAN ,What are they doing ?
10,5,MARIE ,"Hum... Kids, these days, call it hugging."
10,5,DEAN ,Is that in the show ?
10,5,MARIE ,"Oh, no. Siobhan and Kristen are a couple in real life. Although, we do explore the nature of Destiel in act two."
10,5,DEAN ,"Sorry, what ?"
10,5,MARIE ,"Oh, it's just subtext ! But, then again, you know, you can't spell subtext without.... s-e-x."
10,5,SAM ,I don't understand.
10,5,DEAN ,Me neither.
10,5,SAM ,"I mean, shouldn't it be... Deastiel ?"
10,5,DEAN ,Really ? That's your issue with this ?
10,5,SAM ,"(smirks) No, of course it's not my issue. You know... How about Sastiel ? Samstiel ?"
10,5,DEAN ,"Ok, alright. You know what ? You're gonna do that thing, where you just shut the hell up. Forever."
10,5,SAM ,"Look, man. No EMF. No hexbags. None of the props are even remotely hincky. Other than the Charlie Kaufman of it all, I got nothing. You ?"
10,5,DEAN ,"In Ms. Chandler's office, there's just a pile of empty bottles and regret. She's just probably face down in a bar, somewhere. Or a ditch. Alright, so what ? This-this all... This whole musical thing, everything, it's... It's all a coincidence ? There is no case ?"
10,5,SAM ,"Unless you're seeing something I'm not, no, Dean. There's no case, here."
10,5,DEAN ,Ok.
10,5,SAM ,CasDean ?
10,5,DEAN ,Shut your face ! Get in the car !
10,5,MARIE ,"Maggie ! Come on ! Please, don't do this !"
10,5,MAGGIE ,"Everyone else is willing to follow your little dictatorship. But not me. I've been telling you all along, Marie. If it's not canon, then it shouldn't be in the show. You know, we should've done The Outsiders, like I told you."
10,5,MARIE ,Just... Come back inside ! We can make this work !
10,5,MAGGIE ,I'm going to principal Salazar's in the morning. Gonna do what Ms. Chandler was too drunk to finish.
10,5,MARIE ,Maggie ? Maggie !
10,5,DEAN ,"So, I checked with the principal. There's nothing on the surveillance tapes. What the -what the cops think ?"
10,5,SAM ,"You know, the only clue they found was by the dumpster. They found the same flower, near Ms. Chandler's cell phone. (Sam show the flower to Dean.) You recognize it ?"
10,5,DEAN ,No.
10,5,SAM ,"Yeah, me neither."
10,5,SAM ,Hey.
10,5,MARIE ,Let me guess. You guys came here to laugh at me too. Right ?
10,5,SAM ,Why don't you tell us what happened to your friend ?
10,5,MARIE ,"Maggie quit the show. She was trying to get it shut down, so, we were fighting. Then, she-she left, and I heard her scream. So, I ran outside to help. And... And I saw a scarecrow. It looked just like the one from our show. But... Alive."
10,5,DEAN ,"Then, what ?"
10,5,MARIE ,"It wrapped her in vines, and took her behind the dumpster. And then, there were both just... gone. So, I called the cops, and a bunch of adults just told me, I have an overactive imagination. But, it's all real. Ghosts. Angels. Demons."
10,5,MAEVE ,I wanna believe.
10,5,SAM ,"You should believe. You both should. Cause, it is all real. And so are we. I'm Sam Winchester. That's Dean."
10,5,MARIE ,"Ok ! Now, look. I'm willing to accept that monsters are real. But those books are works of fiction."
10,5,MAEVE ,"And you guys are way too old to be Sam, or Dean."
10,5,MARIE ,"Oh, yeah !"
10,5,MAEVE ,More of a Bobby/Rufus combo ? Maybe.
10,5,DEAN ,Ok. Alright. Little miss sunshine. We are what the books called hunters.
10,5,MAEVE ,FBI hunters ?
10,5,DEAN ,Yeah.
10,5,MAEVE ,You guys are X-Files.
10,5,SAM ,"Sure. Yeah, you can say that. So, this scarecrow, from your musical, is it based on the one from the books ?"
10,5,MARIE ,"No, I changed it. I got scared of a local legend, when I was a kid. There was this old creepy scarecrow, on an abandoned farm, oustide of town. Kids used to say, if it caught you, it would take you away."
10,5,DEAN ,"Ok. If this scarecrow is based over your version, then Ms. Chandler and Maggie might still be alive."
10,5,MAEVE ,You think the scarecrow was created by the play ?
10,5,MARIE ,You think... It's a tulpa !
10,5,SAM ,"Tulpas are monsters that are created by an intense, focused energy on an idea, or-"
10,5,MARIE ,Or a story.
10,5,MAEVE ,Great. How do you kill an idea ?
10,5,MARIE ,"Well, in Hell House, Sam and Dean burnt the house down, to take out the one tulpa they hunted."
10,5,DEAN ,"Yeah, yeah, you kill the symbol, you kill the tulpa. It's a- actually, a pretty good start. So, the scarecrow on your play. Is it a person, or a prop ?"
10,5,MARIE ,Prop. And it's terrifying. We keep it in the boiler room.
10,5,SAM ,"That's, uh, great. Hum... Can you guys read up ? Just, give us a sec'. (Sam and Dean goes away to have a conversation.) Fine, so, this doesn't add up. Tulpas require a ton of psychic energy to juice up."
10,5,DEAN ,Yeah.
10,5,SAM ,"Well, it's not like the Supernatural books are tearing up the New York Times best-seller list. And I seriously doubt this play has even sold out."
10,5,DEAN ,I hope not.
10,5,SAM ,"Well, but, you know what ? This flower. I know I've seen it in the lore, somewhere. There's gotta be a connection."
10,5,DEAN ,"Alright. You get on that, I'm gonna take a shot at burning man."
10,5,SAM ,Yeah.
10,5,DEAN ,Yeah.
10,5,DEAN ,Can you show me to the boiler room ?
10,5,MARIE ,Yeah... Sure.
10,5,MARIE ,Gird your loins. It's horrifying.
10,5,DEAN ,Really ?
10,5,MARIE ,"I know. Scary, right ?"
10,5,DEAN ,You wanna pinata this asshat ?
10,5,MARIE ,"Asshat ? Nice ! It's, uh, very Dean. No. He's all yours, agent Smith."
10,5,MARIE ,Thank you !
10,5,DEAN ,We came ! We saw ! We kicked-
10,5,SAM ,It's not a tulpa.
10,5,DEAN ,What ?
10,5,SAM ,It's not a tulpa.
10,5,DEAN ,"Say it one more time, but just a little bit more Arnold, like - it's not a tulpa."
10,5,SAM ,"Dude, come on. It's Calliope."
10,5,DEAN ,Who ?
10,5,MAEVE ,The goddess of epic poetry ? The muse.
10,5,SAM,"She's associated with this - the borage, or starflower. That's the picture."
10,5,DEAN ,"Ok, wait. If this is a god thing, then what's with the scarecrow ?"
10,5,SAM ,"According to the lore, Calliope manifests creatures from the story she's tuned into."
10,5,MARIE ,"So... The scarecrow is still alive, and we burned my prop for nothing ?"
10,5,DEAN ,"Oh, that thing needed to burn."
10,5,MAEVE ,The only way to destroy the scarecrow is to kill Calliope.
10,5,SAM ,"Right. She uses these manifestations, like the scarecrow, to inspire the author, and protect them, until their vision has realized."
10,5,DEAN ,"Then, what ?"
10,5,SAM ,"Then, she eats the author."
10,5,MARIE ,"Ok, that's bad ! Um... Well ! You get your wish. Let's cancel the show."
10,5,SAM ,"That's what your teacher and your classmate did. They tried to shut you down, and the scarecrow took them. Protecting you, and the show."
10,5,DEAN ,"Ok, so, the scarecrow is the boogeyman. We got to take our shot with this, uh..."
10,5,SAM ,Calliope.
10,5,DEAN ,Calliope. But she won't show herself until - your vision has realized.
10,5,MARIE ,So... What are you saying ?
10,5,DEAN ,The show must go on.
10,5,DEAN ,Hey ! Why don't you-
10,5,SAM ,"Why don't you guys rally Marie ? I'm gonna, uh, grab some wooden stakes in the trunk, an do the blessing."
10,5,MAEVE ,Is Marie gonna get eaten ?
10,5,DEAN ,"Not gonna happen. Soon as that curtain rises, we're gonna be there to take out this Calliope. (He goes check on Marie.) Hey ! Hey. How are you doing, champ ?"
10,5,MARIE ,"This... This is all my fault. If I hadn't written this dumb play, none of this would've happened."
10,5,DEAN ,"Ok. First of all, the play is not dumb."
10,5,MAEVE ,I thought you didn't believe in this interpretation ?
10,5,DEAN ,"Yeah, I don't. Look, like, at all. But you do. Ok ? And I need you to believe in it with all you got. So that we can kill Calliope, and we can save your friends. Can you do that ?"
10,5,MARIE ,"Yeah. You're right. If Sam and Dean were real, they wouldn't back down from a fight. Especially my sweet, brave, selfless Sam. There's nothing he can't do."
10,5,DEAN ,No...
10,5,MARIE ,"Ok. Let's do this. I understudy Sam, so... (She grabs a wig.) I used this for my one-woman Orphan Black show, last year. But it's gonna have to work for Sam. (She puts the wig on her head.) Writer. Director. Actor. I'm gonna Barbra Streisand this bitch."
10,5,DEAN ,The... samulet ?
10,5,MARIE ,That amulet is a symbol of the Winchesters' brotherly love.
10,5,SAM ,Hey.
10,5,DEAN ,Ok.
10,5,SAM ,Pretty good ! Wait a second... Where's Chuck ?
10,5,MARIE ,"Oh ! I-I, I love him. I do ! But honestly, the whole author introducting himself into the narrative thing, it's just not my favorite. I kind of hate the meta stories."
10,5,DEAN ,"Alright, listen up, girls. Now, you're all here, because you love Supernatural."
10,5,ACTRESS!MARY ,"Actually, I was hoping we'd do Wicked."
10,5,DEAN ,"Yeah, that'd have been easier. I know I have expressed some differences of opinion, regarding this particular version of Supernatural. But tonight, it is all about Marie's vision. This is Marie's Supernatural. So, I want you to get out there, and I want you to stand as close as she wants you to, and I want you to put as much sub and add text, as you possibly can. There is no other road. No other way. No day, but today."
10,5,MAEVE ,Did he just quote Rent ?
10,5,MARIE ,Not enough to get us in trouble.
10,5,DEAN ,"Now, you get out there, and you kick it in the ass !"
10,5,KRISTEN!CASTIEL ,Alright !
10,5,MARIE ,Bring it in !
10,5,EVERYONE ,Ghooooost-facerssss !
10,5,MARIE ,"Good evening, everybody ! Welcome to our production of Supernatural. I'm not gonna lie. It might be a full on Gallagher show opening up this piece. Uh, so, those of you in the front rows may want to use the ponchos we provided for you, under your seats. You may, in fact, get wet on this ride. (While she talks, Sam gives some ok signs to Dean.) Um, I would like to thank the, uh, cast and crew-"
10,5,DEAN ,"Ok. She's stalling, let's do this."
10,5,MAEVE ,"Copy that. Curtain, kids. It's show time."
10,5,MARIE ,"Ok, um... And-and, that, concludes our introduction for the night. So, everybody just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show."
10,5,MAEVE ,"Everyone, in places ?"
10,5,SIOBHAN!DEAN ,"John and Mary, husband and wife,"
10,5,SIOBHAN!DEAN ,The demon's visits had begun
10,5,SIOBHAN!DEAN ,Leaving us in tears
10,5,DEAN ,Turn around !
10,5,SIOBHAN!DEAN ,On the road so far
10,5,SIOBHAN!DEAN ,"So, that's where we are"
10,5,MAGGIE ,Agent Smith?
10,5,SAM ,Where the hell are we?
10,5,MAGGIE ,School's basement. The scarecrow brought us down here.
10,5,MS. CHANDLER ,"Yeah, I tried that days ago."
10,5,SAM ,So what ? We're stuck in here ?
10,5,CALLIOPE ,That's right. You're gonna miss the big show.
10,5,SIOBHAN!DEAN ,"Ok. So, you can pop in tomorrow morning."
10,5,KRISTEN!CASTIEL ,"Yes. I'll just-wait here, then."
10,5,MARIE ,What do we do now ?
10,5,DEAN ,"Just, stick to the plan, ok ? Keep singing, until the scarecrow comes for you."
10,5,KRISTEN!CASTIEL ,"I'll just wait here, then"
10,5,CALLIOPE ,"I've consumed many authors. Many stories. But tonight, soon as that curtain opened, I knew something special was brewing with this one. Maybe it's because the story's actual inspiration's here. I don't know. I guess I'm gonna have to kill you and your brother to find out."
10,5,SAM ,"Don't you have to wait, until the vision has been realized ?"
10,5,CALLIOPE ,"(smirks) Oh, gods ! If I have to sit through that second act, one more time... There's robots, and tentacles, and space. I can't even."
10,5,MARIE!SAM ,A single man tear's slipped on his face
10,5,SIOBHAN!DEAN ,"A single man tear, that's all I'll spare"
10,5,MAEVE ,"Ok ! We're through the looking glass, here, people. Strike the wendigo set, let's prep the priests costumes. And Sarah ? Get understudies into hair and makeup."
10,5,SAM ,"So, why this story, huh ? Why, uh, Supernatural ?"
10,5,CALLIOPE ,"Supernatural has everything. Life. Death. Ressurection. Redemption. But above all, family. All set to music you can really tap your toe to. It isn't some meandering piece of genre dreck. It's... epic !"
10,5,SIOBHAN!DEAN ,But underneath this broken mask
10,5,CALLIOPE ,And that.... Well ! That is my bag of tea.
10,5,MAGGIE ,Bag this !
10,5,MARIE ,No chick flick moments !
10,5,DEAN ,"Take a bow, Sammy."
10,5,MAEVE ,"Usually, this is when Sam and Dean take off, before anyone asks any questions."
10,5,SAM ,That's probably a good idea.
10,5,MAEVE ,Thanks for saving my friends.
10,5,SAM ,Sure.
10,5,MAEVE ,"You know ? If you'd cut your hair a little, you'd make a pretty good Dean."
10,5,SAM ,Thanks.
10,5,DEAN ,"Well, you did good out there, kid."
10,5,MARIE ,"Hmm, you're not so bad yourself."
10,5,DEAN ,"You know ? This has been educational. Seeing the story from your perspective. You keep writing, Shakespeare."
10,5,MARIE ,Even if it doesn't match how you see it ?
10,5,DEAN ,"I have my version, and you have yours."
10,5,MAEVE ,"One minute, folks. One minute."
10,5,DEAN ,Ok.
10,5,MARIE ,"And, Dean ? You never should've thrown this away."
10,5,DEAN ,"It never really worked. And, I don't need a symbol to remind me how I feel about my brother, so..."
10,5,MARIE ,Just take it. Jerk.
10,5,DEAN ,"Bitch. (He quickly realizes that's not Sam he's talking to, and tries to say something, but can't find the right words. Marie doesn't seem to mind as she laughs at his awkward reaction.) Right. Ok. (While they're getting ready to play a new scene on stage, Dean comes back next to Sam.) Well, I guess we can go back at staring at motel room walls."
10,5,SAM ,"You know what, Dean ? You were right. Staying cooped up isn't helping us. We need-"
10,5,MARIE!SAM ,"We need to get back on the road, Dean. Doing what we do best."
10,5,SAM ,What is that ?
10,5,SIOBHAN!DEAN ,It's just... I don't know anymore.
10,5,DEAN ,"It's the, uh... The B.M. scene."
10,5,MARIE!SAM ,"Saving people, hunting things. You know ? The family business."
10,5,SAM ,The... bowel movement scene ?
10,5,DEAN ,No ! Just... Shh !
10,5,SIOBHAN!DEAN ,"You're right, Sammy. Out on the road. Just the two of us."
10,5,MARIE!SAM ,The two of us against the world.
10,5,SAM ,What she said.
10,5,ACTRESS!MARY ,Carry on my wayward son
10,5,ACTRESS!JOHN ,Lay your weary head to rest
10,5,TOGETHER ,Once I rose above the noise and confusion
10,5,SAM ,Who's that ?
10,5,MAEVE ,"Oh, that's Adam. John Winchester's other kid."
10,5,TOGETHER ,But I flew too high
10,5,MAEVE ,"He's still trapped in the cage, in Hell. With Lucifer."
10,5,TOGETHER ,Masquerading as a man with the reason
10,5,MARIE ,"Oh ! Bye ! Sorry, thank you !"
10,5,MAEVE ,The ticket you left for the publisher ? Someone claimed it !
10,5,MARIE ,Oh my gosh ! But wait... That means that- Calliope came for me or for- ?
10,5,MAEVE ,"Who cares ? Go, fangirl !"
10,5,MARIE ,"Hum... Hi ! Thank you... so much for coming ! Uh... I know the second act is a little bit wonky, and the first act has some issues, but.... What did you think ?"
10,5,CHUCK ,Not bad.
10,5,MARIE smiles.,

10,7,About,Rolling through (can’t see if this says anything more)
10,8,JODY,(sighs) You can get through this.
10,8,JODY,(addressing a young girl who appears homeless) How old are you?
10,8,HOMELESS GIRL,19.
10,8,JODY,(hands her some money) Get yourself some lunch.
10,8,DONNA,Thanks a lot for coming.  Yup.  Thanks.  Here ya go.  Have fun!
10,8,DONNA,"(addressing Jody) Hi!  Hiya. Yah, welcome.  Come on.  Sheriff...  Sheriff Jody Mills, Sioux Falls. Okay.  I'm Sheriff Donna Hanscum.  I work out of Stillwater, but I grew up here, so you have any questions – you know, best burgers, cheapest gas – just ask."
10,8,JODY,I left a kid back in Sioux Falls.  Plus a pile of work.  But when the mayor insists you go –
10,8,DONNA,"(interrupting) You gotta go, yeah. Yah, yah yah, I hear yah.  Here.  Have a sucker."
10,8,JODY,"No, thank you.  (after a pause in which DONNA continues to hold out the sucker) O-okay."
10,8,DOUG,Donna.
10,8,DONNA,Doug.
10,8,DOUG,"Well, aren't you looking good, huh?"
10,8,DONNA,I lost 6 pounds.
10,8,DOUG,Hey! You're a quarter of the way there!
10,8,DOUG,"Hey, you, uh – you think you could toss me a couple extra meal vouchers?  I mean, since you won't be using them?  (After Donna hands him the meal vouchers) Oh.  You are true blue as ever, Donna, huh?"
10,8,DONNA,Doug and I used to be married.
10,8,JODY,Got it.
10,8,DONNA,"Have fun, yah."
10,8,SAM,Hey.  We good?
10,8,Dean,"Aces. (After a pause) Yeah, I love the smell of parchment in the morning."
10,8,SAM,"I mean, how much lore is even left?  We've got nothing on the Mark?"
10,8,LEN,"Uh, good morning.  Uh, excuse me. If I could get you all seated, please.  Uh, good morning."
10,8,AUDIENCE,Morning. Morning.
10,8,LEN,"I'm, uh, Sheriff Len Cuse, uh, Hibbing P.D.  I'd like to say first off, uh, what an honor it is to have you all here in Hibbing this year."
10,8,AUDIENCE MEMBER,Obviously.
10,8,JODY,"(On her cell phone at the back of the conference room) Alex, I know you'll be okay. You are totally capable of not throwing a kegger while I'm gone – totally, totally capable.  (pauses to listen to Alex’s response) My faith in you astounds me too. I'll call you later."
10,8,JODY,Oh.
10,8,DONNA,Hiya!
10,8,JODAY,Hi.
10,8,DONNA,Looks like you didn't get a partner.
10,8,JODY,Looks like.
10,8,DONNA,"Well, you got one now."
10,8,DONNA,"Hey, Kevin."
10,8,KEVIN,"Hey, Donna."
10,8,KEVIN,"Hey, Donna."
10,8,DONNA,Yeah?
10,8,KEVIN,Hear about the body?
10,8,DONNA,What body?
10,8,JODY,"Yeah, what body? (introducing herself to Kevin) Sheriff Jody Mills."
10,8,KEVIN,Trashmen found it behind the hardware store this morning – eaten.
10,8,DONNA,(gasps) Eaten how?
10,8,KEVIN,"Like nothing left but the peach pit, you know?"
10,8,JODY,Any idea what did it?
10,8,KEVIN,"Uh, Coroner's saying animals out of the woods – bobcats and whatnot.  No wonder Sheriff Cuse was so out of sorts back there. Got this whole mess to deal with."
10,8,JODY,Attacks like this common for the area?
10,8,DONNA,"Heck no! When I lived here, we kept our critters in check.  (turning back to Kevin) Did it leave any tracks – you know, any hairs?"
10,8,KEVIN,Not even a claw mark on the body.
10,8,JODY,I'll be right back.
10,8,DONNA,"Okay. Yah. Save ya a seat, Jodes."
10,8,SAM,"(cell phone ringing) No way, heh!  Jody! How's it going?"
10,8,JODY,"Oh, you know.  Having the time of my life at a sheriff’s retreat in Hibbing."
10,8,SAM,"Wow.  Sounds like a blast. (Dean waves at the phone) Uh, Dean says hi."
10,8,JODY,You found him?  Thanks for telling me!
10,8,SAM,"Yeah. Uh, right. Sorry about that."
10,8,JODY,How's he doing?
10,8,SAM,"Good, good. Yeah, you know. Uh, you know, hold on a sec, I'm gonna put you on speaker. (beep of phone going to speakerphone function)"
10,8,DEAN,"Hey, Jody. How's Alex holding up?"
10,8,JODY,Awesome. Already head of the cheerleading squad.
10,8,SAM,Wow! Really?
10,8,JODY,"No. Sam, she smokes grass under the bleachers.  But at least she's not luring men to their deaths."
10,8,SAM,Right.
10,8,JODY,"Listen, this may not be your kind of thing, but a body was found here this morning, and something had gone to chow town on it."
10,8,SAM,"Uh, was the throat ripped out?"
10,8,JODY,Worse. I'm hearing that all the flesh had been eaten down to the bones.  Any ideas?
10,8,DEAN,"Well, it's not a vampire."
10,8,SAM,"Yeah, I-I don't know, Jody. I-I got nothing."
10,8,DEAN,"Jody, um...We could head that way. Wouldn't be any trouble at all."
10,8,JODY,"Nah, it's okay. I can handle it.  I promise I'll call if it gets to be something I can't."
10,8,SAM,"All right.  Well, uh, enjoy the retreat."
10,8,JODY,"Screw you, Winchester."
10,8,SAM,Talk soon. (Sam hangs up the phone with a chuckle)
10,8,DEAN,I'ma swallow a bag of knives if I got to keep looking at this stuff.  Let's –
10,8,SAM,"(cutting Dean off) Jody said she was on top of it, Dean."
10,8,DEAN,"Uh-huh. (pondering the books around him, throws Sam the dreaded Puppy-Dog Eyes.)"
10,8,SAM,All right.  Let's take a drive.
10,8,JODY,"(introducing herself to the coroner, Dr. Shelly Pierson) Hey. I'm Sheriff Jody mills.  I want to take a look at the body they brought in this morning."
10,8,SHELLY,Sure.  Soon as you become a member of the Hibbing police department.
10,8,JODY,"Look, I'm just trying to help here."
10,8,SHELLY,And I'm just trying to not lose my job.
10,8,SHELLY,"Hey, stranger."
10,8,DONNA,"Hiya, Shelly.  How are the kids?"
10,8,SHELLY,Ah! Little jerks.  Love them to death.  Need something?
10,8,DONNA,"Oh, I just came to check out the vic."
10,8,SHELLY,"Oh, where's Len at?"
10,8,DONNA,"Oh, he's tied up with the retreat. Big surprise, right?  But I figure what's the sense in having a hotel full of sheriffs if yah can't help out?"
10,8,SHELLY,Someone's got to get you a halo or something.
10,8,DONNA,Oh.
10,8,SHELLY,"But, um...(indicates Jody with a glance and nod of her head) What's her deal?"
10,8,DONNA,"Oh, Sheriff Mills?  Might say she left her manners back in Sioux Falls."
10,8,SHELLY,Ah.
10,8,DONNA,But she's with me.
10,8,SHELLY,Oh.
10,8,DONNA,"So, what do you say?  Curtains up?"
10,8,SHELLY,Hold on to your breakfasts. This one's grisly.
10,8,DONNA,Ufta.
10,8,JODY,(whistles)
10,8,DONNA,Ate the whole kit and caboodle. That's for darn sure.  Ya got a measuring tape? (sounds of Donna snapping on some examining gloves)
10,8,SHELLY,Yeah.
10,8,JODY,Can I see his personal effects?  (holds up victim’s pants) That string bean wore these?  Where's the belt?
10,8,SHELLY,He wasn't wearing any.
10,8,JODY,These stayed up without a belt?
10,8,SHELLY,Or...wild animals stole it.
10,8,DONNA,"Jodio.  Check this out.  Yah know, I've been huntin' since I could hold a mini rifle.  Seen darn near every bite in the book, but I couldn't tell ya what did the bitin' here."
10,8,JODY,I was afraid of that.
10,8,DONNA,Meanin'?
10,8,JODY,"Nothing.  Got me stumped, too."
10,8,WIFE,"Don't you go smoking, Howie."
10,8,HOWIE,"Uh, just watch your ""Top Model."""
10,8,DONNA,"Hiya, Len.  How's that seltzer treatin' ya?"
10,8,LEN,Oh.
10,8,LEN,Something I can help you with?
10,8,DONNA,"That animal attack last night sounded real bad, huh?"
10,8,LEN,"Yeah, sure was."
10,8,DONNA,"What kind of animal you thinkin' did it, now?"
10,8,LEN,"Oh, uh, I don't know.  We got animal control on it."
10,8,JODY,"And that's it?  (introducing herself to Len) Jody Mills, Sioux Falls."
10,8,BRICE,"Sheriff Cuse.  We have, uh...an issue with the...raffle."
10,8,LEN,"Right. Excuse me. I should go see to this.  Uh...Enjoy your night, sheriffs."
10,8,DONNA,"He's got about as much idea as we do – squat.  You know, maybe he's right.  Just let animal control take the lead."
10,8,DONNA,I used to put the cans in his cart.
10,8,JODY,"Are you really missing much?  Wait...Honestly, Donna, I just met the guy, but...Doug seems like kind of a dick."
10,8,DONNA,But he was my dick.  (pauses to watch Doug dancing) I'm gonna go hit the can – you know...where it's less gross.
10,8,DANCE FLOOR,Yeah!  Whoo!
10,8,LEN,Let's keep this to oursel–
10,8,JODY,Everything okay?
10,8,LEN,"Yeah, it's all good."
10,8,BRICE,All good with the raffle.
10,8,JODY,"Can we get real, please?"
10,8,LEN,"All right, um, you want real? Um...Somebody else turned up dead."
10,8,BRICE,Looks like another animal attack.
10,8,LEN,"Please, don't spread that.  We – we don't want to spoil everyone's good time."
10,8,JODY,Or get too many cooks in the kitchen?
10,8,LEN,"Exactly.  Now, uh, Deputy Graham and I got to go make a few calls, uh, so...try and have a good time, all right?"
10,8,JODY,Alex – Stop. No! D– Why do I hear firecrackers?  Hel–
10,8,DONNA,"So, maybe your life's not all cupcakes, either."
10,8,JODY,"Never said it was. (holds up her hands in defense of herself, revealing her car keys)"
10,8,DONNA,Uh-oh.  Flyin' the coop without me? Again?
10,8,JODY,No.
10,8,DONNA,"No, I get it. I do.  ""Take a hint, Donna,"" right? It's okay."
10,8,JODY,There's been another animal attack.
10,8,DONNA,Shut the front door.  Says who?
10,8,JODY,"I just talked to Sheriff Cuse.  I was on my way out to the morgue, but it's probably closed by now, anyway. And– But it'll wait til tomorrow."
10,8,DONNA,Anything I can help with there?
10,8,JODY,"Not unless you got any gems on how to handle a teenage girl, 'cause mine is..."
10,8,DONNA,Kind of a dick?
10,8,JODY,"She's got a whole lot more in there, too.  Really good stuff.  I was 17 once.  Yeah, hair up to here, attitude up to here.  Why can't I get through to her?"
10,8,DONNA,You let anybody through to you at that age?
10,8,JODY,Joey Demoupied.  Drove a motorcycle.  Smelled like...Mm. Yeah.
10,8,DONNA,"She'll come around. You did, right?"
10,8,JODY,Eh.
10,8,DONNA,"So, fresh corpse, jerk ex-husband, out-of-control teen. Want to get blingo'd on my minibar and watch pay-per-view?"
10,8,JODY,Thanks.  I'm gonna crash.  It's been a long day.
10,8,DONNA,Don't I know it.
10,8,JODY,I said I could handle it.
10,8,DEAN,"Nice to see you, too."
10,8,SAM,Hey.
10,8,JODY,"Hi. Okay, I'm headed to the morgue. You want in?"
10,8,SAM,"Uh, we just came from there."
10,8,JODY,And?
10,8,SAM,"And flesh was eaten off the second vic, too."
10,8,JODY,Anything missing?
10,8,DEAN,"Eh, His wallet. Why?"
10,8,JODY,Because I think a belt was missing off the first kid.
10,8,SAM,A belt? So...what?  We have monsters eating and then robbing people?
10,8,DONNA,"(in the background) Jodio, you take sugar?"
10,8,DONNA,No. No sugar.
10,8,DONNA,Okeydokes.
10,8,DEAN,"""Jodio""?"
10,8,JODY,It's – ah – Don't ask.
10,8,SAM,"Wait a second.  Isn't that, uh, uh, Donna?"
10,8,DEAN,Fat-spa Donna! Right.
10,8,DONNA,You guys know my stalker?
10,8,SAM,(groans)
10,8,DEAN,She nearly blew a case for us last time.
10,8,JODY,"Yeah, I haven't been able to shake that ray of sunshine since I got here.  She's actually been pretty helpful, but, you know, it's just tough keeping her out of this nightmare stuff, you know?"
10,8,SAM,Right. You mind distracting her while we poke around?
10,8,JODY,"You show up, and now I'm a babysitter?"
10,8,DEAN,"Look, she hasn't gotten mixed up with this crap yet.  Let's just try to keep it that way."
10,8,JODY,"Fine.  But if she tries to show me her sticker collection, I'm out."
10,8,DONNA,Agent Frehley? Agent Criss?
10,8,SAM,Hey. Sheriff Hanscum.
10,8,DONNA,"I thought that was you!  Well, ain't this a kick in the pants? What dragged you in?"
10,8,DEAN,"Uh, well, uh... We can't talk about it."
10,8,DONNA,Oh. Yeah. I hear ya.  Anything I can help with?
10,8,SAM,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Uh, nothing."
10,8,JODY,"Actually, Sheriff, I was thinking you and I could go check out the gear expo."
10,8,DONNA,What about the morgue?
10,8,JODY,"Well, you know, like you said, animal control will handle that."
10,8,DONNA,"(hesitantly) Well, if it's cool with you, it's cool with me."
10,8,JODY,Great.
10,8,DONNA,Did hear they're packing some pretty serious heat in there.
10,8,DEAN,"Hey, there.  Agents Criss and Frehley.  Looking for the sheriff...of...Hibbing."
10,8,LEN,That'd be me.
10,8,DEAN,Ah.
10,8,SAM,"Well, we're here investigating the attacks over the last couple nights.  Just wondering where you're at on that?"
10,8,LEN,"On the, uh...animal attacks?"
10,8,SAM,Yeah.
10,8,BRICE,"Wait, wait, wait.  You're telling me the FBI's got nothing better to do?"
10,8,DEAN,"Well, we go where the boss tells us to."
10,8,BRICE,To what – arrest a bobcat from Hibbing?
10,8,DEAN,Is there a problem?
10,8,BRICE,"No. No, there's no problem.  You ain't the first feds to roll through here and come up with nothing. Sure is cute to watch you try, though."
10,8,DEAN,"Oh, pal, the FBI doesn't do cute."
10,8,SAM,"Uh, Sheriff Cuse, we are just hoping there might be some surveillance footage of the attacks.  Maybe a traffic camera caught something."
10,8,LEN,"Right. No. Sorry, I-I-I don't have a record of it. Speaking of, uh...Can you keep an eye on the expo for me, uh, deputy?  I got to check in with the guys at animal control.  Agents, good to meet you. Uh...help yourself to a bear claw."
10,8,SAM,Sheriff's lying?
10,8,DEAN,Deputy douche seems to think so.
10,8,SAM,All right. I'll go try and crack the police server.  Maybe something showed up on surveillance.
10,8,DEAN,"Yeah, maybe I'll go crack the deputy."
10,8,SAM,"Right, but this time, try to be a little less defensive of your ""pretend job."""
10,8,DEAN,"You know, this badge means something."
10,8,SAM,I made it at Kinko's.
10,8,DEAN,"Yes, you did.  Be proud of that."
10,8,DONNA,Son of a gun.
10,8,VENDOR,"Uh, officer ladies, check this one out.  You can take it to lunch, to the gym, have your nails done. She's always by your side."
10,8,JODY,How about this puppy?
10,8,VENDOR,"Oh. Well, it depends. Think you can handle a big one?"
10,8,JODY,"Sigma, right?"
10,8,DONNA,10 pounds pull weight. Cute.
10,8,JODY,Call this a big one?  Hope you drive a Porsche.
10,8,DOUG,"Chaz. (Addressing the vendor)  If you're trying to pull the wool over this one, you got the wrong girl.  Sheriff Hanscum here is a wolf in sheepskin, right? (chuckles)"
10,8,DONNA,Thank you.  Wolves are majestic creatures.  But save your flattery for other female people.
10,8,DOUG,"Oh. Oh, Sheriff Goodhill. No. No.  I mean, yeah.  But, you know, we just met.  Cufflinks – you know how it is."
10,8,JODY,Cuff what?
10,8,DOUG,"Cufflinks!  It's a dating site for cops.  Y-You on it, Donna?"
10,8,DONNA,Me? No.  Not quite there yet.
10,8,DOUG,"Oh, you still, uh, getting in date shape, huh? Huh?"
10,8,DONNA,It's more like trying to get through the stuff on my DVR first.
10,8,JODY,"Oh, for the love of god. (addressing Doug) What is wrong with you?!  You get off on fat-shaming chicks?  (turning to Donna) You are so not fat, by the way.  (Back to Doug) And you – you are just a douche."
10,8,DOUG,"Uh, okay.  I'll just, uh... Okay, then."
10,8,DONNA,"What the h-e-double hockey sticks, Jody?  Calling my ex a douche to his face?"
10,8,JODY,It didn't look like you were gonna do it!
10,8,DONNA,What would be the point?  We're divorced! You really think I'm gonna change him now?
10,8,JODY,So he gets to treat you like a doormat forever? Is that it?
10,8,DONNA,"How about this?  'Til you've actually lost a husband, you keep your mouth zipped about mine."
10,8,DONNA,Did something happen... to your husband?
10,8,JODY,"We all have our crosses to bear, right?"
10,8,DONNA,"Hey, I'm sorry if I –"
10,8,JODY,No.  It’s fair. I certainly went there.
10,8,DONNA,You want to talk about it or –
10,8,JODY,Not right now.
10,8,DONNA,"All right, then.  I'm gonna go get some air."
10,8,BRICE,Agent. Are you looking for some teeny-weeny handcuffs to slap on some paws?
10,8,DEAN,I think we got off on the wrong foot.
10,8,BRICE,"Right.  How's that, exactly?"
10,8,DEAN,"Well, this investigation that my partner and I are here on, it's – it's big.  And, uh, we're looking for some local help – you know, someone who's not ah – not afraid to talk shop with the big boys back in D.C.  Think that might be something you'd be interested in?"
10,8,BRICE,Might be.  What can I do?
10,8,DEAN,"Well, first of all, I'm gonna need you to be totally straight with me.  Is there any footage of the attack – anything?"
10,8,BRICE,"Sheriff Cuse changed the password on the server yesterday.  It's got the live feed from the traffic camera across the street from where that first vic got attacked. When I went to go check the footage, sheriff said he'd do it himself."
10,8,DEAN,Did he say why?
10,8,BRICE,"But, you know, sheriff's a-a straight shooter.  I'm sure he had his reasons."
10,8,DEAN,"I'm sure he did.  All right, well, I appreciate the cooperation, Deputy, and, uh, when I need you, I'll come find you, okay?"
10,8,BRICE,All right.
10,8,DEAN,All right.
10,8,DEAN,"Animal attack, my ass.  You seen Sheriff Cuse around?"
10,8,JODY,Not since the expo.
10,8,DEAN,"Yeah, me neither."
10,8,JODY,"How you doing, kiddo?"
10,8,DEAN,Me?  Fantastic. Why?
10,8,JODY,Word 'round the campfire is you went off the rez a couple months back.
10,8,DEAN,That right?  You and Sam been passing notes during class?  It's nothing I can't handle.
10,8,JODY,Just sayin'.  I make a mean bowl of chowder if you ever need to talk.
10,8,DEAN,I appreciate that.
10,8,SAM,Hey.
10,8,DEAN,You got something?
10,8,SAM,"Uh, well, there was something.  I hacked into the surveillance server, but the files had been deleted."
10,8,JODY,I thought you said that sheriff Cuse was the only one who had access to those files.
10,8,SAM,"Um, hi."
10,8,DONNA,"Hi.  Jody, can we talk a sec?  Alone?"
10,8,DEAN,"Yeah, we'll go – we'll go look around."
10,8,JODY,"Okay, first of all, back there, I was wrong to butt in.  I know it hurt you, and I'm – I'm sorry."
10,8,DONNA,"What?  Oh. Yah. ""Quit being a doormat."" Yah.  I hear ya, Jody.  It's okay. We're okay.  Only... There's something else I can't quite wrap my head around.  You ever think there are things out there – things that...don't end up on the police blotter?"
10,8,JODY,Can you give me some specifics?
10,8,DONNA,"Yeah. Okay.  Uh, well, I was – I was kinda far away, so maybe I didn't see it right, but what I think I saw... were teeth. (taps her own teeth)  It was Sheriff Cuse.  I saw him standing over Sheriff Goodhill's body, and his mouth was full of... Shark teeth, like some kind of..."
10,8,JODY,Monster?
10,8,DONNA,You think I'm crazy.
10,8,JODY,Not at all.  Did he see you?
10,8,DONNA,No. I hid – like a chump.  You really believe me?
10,8,JODY,Yeah.  So will those guys from the FBI.
10,8,DONNA,"If you say so. Hey.  Yesterday, I saw Cuse taking his stuff into a room down the hall from mine.  Must have been...304."
10,8,JODY,"Sam, Cuse is our guy.  Donna said she saw him check in to 304.  Hit me back."
10,8,DONNA,What now?  Just let the locals handle it?
10,8,JODY,"Oh, trust me – the locals should not handle this."
10,8,DONNA,(whispering) Look at all this sunblock.  You'd think he's at the Copacabana or somethin'.
10,8,JODY,I'll explain later.
10,8,DONNA,What the heck is that for?!
10,8,SAM,Whoa. Whoa. Got your voicemail.
10,8,JODY,(simultaneously with Donna) Sheriff Cuse is a vampire.
10,8,DONNA,(simultaneously with Jody) She just pulled out a machete.
10,8,JODY,Donna saw his teeth.
10,8,DONNA,What the cuss?!  A vampire?!
10,8,DEAN,(to Jody) You want to give her the talk?
10,8,DONNA,Heck.  Just...Heck.
10,8,DEAN,We good?
10,8,DONNA,"Wait. So, when we were at the weight-loss spa –"
10,8,DEAN,Monsters.  Sucking on your fat.  We took care of them.
10,8,DONNA,"Ah, jeez.  I knew losing 10 pounds that fast was too good to be true.  (pulls the note from Cuse’s hotel room and hands it to Sam) Here.  Maybe this is where sheriff...vampire went."
10,8,DEAN,It could be anything.  (beeping of Sam putting the address into mapquest)  What do you got?
10,8,SAM,Looks like it's an old farm outside of town.
10,8,DEAN,Could be something.
10,8,DONNA,And it's the only lead we got.
10,8,SAM,"""We""?  All due respect, Sheriff, but vampires are far more dangerous than the johns you throw in jail."
10,8,DEAN,You're gonna sit this one out.
10,8,DONNA,"Stuff you, Dean!  Or whatever your real name is."
10,8,JODY,Hanscum's good.
10,8,SAM,Jody –
10,8,JODY,(cutting Dean off) I said she's good.
10,8,DEAN,"Okay. All right.  But you're staying back.  We're taking the lead, okay?"
10,8,DEAN,"If you're gonna swing, swing hard.  With vamps, head's gotta roll."
10,8,DONNA,Got it.
10,8,LEN,Run!
10,8,Starr,"Well, hi, there, sunflower."
10,8,Act IV,
10,8,STARR,"It's all love, pretty boy.  All of you will become all of us.  We won't waste one bit."
10,8,DEAN,"Okay, Mufasa, enough with the ""Circle of Life"" crap.  You're a vampire."
10,8,STARR,Mm-hmm.
10,8,DEAN,"You're scum. End of story.  (Starr starts to take off his belt) Yeah, I'm not in the mood."
10,8,JODY,"Wait – it's not enough that you kill people.  You've got to rob them, too?"
10,8,STARR,We scavenge.  We don't sip and go.  We use every part of the buffalo.
10,8,JODY,And to think I gave you lunch money.
10,8,STARR,But you came in time for dinner.
10,8,LEN,"Starr, please, let them go.  I helped you out.  I-I ditched that video o-of Catfish killing that man."
10,8,STARR,"We didn't want favors, Len.  We wanted you."
10,8,LEN,What use am I now?  I don't even kill people.  I-I'm on bagged blood.
10,8,DONNA,"Uh, I beg your pardon?  I saw you with your vampire face standing over Sheriff Goodhill."
10,8,LEN,"No, no, I-I-I found her. I – I s-smelled her blood.  I-I couldn't help my – my fangs.  But I didn't bite."
10,8,DEAN,"Well, aren't you a hero."
10,8,STARR,It's your nature to eat people.  A vampire who doesn't feed is like a – like a...
10,8,MALE VAMPIRE,Tiger eating salad.
10,8,STARR,"We're not gonna stop, Len.  We'll take down every person in your sweet, little Hibbing till you come back to the nest."
10,8,SAM,"So, what'd you do, Len?  You, uh, break up Burning Man?"
10,8,STARR,"More like Woodstock.  Len found me crying on the curb after my daddy kicked me out.  I got in Len's van, and the rest is wavy gravy."
10,8,JODY,"So, what – Len's like your Charlie Manson?"
10,8,STARR,Ohhh.  Charlie couldn't hold a candle to Len.  He taught us everything.
10,8,DEAN,"Yeah, I'm sure it was all Kombucha and Kumbaya."
10,8,STARR,"Liberating is what it was.  And then, one day, poof!  Len's gone."
10,8,MALE VAMPIRE,Till he landed his photo in the paper. Stupid.
10,8,STARR,"For running a police retreat, of all things.  You didn't just go straight.  You became a damn cop.  Now, that is wild, man.  Are you feeling dirty, Len?  'Cause we're about to have ourselves a bloodbath."
10,8,LEN,Don't you want to know why I left?
10,8,STARR,I already know why.  You got boring.
10,8,LEN,I got a conscience.
10,8,STARR,Oh?
10,8,LEN,"Prey that begged for their lives – I-it was like even if I used every part, like I taught you, I mean, it's still wrong."
10,8,SAM,So you walked away.
10,8,LEN,I tried to protect people.  After so many years of...gutting them.  That's why I'm here.  I'll join your bloody caravan... If it means you won't kill these people.
10,8,STARR,We aren't killing anyone.  You are.
10,8,JODY,You don't have to do this.
10,8,LEN,Kiss my ass.
10,8,STARR,"Mm.  We love you, brother.  But we don't know who you are anymore. (Starr beheads Len) Can't say we didn't try."
10,8,DEAN,(breaks free and takes out two vamps) Unh!
10,8,STARR,(Hisses in Jody's face)
10,8,DONNA,"(also breaks free and beheads Starr as she's about to bite Jody) Hakuna matata, lady."
10,8,DEAN,"Now, that's what I'm talking about."
10,8,JODY,You okay?
10,8,DONNA,"Yeah.  Other than feeling like I want to hurl, sure."
10,8,SAM,Hey.
10,8,DONNA,I just...chopped off...a vampire's head.
10,8,JODY,You were great at that.
10,8,DONNA,Thanks.
10,8,SAM,You good?
10,8,DEAN,"Yeah.  Yeah, you know, for the first time I've been back, I didn't feel like the Mark was pushing me."
10,8,SAM,First time?
10,8,DONNA,Knowing that these things are out there makes the world seem – I don't know – bigger...darker.
10,8,DEAN,"All I know is, back there, killing those vamps... I felt like me again."
10,8,SAM,"All right.  So, that's...good, right?"
10,8,DEAN,Yeah.
10,8,JODY,"You know, if you want any pointers on how to fight this crazy crap, I'm willing to fill you in – you know, what kills what."
10,8,DONNA,I'd like that.
10,8,SAM,"Okay.  Well, let's go with that."

10,11,SAM,"All right, well, just -- just keep me posted, okay?  Yeah, you got it.  Wait, Cas. You there?  Hey, thanks.  Yeah. (Sam hangs up the phone as Dean throws down an omelet in front of Sam) You made egg-white omelettes?"
10,11,DEAN,"Yeah. Breakfast of Champions -- you know, if you're a dork like you."
10,11,DEAN,"Yeah, well, until we get answers on this Mark of Cain, I am on a 12-step program not to backslide."
10,11,SAM,12 steps?
10,11,DEAN,"Yeah.  Hey, if Cain found a way to live with it after going dark side, then I just got to find a way to keep it in check, so haven't had a drink in a week, eight hours of rack time every night, and . . . now this masterpiece."
10,11,SAM,That's three steps.
10,11,DEAN,Shut up and eat.
10,11,SAM,Wow. That's -- that's awesome. (referring to the omelette)

10,11,SAM,"So, you know, I was looking into the news, checking for anything weird, right?  I found this story about a torture vic.  Apparently, some kid videotaped this at his next-door neighbor's house."
10,11,DEAN,"What are you saying, Charlie tortured someone?"
10,11,SAM,Uh . . .
10,11,DEAN,"Our Charlie?  Yea high, wouldn't hurt a Hobbit, practically sparkles?"

10,11,SAM,"District attorney in Topeka.  According to this article, he wasn't the only person in town that was hit.  Uh, a court stenographer was assaulted the night before."
10,11,DEAN,"Well, you know, Charlie wouldn't go off on someone without a reason."
10,11,SAM,"Yeah, I wouldn't think so either, but look at the video."
10,11,DEAN,"Oh, I'm looking at it.  But you know what we do, taken out of context, it doesn't look that much different.  She could be hunting. (Sam sighs) Why don't we go talk to this asshat and see what's going on?"

10,11,SAM,"Now, did you notice anything odd before the attack -- any, uh, strange smells, weird noises?"
10,11,PETER HARPER,"No, no, nothing.  I was just at home here, getting ready for bed, and that crazy bitch jumped me.  All she wanted was to know was about some case that I worked on"
10,11,DEAN,"The Middletons.  They had a daughter, 12 years old.  They were on their way"
10,11,PETER HARPER,"Yeah, that's right.  How did you know that?"
10,11,DEAN,"Well, we do our homework at the FBI."
10,11,PETER HARPER,"Okay, well, then you know the case never went to trial.  Before I could even see the evidence, it was off the books.  All the files were sealed."
10,11,SAM,"Now, how is that even possible?"
10,11,PETER HARPER,I don't know.  But I looked into it this morning.  There's no record of that case
10,11,SAM,"Now, is there anything else you can remember about the case -- any names you can think of?"
10,11,PETER HARPER,"No.  Like I told the police, it was so long ago.  Look, I'm sorry."
10,11,SAM,"All right.  Here's the thing.  We talked to the other victim on the way here -- the stenographer.  Now, she said the attacker didn't let her go until she gave up a name -- your name."
10,11,PETER HARPER,Okay.  But w-what does that have to do with m-me being attacked
10,11,DEAN,What name did you give up?
10,11,PETER HARPER,"Look, I told you everything I told the police.  This woman comes in here, beats the tar out of me, but -- but there's no name to give up, so I-I don't know what else to --"
10,11,DEAN,"Talk, you son of a bitch!"
10,11,PETER HARPER,"Hey, look, I'm the victim, here! (As Dean makes to drop his chair backwards) Aah!"
10,11,DEAN,Talk!
10,11,PETER HARPER,"Okay. Okay. All right.  All right. (Dean rights his chair) Aah. (rubs his shoulder) After the files were sealed . . . I pushed.  And, uh . . . They offered me money -- a lot of money."
10,11,DEAN,Give me a name.
10,11,PETER HARPER,The money kept on coming in from overseas accounts.
10,11,DEAN,Give me a name!
10,11,PETER HARPER,I will be disbarred!
10,11,DEAN,"(quiet and ominous) That'll be the least of your worries, I promise you that."
10,11,PETER HARPER,Councilwoman Barbara Cordry.
10,11,SAM,"Celeste Middleton.  Celeste -- that's Charlie's real name.  Guess she's looking for the person who, uh, destroyed her family."
10,11,DEAN,"Can you blame her?  You know, we just got to find her before she does something nobody can walk away from."
10,11,SAM,Barbara Cordry?
10,11,BARBARA CORDRY,Can I help you?
10,11,SAM,"Yes.  I'm Special Agent Gabriel.  This is my partner, Special Agent Collins.  May we come in?"
10,11,BARBARA CORDRY,What's this about?
10,11,SAM,We have some questions about a drunk-driving case from a while back involving the Middleton family.
10,11,BARBARA CORDRY,I have no idea what you're talking about.
10,11,DEAN,"Ma'am, if we could just --"
10,11,BARBARA CORDRY,Sorry.  I'm still on vacation.  Feel free to schedule an appointment with my assistant.  She'll pencil you both in. (shuts the door in their faces.)
10,11,DEAN,Guilty much?
10,11,SAM,Yeah.
10,11,DEAN,(Bites into a sandwich) What the hell is kale?
10,11,SAM,"(reading from the Charlie’s file) ""Anti-authority disorder, clinical depression, violent outbursts.""  Charlie was, uh . . ."
10,11,DEAN,"Dude.  If a shrink interviewed us at that age, you think the report would be all kittens and rainbows?  Come on.  She's a good kid.  There's got to be an explanation for this, man.  There's just got to be."
10,11,CHARLIE,Should have known Rocket and Groot would track me down.
10,11,SAM,Let her go.
10,11,CHARLIE,"Who?  Oh, her?"
10,11,SAM,Don't do this.
10,11,CHARLIE,I just want answers.
10,11,DEAN,Yeah?  Since when do you start pounding on people for those?  What the hell happened to you in Oz?
10,11,CHARLIE,Everything I wanted.  An adventure.  Even got my own little sword.
10,11,SAM,Charlie --
10,11,SAM,"Oh, Sam, you're adorable.  You're not gonna hurt me.  In fact, that's your problem -- all good-guy code, no bite.  What a waste.  And you . . . (turning to Dean)  Always letting this albatross hold you back."
10,11,DEAN,"Okay, all right, you know what?  I don't know what's going on here, okay?  But this -- this is not you."
10,11,CHARLIE,"Oh, it's me, all right."
10,11,DEAN,"Charlie, put the knife down.  Let her go.  We don't want to hurt you, kiddo, but we're not gonna let you do this."
10,11,DEAN,(fighting with Charlie in the entryway after chasing her through the house) Stop! Crap! (muttered with Charlie’s legs around his neck)  Sam!
10,11,SAM,You all right?
10,11,BARBARA CORDRY,Yeah.
10,11,SAM,What did she say to you?
10,11,BARBARA CORDRY,She -- she just -- she wanted the bank statements.
10,11,DEAN,(running outside while Charlie drives away in a large SUV) Charlie! Hey!
10,11,DEAN,"Oh, you son of a bitch."
10,11,CHARLIE,"(Charlie pulls up in her yellow VW) What's up, bitches?  Right.  Um we should probably catch up."
10,11,SAM,"There two of you -- one good, one . . . bad?"
10,11,DEAN,"Yeah, what, dick you is some sort of a ninja?"
10,11,CHARLIE,"She is a badass, yeah."
10,11,SAM,"O-okay.  Hold on. Back up.  We were there for Dorothy, Oz, yellow brick road.  B-but then . . ."
10,11,CHARLIE,"War.  The war for Emerald City.  It was awesome.  Until not so much.  We were gonna lose, so I made a deal with the wizard . . . of Oz.  Wears a hood and a creepy mask, kind of a jerk -- good times.  He said for us to win, I had to unleash my true darkness, which he meant literally.  He used the inner key of Oz.  It opens a door to your soul and lets the darkness out.  Uh, we're still connected physically.  If you hurt her, you hurt me.  But bottom line, she's bad, and I'm good.  And let me just tell you,  being good is really annoying.  Normally in a place like this,  I'd be pounding Harvey Wallbangers and checking out the bartender's ass.  Now all I want to do is sip club soda and send her to college."
10,11,DEAN,"Okay, uh . . . good Charlie.  So, why is dark Charlie gunning for revenge?"
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,"She's trying to win me back.  Dark Charlie won the war single-handedly.  But... She did some truly awful things.  But I told her I didn't want any part of her near me again, ever.  Going after the person who mur-- mur-- uh...Who took my parents away is her messed-up way of showing me how close we are, or -- or could be.  I keep calling her ""she,"" but she's me.  I'm the one doing this."
10,11,DEAN,"Charlie, that -- that's not who you are, okay?  It's -- it's a twisted version of --"
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,Me.  I've been following her so I can catch her before she does something stupid a-and just lock her away forever.
10,11,SAM,"Uh, Charlie? . . . That's not an answer."
10,11,DEAN,"Sam's right.  We'll go back to Oz, and we'll -- we'll get the key from the wizard of douche, and we'll put you back together."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,Even if I did want her back . . . Look dark me broke the key.  There's no way to get back to the wizard.
10,11,SAM,"Okay, okay, first thing's first.  We need to find dark Charlie before she finds the drunk driver.  So, we know Barbara gave up her old bank statements, right?  That means dark Charlie will probably follow the money back to whoever made the payoffs."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,That's what I would do.
10,11,SAM,All right.
10,11,DEAN,I'll get some refills. (goes to the bar with the glasses)
10,11,SAM,We need you . . . to hack into Barbara's bank accounts. (pulls out his computer)
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,I can't. (pushes the computer back to Sam)
10,11,SAM,What?
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,It's bad.  I told you -- being good is annoying.
10,11,SAM,"How about this -- how about you guide me through the process, and then I'm the bad one?"
10,11,SAM,"Okay, so, Barbara's payments all came from offshore accounts, which were routed through dummy corporations, which have all gone belly-up."
10,11,DEAN,"All right, skip to the end, dragon tattoo.  They all lead back to this guy?"
10,11,SAM,"Russell Wellington.  And according to his personal records, he had a-a car that was reported stolen the -- the week of the accident, a-a car that was never recovered.  And after the supposed ""theft,"" he went on a sabbatical from work for two weeks and returned to work with bruises and a broken ankle."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,"So this is him.  This is the man who, uh . . ."
10,11,DEAN,(closes the computer) And you're done.  Sam. (pulls Sam to the side to consult with him)
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,"Hey, dudes. Dudes.  Secrets are bad."
10,11,DEAN,"Charlie, I don't think you should be anywhere around this piece-of-crap salesman."
10,11,SAM,"And -- and I don't think that finding dark Charlie and locking her up is gonna work.  I mean, she may be . . . dark, but she's still a part of you."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,"You're right.  I hate it, but you're right.  Okay.  Let's go to the bunker.  Baum used the key to Oz.  Maybe there's something in the Men of Letters' files about the key.  If we fix it, we can get back to Oz."
10,11,DEAN,"All right, you guys dig into that.  I'm gonna keep an eye on Russell and, uh . . . wait for dark Charlie to show up.  Are you sure?"
10,11,SAM,"Dean, maybe -- maybe I should be the one . . ."
10,11,DEAN,"No, no, no, no, no.  I got . It's, uh -- I just can't believe I have to . . . protect this piece of crap."
10,11,SAM,"No, you got to protect them both.  I mean, if dark Charlie gets hurt, then..."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,"So do I, so . . . be careful."
10,11,DEAN,Got it. (exit Dean)
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,Is he okay?
10,11,SAM,Uh . . . I'll tell you on the way. Come on.
10,11,TAPE DECK,"“The key to quieting your mind, is minding your quiet.  Know and understand the lack of an answer is --”"
10,11,SAM,"Okay, here we go.  Clive Dillon.  He is the Man of Letters that first discovered the key to Oz.  So, according to this incident report, Clive went to Oz, but he left the key on earth, and then L. Frank Baum found the key and went to rescue Clive in Oz."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,That's when Dorothy snuck along for the ride and got stuck there.
10,11,SAM,"Right.  And then after Baum rescued Clive, Clive came back and retired."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,You can retire from the Men of Letters?
10,11,SAM,"Well, apparently, they put him in some sort of, like, uh, witness-relocation program."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,Where did he end up?
10,11,SAM,Let's find out.
10,11,OFFICE ASSISTANT,Mr. Presley?  Mr. Presley?
10,11,DEAN,"Yes. Yeah. Hi. Uh, actually, I'm, uh, you know, really into this article on, uh . . . mammograms.  Riveting stuff.  If somebody else wants to go . . . (looks around the room and sees that he’s the last person left)  Right. Yes. Okay.  Well . . . let's do this."
10,11,OFFICE ASSISTANT,"(shows Dean into Wellington’s office) Mr. Presley for you, sir."
10,11,RUSSELL WELLINGTON,Is that it for the day?
10,11,OFFICE ASSISTANT,"Yes, sir."
10,11,RUSSELL WELLINGTON,"Okay. You can head out.  Uh, I need my, uh, dry cleaning taken to the lake house, and, uh, pick up Pepper and take her to the dog groomers, okay?"
10,11,OFFICE ASSISTANT,"Yes, sir. (office assistant leaves)"
10,11,RUSSELL WELLINGTON,"Thank you.  Mr. Presley, Russell Wellington.  Please have a seat.  So . . . What can you tell me about what you're looking for today?"
10,11,DEAN,"Uh, right.  Well, um . . . Let me describe my dream home."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,"The Men of Letters gave Clive a new name, a new house, both of which are still listed.  I think Clive might be still alive."
10,11,SAM,"Y-- well, he'd be, like, 100-something."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,"Time passes differently in Oz.  It's close by.  Let's go look.  If he's still kicking, he is the only person who might be able to fix the key to Oz."
10,11,SAM,"All right, let's go."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,Okay.
10,11,DEAN,I'm not saying that I have to have a jacuzzi.  I'm just saying that I really like bubbles.
10,11,RUSSELL WELLINGTON,"Uh, Mr. Presley, look, I'm just gonna stop you right there.  Judging from your cheap shoes and your faded jeans, I'm guessing the only house you're in the market for comes with wheels.  Now, look, I'm a busy man.  My time is extremely valuable.  I prefer not to have it wasted by some hayseed."
10,11,DEAN,I'm willing to buy if you're willing to sell.  So why don't you show me what you got?
10,11,RUSSELL WELLINGTON,"Well, I can show you the door. (picks up the phone to call security, Dean breaks off the call) Who the hell do you think you are?"
10,11,DEAN,I'm the guy who's gonna save your life.
10,11,RUSSELL WELLINGTON,Excuse me?
10,11,DEAN,"Hill and Oak Street.  Station wagon with a man and a woman in it, on their way to pick up their little daughter from a slumber party.  That ring a bell?"
10,11,RUSSELL WELINGTON,I-I-I-I don't know what you're talking about.
10,11,DEAN,"Oh, no, you wouldn't, 'cause you were too drunk to remember anything that night."
10,11,RUSSELL WELLINGTON,I think you have me confused with somebody else.  Or somebody that cares.  Or maybe somebody who wouldn't pay people off to cover up manslaughter.
10,11,RUSSELL WELLINGTON,You're insane.
10,11,RUSSELL WELLINGTON,What the hell is going on?
10,11,DEAN,Stay here.  Do not leave this room.
10,11,DEAN,Charlie?  Let's talk about this.
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,"You Winchester boys and your talk.  Blah, blah, blah, repressed feelings.  Blah, blah, blah, passive aggression."
10,11,DEAN,"Come on, kiddo.  You don't want to do this."
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,I don't want to hurt him.  I just want to talk.
10,11,DEAN,"Yeah, like you talked to all the others?"
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,You're right.  I got out of hand.  But this was never about revenge.
10,11,DEAN,Right.
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,"I want him to see my face.  I want him to see what he did to me . . . to us.  That's all.  Please, Dean.  I deserve that.  And then we hand him over to the cops. (hands Dean her knife)"
10,11,DEAN,Okay. (takes Dark Charlie’s knife)
10,11,RUSSELL WELLINGTON,Mr. -- (upon seeing Dark Charlie) Celeste.
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,"No one's called me that in a long, long time."
10,11,RUSSELL WELLINGTON,"Uh . . . I am so sorry.  What I did -- it . . . I was young.  I was stupid.  What I took, I . . . I can never give back to you.  But what I did after the accident, that never should have happened.  And I wasn't drunk for that.  I was stone-cold sober.  It was selfish . . . and wrong.  And I should pay for it.  And I will pay for it."
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,You took everything from me.
10,11,RUSSELL WELLINGTON,"Please . . . Celeste, I am so sorry."
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,"Russell?  I forgive you. (she turns, slams and locks the door)"
10,11,RUSSELL WELLINGTON,Wh--
10,11,DEAN,"(from behind the door) Charlie!  Charlie!  Don't do this, Charlie!"
10,11,SAM,"Dean.  Hey, hold on.  I'm putting you on speaker.  What happened?"
10,11,DEAN,(on the speakerphone) It's over.
10,11,SAM,"What do you mean, ""it's over""?"
10,11,DEAN,She got to Russell.  She killed him.
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,"Oh, my God."
10,11,DEAN,"Charlie, if you can hear me, I'm so sorry."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,It's not your fault.  It's mine.
10,11,DEAN,"No, no, no. don't -- don't say that.  This is not on you."
10,11,SAM,"All right, let's, uh -- let's try and stick to the plan, guys."
10,11,DEAN,Did you guys find a way back to Oz?
10,11,SAM,"Maybe.  Uh, look, t-the Man of Letters who originally found the key -- he's still alive.  He lives in Junction City under the name Michael Carter.  I'll text you the address. Just come meet us."
10,11,DEAN,All right.  I'm on my way.
10,11,HOT BARTENDER,Are you gonna stare at that all night?
10,11,DEAN,I'm pacing myself.
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,She's cute.
10,11,DEAN,You lied to me.
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,"You lied to yourself.  That's kind of your move.  Something's off about you, though, isn't it?  It's always something with you boys."
10,11,DEAN,I've made mistakes.  But I'll pay for mine.  And you'll pay for yours.
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,"Come on, Dean.  I'm not the monster here. He was.  He got what he deserved.  You know I'm right.  You know what I learned about being dark?  It sets you free.  And part of you knows that's right, too."
10,11,CLIVE DILLON,Hello?
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,Clive Dillon?
10,11,CLIVE DILLON,No. My name is --
10,11,SAM,"Michael Carter, right.  But it was Clive Dillon, wasn't it?  Back in the Men of Letters?  Back in Oz?"
10,11,CLIVE DILLON,You seem to be confused.  There's no Clive Dillon here.  And Oz?  That's just a fairy tale.  It's best left on the bookshelves where it belongs.
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,So you've never seen this before? (holds out half of the Key to Oz)
10,11,HOT BARTENDER,Enjoy.
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,Delicious.
10,11,DEAN,"All right, listen, Dark Charlie."
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,"Oh, grow up.  There's no right. There's no wrong.  There's just us . . . And them."
10,11,DEAN,"Yeah, well, there's not gonna be a you for very much longer."
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,Uh-oh. Did princess me find a way back to Oz?
10,11,DEAN,"That's right.  Yeah, a former Man of Letters, retired, in Grantville, two towns over.  They're gonna fix the key to Oz, find the wizard, and put you back to where you belong."
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,"Back into Charlie?  Is that where I belong?  Well . . . Hm.  We'll just see, won't we?  In the meantime . . . if you're not gonna ask her (indicating the hot bartender) to dance, then I will."
10,11,DEAN,"What happened, did my friend strike out?"
10,11,HOT BARTENDER,Your friend?  She just left out the back door.
10,11,DEAN,"No, no, no, no!  Oh, you son of a bitch!  Damn it.  (pulls out his phone) Sam?"
10,11,SAM,(on the phone) Hey. Where the hell are you?
10,11,DEAN,Dick Charlie just hot-wired Baby.  She thinks she's on her way to you.
10,11,SAM,What?
10,11,DEAN,"I told her the wrong town, so I probably bought you a little time, but, uh, just be on the lookout.  I'll be there as soon as I can jack a ride."
10,11,SAM,Thanks. Hurry.
10,11,DEAN,Ah. (in satisfaction when he finds an open car door)
10,11,CLIVE DILLON,The six keys of Oz were forged from Oz steel.  They can only be repaired in that magical realm.
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,So there's no going back?  I can't put my darkness away?
10,11,CLIVE DILLON,I'm sorry.
10,11,SAM,What happened to you in Oz?
10,11,CLIVE DILLON,It's in my report.
10,11,SAM,Your report just said you were kidnapped.  By whom?
10,11,CLIVE DILLON,Bad people.
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,I know that look.  You're lying.  And lying is --
10,11,CLIVE DILLON,"--bad.  Yes, I know.  What happened to you, my dear, happened to me."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,What?
10,11,CLIVE DILLON,"A coven of witches grabbed me.  They used the inner key on me, unleashed my ID.  He was awful.  He killed all the witches and went into a tantrum.  Was power-hungry, crazy.  He became the wizard of Oz."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,"Frank's daughter, Dorothy, runs Emerald City now.  The wizard, dark you,"
10,11,CLIVE DILLON,"Well, without the key to Oz, there's no way we can get back to the wizard.  But . . . There may well be a way . . . to summon him here. (Dillon pulls a gun out from a drawer)  If I am mortally wounded, he'll have to come back here to save us both."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,"Wait, wait, wait. There has to be another way."
10,11,CLIVE DILLON,"What he has done is my fault.  After all, he is me, and I am him, so . . . Maybe it's time that both of us answered for our sins.  It's the good thing to do, right?  Right?"
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,I figured you'd lie about where to go to next.  That's what I would do.
10,11,DEAN,What the hell do you want?
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,I just want to talk to her.
10,11,DEAN,"Oh, you're not going anywhere near her.  I'm not gonna let you corrupt her."
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,Corrupt her?
10,11,DEAN,"You take one more step, I'm gonna put you down."
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,There's the Dean I love.
10,11,CLIVE DILLAN,Aah!
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,"Aah! (her mouth is suddenly bleeding, and she looks at Sam, panicked.)"
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,You hit like a girl who never learned how to hit.
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,Aah!
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,"That's it, big boy.  Let it all out."
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,Ow! Ow!
10,11,SAM,"Stop this, please!  Let me help my friend."
10,11,DEAN,You hurt my friend.
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,I learned it by watching you. (Dean gets Dark Charlie and breaks her arm)
10,11,GOOD CHARLIE,Aah! Ow!  (pointing the gun at Good Clive) I'm sorry.
10,11,GOOD CLIVE,"I forgive you.  We both do. (Charlie shoots Good Clive, killing him and the Wizard)"
10,11,SAM,"Charlie, hang on.  Hey, you okay?  (carrying Charlie outside) Dean! Dean!"
10,11,DARK CHARLIE,"(to Good Charlie, whom Sam has lain next to her) You did it, didn't you?  You killed the wizard.  I knew it.  The magic was in you all the time.  Celeste."
10,11,SAM,(cradling Charlie) Charlie. Charlie. Hey. I got you.  It's okay.  It's okay.
10,11,SAM,"Yeah, he's, uh, he's better.  I mean, he's calmed down now.  Cas, we got to -- we got to find Cain, or . . . We got to find something, you know?  Right.  Yeah, I know.  I hear you. Okay.  You got it.  All right. Thanks. (Sam hangs up the phone.  Charlie enters the library.)  Hey. Uh, shouldn't you be resting up?"
10,11,CHARLIE,I think sleeping for two days in a row is probably enough.
10,11,SAM,So . . . are you . . .
10,11,CHARLIE,Good? Bad?  I think I'll just settle for balanced.  (Dean watches from the table and then goes back to his research)  Anything about the Mark?
10,11,SAM,"Yeah, maybe.  I found this book.  It's a lore book -- ""The Book of the Damned."""
10,11,CHARLIE,Sounds legit.
10,11,SAM,"It's in a library somewhere in Tuscany.  It might be a dead end, but I figured..."
10,11,CHARLIE,I'll go check it out.
10,11,SAM,Whoa--
10,11,CHARLIE,"Look, there's no going back to Oz.  And with the wizard gone, Dorothy will be fine."
10,11,SAM,"So, does this mean no more adventure?"
10,11,CHARLIE,I think we have all the adventure we can handle right here.
10,11,SAM,What about --
10,11,CHARLIE,"Dark Charlie?  She's, uh . . . Quiet.  I just got to keep moving forward.  We all do."
10,11,DEAN,"Charlie, I . . ."
10,11,CHARLIE,We are going to fix this.  I'm not letting what happened to me happen to you.
10,11,DEAN,But it's already happened.
10,11,SAM,Cain found a way to live with it.
10,11,DEAN,"Right.  Yeah, after centuries of murder."
10,11,CHARLIE,"Yeah, well, there's one thing that you have that he didn't.  You're a Winchester.  I forgive you, Dean."
10,11,DEAN,"Yeah, well, I don't."
10,11,CHARLIE,"I know.  Kind of your move.  How's that working out for you, huh?"
10,11,DEAN,"I'm so sorry, kiddo."
10,11,CHARLIE,Then prove it.
10,11,SAM,Be careful out there.
10,11,CHARLIE,"Does that sound like either of me?  If I find something, I'll call.  If not . . . I'll just keep digging."
10,11,SAM,"Charlie, thank you."
10,11,CHARLIE,"Arrivederci, bitches. (Charlie leaves up the stairs)"
10,11,SAM,You good?
10,11,DEAN,No.
10,11,SAM,"She's right, Dean.  You can do this.  We can do this."
10,11,DEAN,"Then let's get to work.  (Dean look at his hand, which is no longer shaking)"
10,11,CHARLIE,"Doesn't make it right though, does it?"
10,13,Julie,who are you?
10,13,PrincessElsa8,a friend
10,13,Julie,#curious. what’s up friend?
10,13,PrincessElsa8,"nm, liar"
10,13,Julie,#confused! What did I lie about?
10,13,PrincessElsa8,810
10,13,PrincessElsa8,I know.
10,13,PrincessElsa8,you’ll pay
10,13,QTPie Message,I’m bored.  Wanna hook up?
10,13,Kyle Message,Hells yeah! Come over STD.
10,13,QTPie Message,Guess we’re using condoms. LOL
10,13,Kyle Message,Don’t worry. I’m clean. But hope we can get dirty. Where r u?
10,13,8,10?
10,14,TRISH,What's your sin?
10,14,ROWENA,I was a horrible mother.
10,14,CROWLEY,You are shamelessly sucking up so that I'll free you so you can run amok and gum up my operation once again.
10,14,ROWENA,Who is there left for you to trust?
10,14,CAIN,You and I are very much alike.
10,14,DEAN,Except I didn't kill my brother.
10,14,CAIN,The Mark can be transferred to someone who's worthy.
10,14,CAIN,"But when I call you, use the Blade on me."
10,14,DEAN,"Don't you think if Cain knew how to remove the Mark, he'd have done it?"
10,14,DEAN,I'm done trying to find a cure.
10,14,SAM,Cas is so close.
10,14,DEAN,"Maybe Cas is onto something with Cain, but the answer is not out there.  It's with me."
10,14,DEAN,So I'm gonna fight it till I can't fight it anymore.
10,14,GUARD 1,Lights out in five.
10,14,INMATE,"Hey, any mail?"
10,14,GUARD 1,"Oh, the usual... postcards from anti-penalty folk, proposals from your lady admirers."
10,14,INMATE,"Hey, how's your wife, by the way... Amanda? That's her name, isn't it? You know I killed an Amanda once? My fourth. I'd do your wife the same, buddy, only slower."
10,14,GUARD 1,Two weeks from Tuesday Tommy.
10,14,TOMMY,"Yeah. Let's do it! Let's do it now, tonight!"
10,14,GUARD 2,Tolliver giving you the usual grief?
10,14,GUARD 1,Nothing new.
10,14,GUARD 2,I can't wait till he's gone.
10,14,TOMMY,Who the hell are you? How'd you get in here?!
10,14,CAIN,"I've gone by many names in this life. The father of murder is one of them. And by the state's count, you've taken six lives yourself, Tommy. Although by my count, it's nine."
10,14,CAIN,"Oh, come on. You aren't one of those ""it wasn't me"" type fellas, are you? [Tommy clenches his hand into a fist at his side.] Because I know you're a killer, just like me."
10,14,TOMMY,"Yeah, I did it."
10,14,CAIN,Honesty.
10,14,CAIN,That's good. That's the spirit!
10,14,TOMMY,Ugh!
10,14,CAIN,"Now, I bet you're wondering what I'm doing here. Did I come to punish you, or save you?"
10,14,DEAN,The Zodiac?
10,14,SAM,Seven victims.
10,14,DEAN,Dahmer?
10,14,SAM,Seventeen.
10,14,DEAN,"That's some freaky stuff, man. It's a whole new side of you."
10,14,SAM,"It's called true crime, Dean. It's a hobby."
10,14,DEAN,"No. Bass fishing, needlepoint ...that's a hobby, okay? Collecting serial-killer stats... that's... that is an illness."
10,14,DEAN,Get your badge.
10,14,SAM,Yeah.
10,14,DEAN,From the office of the Inspector General. Got an appointment with the warden.
10,14,DEAN,"All right, so what are the stats on this, uh, vanishing act here?"
10,14,SAM,"Tommy Tolliver was convicted of six murders back in '09, but those are just the ones that stuck. According to the news, he escaped from a locked cell on death row, this inexplicable, Houdini-esque escape."
10,14,DEAN,So what are we thinking? Some sort of a mass-murdering magician?
10,14,SAM,"Yeah, Or a teleporting demon or a who knows what that can walk through Supermax walls. Could be in our wheelhouse."
10,14,DEAN,"Yeah, your wheelhouse. ""Hobby."""
10,14,DEAN,Warden Skeiff?
10,14,SAM,"Uh, Inspectors Moore and Ranaldo. We spoke on the phone."
10,14,WARDEN,Yeah. Welcome to death row. Have a look.
10,14,WARDEN,But good luck finding anything out of TDJC compliance.
10,14,SAM,"So, why don't you tell me what happened?"
10,14,WARDEN,"The night Tolliver disappeared, our little ship was running as tight as ever, and I got documentation to prove it."
10,14,SAM,Do you stand by what the press is saying...
10,14,SAM,"...locked cell, no security breach, no guard misconduct?"
10,14,WARDEN,"Which press? Mainstream media is calling for my head, said I was grossly incompetent. But the tabloids, they're saying ..."
10,14,SAM,They're saying it's magic. That Tommy pulled off some dark miracle to escape. You saying you believe that?
10,14,WARDEN,"I'm saying there was some kind of magician on the block last night, but it wasn't Tommy."
10,14,WARDEN,That's right before Tolliver vanished.
10,14,SAM,Was that a brownout?
10,14,WARDEN,"That was my thought, but then..."
10,14,SAM,Is it one of the guards?
10,14,WARDEN,"Nope. But I don't know who he is, how he got in, or how he and Tolliver got out."
10,14,DEAN,Can you zoom in on that?
10,14,WARDEN,Can and have. Too dark to make out much of anything.
10,14,DEAN,"Do it. [Dean leans closer to the monitor as the guard zooms in] Freeze it.
Blow it up."
10,14,DEMON 1,"You're wasting your time. [Phone continues ringing in the background] I told you, I don't know where he is. Me and Cain ain't friends. He kills demons. Low-level guys like me keep our distance."
10,14,CASTIEL,You sure about that?
10,14,DEMON 1,All right! All right.
10,14,CASTIEL,And that's all you know.
10,14,DEMON 1,"Yes. Yes, I swear."
10,14,CASTIEL,Okay.
10,14,DEMON 1,Aaaaah!
10,14,DEMON 2,... while I only get credit for 48.
10,14,DEMON 2,A-and I was working with Alban on nearly all of those soul jobs.
10,14,CROWLEY,"[while playing video game, bored] If you don't arrive at a point within the next 10 seconds, so help me, I'll ..."
10,14,DEMON 2,"As a crossroads demon, I have received less credit than I am due for soul collections... my king."
10,14,CROWLEY,So you're looking for a promotion?
10,14,DEMON 2,No. I'm just asking... I'm merely suggesting that I get credit for the work that I did beside Alban. Equal credit for equal work.
10,14,CROWLEY,Fine. You can have your credit.
10,14,DEMON 2,Thank you.
10,14,ROWENA,The nerve of the wee man! Ugh!
10,14,CROWLEY,"Mother, you have, uh, an opinion you'd like to share with the room?"
10,14,ROWENA,"Oh, no. Private thought, nothing to do with you or the affairs of the court. [she sits back and then leans forward again] It's just not what I would do."
10,14,CROWLEY,"Oh, enlighten us all. What. Would. you do?"
10,14,ROWENA,"This demon asks you to equalize credit for his and another's work... split the baby, if you will. Well, (laughing) then I would well and truly split the baby."
10,14,CROWELY,That's enough.
10,14,CROWLEY,Let's do... What she said.
10,14,DEMON 2,"Wha... N-no, no, no!"
10,14,DEMON 2,"No, no, no, no! Come on!"
10,14,ROWENA,That's my boy.
10,14,SAM,So?
10,14,DEAN,Cas is still not answering.
10,14,SAM,"[sitting in the passenger seat with his laptop open] Great. Well, I have been looking into Tommy Tolliver, seeing if I can figure out why Cain went to the trouble of springing him."
10,14,DEAN,And?
10,14,SAM,"Still pretty unclear. I did find this blotter out of Orlando about his dad, Leon Tolliver. Uh, like father, like son. Convicted felon, fresh warrant for an assault charge, but he's gone missing, hasn't been seen in a week."
10,14,DEAN,You think the two are connected?
10,14,SAM,"I mean, the police just assumed he fled the warrant, but if Cain took Tommy, it might not be a coincidence."
10,14,DEAN,"So, what, Cain's got a vendetta against the entire family?"
10,14,SAM,Maybe.
10,14,DEAN,"It's Cas. [puts phone on speaker] Hey, where you at?"
10,14,CASTIEL,Illinois.
10,14,DEAN,"Hey, Cas, we got a lead. Cain abducted a Texas death row inmate named Tommy Tolliver."
10,14,CASTIEL,He's dead.
10,14,DEAN,What? How do you know?
10,14,CASTIEL,Call it an educated guess. Cain has been very busy.
10,14,DEAN,"Okay, where are you? We'll come to you."
10,14,CASTIEL,I'll call you back.
10,14,CAIN,"Hello, Castiel."
10,14,CASTIEL,What have you done?
10,14,CAIN,These bodies? Just cleaning up a mess I made a long time ago.
10,14,CASTIEL,"Cain, I know what you were. But you'd resisted for so long."
10,14,CAIN,"What can I say? I got the taste back. [Cain walks closer to Castiel as he talks] With Abaddon's army gunning for me, I had to take up arms again, and I liked how it felt."
10,14,CASTIEL,Those were demons. These...
10,14,CAIN,"Humans. Eh, the Mark thirsts for all kinds."
10,14,CASTIEL,This is a massacre.
10,14,CAIN,"Yes. And soon it'll be a genocide. [Cain drops the bear] My children, my whole poisoned issue. A lot of them out there right now... killers, fighters, thieves, some more peaceful than others. But they still carry it... the disease. If the Mark wants blood, I'll give it mine."
10,14,CASTIEL,You'll kill them all? You are Adam and Eve's firstborn. Your descendants are legion.
10,14,CAIN,"At most, I'm culling... 1 in 10."
10,14,CASTIEL,Of everyone.
10,14,CAIN,"I've got time. How's Dean, by the way? I hear he did good, took Abaddon down. [Castiel looks away] He's not well?"
10,14,CASTIEL,"Even with the First Blade hidden, Dean is losing his fight against the Mark. If we don't find a cure..."
10,14,CAIN,"There is no cure. I'm living proof of that. But don't worry about Dean. I'll get to him, in due time."
10,14,CAIN,"Sorry, Castiel. You're not on my list."
10,14,ROWENA,Crowley...
10,14,ROWENA,Long day. I'm sure you must be tired. But I've had a wee idea.
10,14,CROWLEY,Yes?
10,14,ROWENA,"The name Olivette means little to you. A high-ranking member of the grand coven, the one who led the charge against me. Really, it's a grudge, I won't even deny it, but... she's just come back to the states, and I thought if you, in your kingly beneficence, would be so kind as to assist me, now would be an excellent time to strike."
10,14,CROWLEY,"Well done, Mother. Next time you run a long con, let more than a few hours of suspicious, entirely uncharacteristic usefulness pass before making your ask."
10,14,ROWENA,"You think I had an ulterior motive, that I've been manipulating you?"
10,14,CROWLEY,You couldn't be more transparent.
10,14,ROWENA,"[laughs] Well, duh! Of course I was manipulating you! I am your mother, after all. Manipulation's who we are. Oh. My wee sausage [she holds the sides of Crowley's face], what matter is it that I had a motive? We had fun today, didn't we?"
10,14,CROWLEY,It was fine.
10,14,ROWENA,"We could have more. Get out of this dump, a break from these foul-smelling suck-ups, flex our muscles in the real world and in the process take out a miserable, old witch who's been standing in my way for centuries. What do you say?"
10,14,CASTIEL,"I'm sorry I couldn't bring better news, Dean."
10,14,DEAN,"It's not your fault, Cas."
10,14,SAM,"Thank you. [hangs up phone and sits down in front of his laptop] All right, the sheriff gave me a few more names, some preliminary I.D.s on the bodies."
10,14,DEAN,And?
10,14,SAM,"And it seems to fit Cas' story. I mean, there's no way to tell the relation to Cain, obviously, but he's wiping out entire families, one after another."
10,14,DEAN,[sighs] So who's next? Is he done with the Tollivers?
10,14,SAM,"Uh, I think so. I mean, Leon didn't have any siblings or any other children I can see, and Tommy was never married, so I... [Information scrolls on the computer screen] Oh, come on. Damn it."
10,14,CASTIEL,What?
10,14,SAM,"Tommy did have a son, estranged, who lives with his mother in Ohio, uh,..."
10,14,SAM,"Austin Reynolds, 12 years old."
10,14,DEAN,Is the kid still alive?
10,14,SAM,"As of an hour ago, yeah. He updated his status. But, I mean, come on. It's a kid. You don't really think Cain would ..."
10,14,CASTIEL,"Yes, he would."
10,14,DEAN,"There were old men in those graves, Sam, women. I mean, you heard Cas. It's a fire sale. Everyone must go."
10,14,SAM,Where you going?
10,14,DEAN,We know where Cain's gonna be. The kid's in danger.
10,14,SAM,"Okay, so what, we track him down to Ohio, and then what?"
10,14,DEAN,Then I'll do what I have to do.
10,14,DEAN,I'll kill Cain.
10,14,SAM,Great. So you're taking orders from a madman.
10,14,DEAN,"No, he wasn't mad then."
10,14,DEAN,"Cain resisted the Mark for a long time, then I came, kicking up trouble about the Blade. I sent him down this path. This is on me."
10,14,SAM,It doesn't mean you have to be the one to go after him.
10,14,DEAN,"Yes, it does. And there's only one thing that can kill him."
10,14,SAM,The Blade.
10,14,CASTIEL,Dean's right.
10,14,SAM,"Dean, wielding the Blade against Cain himself... [Dean closes his hand over the Mark] Win or lose, you may never come back from that fight."
10,14,DEAN,I know.
10,14,ROWENA,"I'll need a demon force to get us past her security. 2 units of 10 should suffice. Once we're inside, we'll want to throw her off guard, mess with her head a little bit. So I thought... [Rowena holds up a small dark amber colored bottle] Rune of Amaranth."
10,14,CROWLEY,Illusion work. Smart.
10,14,CROWLEY,"Excuse me. I'll be right back. [Crowley walks away and picks up the call] Well, well, well, if it isn't..."
10,14,DEAN,"[in his room in the Bunker] Cain's back. He's gone dark, and I need the Blade."
10,14,CROWLEY,Why would I do that for you?
10,14,DEAN,"Because you have as much reason to want Cain off the board as anyone. Cain has a kill list, and you're on it. [Dean raises his eyebrows at someone off screen] What do you say, Crowley? You in?"
10,14,CROWLEY,Yes.
10,14,DEAN,Good. I'll text you the location.
10,14,ROWENA,"Once she's well flustered, I've got an especially nasty spell to finish her off with."
10,14,CROWLEY,"Mother, it's not happening."
10,14,ROWENA,What?
10,14,CROWLEY,Not today.
10,14,ROWENA,Where are you going?
10,14,CROWLEY,Something's come up. Olivette can wait.
10,14,CROWLEY,This can't.
10,14,ROWENA,Is that what I think it is?!
10,14,CROWLEY,Not that it's any of your business.
10,14,ROWENA,"Let me guess. Bringing it to your wee pal, the Winchester boy. You'd give that to the one person who can harness its power against you. He's a threat to you!"
10,14,CROWLEY,"We've a common enemy, a bigger threat."
10,14,ROWENA,"Well, if he's not a threat to your life, he's certainly a threat to your credibility. We've talked about what this does to your reputation."
10,14,CROWLEY,We are not having this conversation.
10,14,ROWENA,"Consorting with hunters! Oh, me. Oh, my."
10,14,ROWENA,"You honestly believe that they're your friends, that they care about you?!"
10,14,DEAN,Kid here?
10,14,CASTIEL,He's nearby. Upstairs in the barn. He's playing with a basketball.
10,14,DEAN,"Cain will strike soon. Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow, but soon. [Dean looks over to Sam] And when he does ..."
10,14,SAM,"Yeah, I got it. You charge in with the Blade solo. And the kid? What, we just watch and wait until Cain attacks? I thought this was a rescue mission."
10,14,DEAN,We save the kid after Cain shows.
10,14,CASTIEL,"We know what Cain's after. That's our only advantage. We want to trap Cain, we use it."
10,14,SAM,A 12-year-old as bait. I can’t believe what I'm hearing.
10,14,DEAN,"What's the matter, Crowley? You suddenly grow a conscience? Too good to put a minor in danger?"
10,14,CROWLEY,Don't give a damn about the kid. I'm talking about the risk to us.
10,14,DEAN,There is no us. You're here for one reason. That's to hand me the Blade.
10,14,CROWLEY,"Yeah, about that. Seeing as this is shaping up to be one of those, uh, two-step capture then kill kind of deals, I think your buddies would agree it's better to keep the Blade out of your hands until we've got Cain sewn up, just to be safe."
10,14,CROWLEY,"Now, back to this plan of yours."
10,14,SAM,"So... If this works and we capture Cain, then what?"
10,14,DEAN,We'll cross that bridge when we c... If we come to it.
10,14,AUSTIN,Someone there?
10,14,CAIN,"Hello, Austin."
10,14,AUSTIN,What are you doing here?
10,14,CAIN,I'm here to kill you.
10,14,CASTIEL,"No, you won't. Run!"
10,14,CAIN,You can't stop me.
10,14,AUSTIN,[flatly] Don't. Please don't.
10,14,CAIN,Illusion spell.
10,14,SAM,"Oh, yeah. The real Austin is long gone."
10,14,CAIN,18th-century magic.
10,14,CAIN,"If I had to hazard a guess, Rune of Amaranth."
10,14,CROWLEY,Good eye. Something I picked up from my mother.
10,14,CAIN,"Well, I know you fear me. I can only assume..."
10,14,CAIN,"Oh. Clever. Won't hold me for long, you know."
10,14,SAM,It won't need to.
10,14,SAM ,"Cas, hey, you okay?"
10,14,CASTIEL,I'm fine. It worked?
10,14,SAM,Yeah.
10,14,DEAN,My turn.
10,14,SAM,"Dean, look, we want to help."
10,14,DEAN,"No. No, with you in the ring, it'd just be a liability."
10,14,CASTIEL,Dean?
10,14,DEAN,"I'd be too worried about what he could do to you... Or what I could. Plus, I need you three out here to take out whatever comes out of there. And I'm serious. I mean whatever comes out."
10,14,CROWLEY,Happily.
10,14,CROWLEY,What guarantee do I have that you'll give it back when you're done?
10,14,DEAN,"If I survive and I come out of there and I don't give it back, you'll all have a much bigger problem on your hands."
10,14,SAM,Dean?
10,14,DEAN,I'm good.
10,14,CAIN,"Hello, Dean."
10,14,DEAN,"I'll spare us the formalities. You're past talking down. Cain, you're fully mental."
10,14,CAIN,"Oh, I prefer to think I've finally gotten clear."
10,14,CAIN,"When I made my bargain with Lucifer, killed Abel, I released a stain upon the earth, a stain deeper and far more lasting than mere precedence."
10,14,DEAN,"Your bloodline's tainted, so you say."
10,14,CAIN,"So I know. [Cain stops walking] Not all killers are my descendants, and not all my descendants are killers, but enough are, enough for me to know that extinguishing them is the least I owe this world. Can you honestly tell me that humanity's not better off with fewer Tommy’s and fewer Leon’s... Fewer you’s?"
10,14,DEAN,And what about the kid?
10,14,CAIN,He could go either way. I prefer to be thorough.
10,14,CAIN,"How's it feel, Dean, to be holding the Blade again?"
10,14,DEAN,It feels like a means to an end.
10,14,CAIN,Then do it.
10,14,CAIN,That seems a bit weaker than I would expect from you with the Blade. [Cain looks Dean in the eyes.] I think you can do better.
10,14,CAIN,Unless...
10,14,CAIN,You're holding back.
10,14,CAIN,"What is it, Dean? Do you think if you hold back just enough, you won't succumb? That you'll leave this fight the same as you entered?!"
10,14,CAIN,"[yelling] Look to my example, boy! There is no resisting the Mark or the Blade. There is only remission and relapse!"
10,14,DEAN,You told me that this day would come. You told me that I would have to kill you.
10,14,CAIN,Is that so?
10,14,CAIN,"I'm afraid you've misunderstood my intentions here, Dean. When your pet angel found my burial site, I thought about ending him and swatting him like a fly. [Dean gets up and looks around] But then I thought about you. Your biggest weakness, the thing I noticed the moment I met you, your courage, your reckless bravado."
10,14,CAIN,"I let him go, knowing that he would report back to you, knowing you would bring into battle the one thing that can kill me, the one thing I truly want."
10,14,CAIN,"Oh, it's been too long. [inhales] That old feeling makes me wonder how I ever had the strength to resist."
10,14,CAIN,"This may be hard to believe, in light of what I'm about to do to you, but I care about you, Dean. I truly do. But I know I'm doing you a favor. I'm saving you."
10,14,DEAN,[choking] Saving me from what?
10,14,CAIN,From your fate.
10,14,CAIN,"Has it never occurred to you? [Cain kicks Dean onto his back] Have you never mused upon the fact that you're living my life in reverse? My story began when I killed my brother, and that's where your story inevitably will end."
10,14,DEAN,No. Never.
10,14,CAIN,"[stomps on Dean's chest] It's called the Mark of Cain for a reason. First ... first, you'd kill Crowley. There'd be some strange, mixed feelings on that one, but you'd have your reason. You'd get it done, no remorse."
10,14,CAIN,"Then would come the murder you'd never survive, the one that would finally turn you into as much of a savage as it did me."
10,14,DEAN,No.
10,14,CAIN,"Your brother, Sam. The only thing standing between you and that destiny is this Blade. You're welcome, my son."
10,14,CAIN,What's the matter?
10,14,DEAN,[tearfully] Tell me I don't have to do this. Tell me that you'll stop. Tell me that you can stop!
10,14,CAIN,I will never stop.
10,14,SAM,Dean?
10,14,CROWLEY,"Dean, the Blade."
10,14,CROWLEY,You lied to me.
10,14,DEAN,It's not the first time today. Cain's list ... you weren't on it.
10,14,SAM,"Hey, hey, hey. You did it. Dean, you did it."
10,14,ROWENA,Fergus...
10,14,CROWLEY,"I don't want to hear it, the I-told-you-so's, not now."
10,14,CROWLEY,What are you doing?
10,14,ROWENA,What's it look like? I'm leaving.
10,14,CROWLEY,Another petty manipulation.
10,14,ROWENA,No.
10,14,CROWLEY,"Then what, mother? [yelling] What do you want from me?!"
10,14,ROWENA,"[crying] You can't understand my disappointment... or my pride. [Crowley scoffs] You don't know this, but after I left you, after I was forced to leave you... I heard of your death, your mortal death. I thought you were gone to me forever. Then, hundreds of years later and thousands of miles away, I find you, the King of Hell. [Crowley smiles slightly] And not by luck or accident. You made that happen. All by yourself."
10,14,ROWENA,"You're no king, not anymore. [Crowley grabs her by the wrist, forcing her to drop the bags. She turns back to him.] You're their bitch."
10,14,SAM,"Dean, um, you know, what you did back there... it was incredible. You know, if you can do that without losing yourself... [Sam sits at the table across from Dean] that's cause for hope, even without a cure."
10,14,DEAN,Yeah. Maybe.
10,14,DEAN,"So, where's the Blade?"
10,14,CASTIEL,Somewhere safe.
10,14,DEAN,"Good. Well, if you guys will excuse me, I think I am gonna go sleep for about four days."
10,14,SAM,Of course.
10,14,CASTIEL,How is he? Sam?
10,14,SAM,Cas...
10,14,SAM,Dean's in trouble.
10,14,CROWLEY,Hmm. (looking up at DEAN) Not my type.
10,15,Int. Bunker,"the library.  The camera opens on Sam’s computer screen, where he’s researching “Biblical and Far East Studies.”  Dean enters and Sam quickly closes his computer, a bit guiltily."
10,15,DEAN,"Hey, check it out."
10,15,SAM,Hey.
10,15,DEAN,Porn?
10,15,SAM,What?  No. l-it's nothing.
10,15,DEAN,"Hey, look, no judgement from me.  Just, you know, not where we eat."
10,15,SAM,"Dude, it wasn't porn."
10,15,DEAN,"Okay, ""erotica.""  Whatever.  Zip it up.  Check this out. (hands Sam his tablet with an article about a soldier who has died)  The vic was trained in Krav Maga and jiu-jitsu.  Still ended up with her organs drained, and the marrow was sucked completely out of the bones."
10,15,SAM,So...cannibalism.  You thinking a Rugaru?
10,15,DEAN,"Or a God, maybe.  I'Il go dig up my pencil-neck suit."
10,15,SAM,"Wait, wait, wait. W-what?"
10,15,SAM,"Well, yeah, it's weird, but, um, l mean, we . . . we . . . I mean . . ."
10,15,DEAN,Great. 10 minutes.  I'Il meet you in the car.
10,15,SAM,Great.
10,15,Int. Impala,"Sam and Dean are driving.  Dean’s driving, and Sam’s on his cell phone."
10,15,DEAN,"Sam!  I know what you're doing over there, and it ain't porn.  Look, man, we have checked every website, okay?  We've checked it twice.  Sammy, when we work a case, there's always that . . . that point . . . when we have to face the truth, right?  Even if we don't like it.  Well, truth is . . . (Dean holds his arm out, indicating the Mark of Cain) there's no way"
10,15,SHERIFF,"Agents, l gather."
10,15,DEAN,"Uh, was it the suits, or do we give off some sort of a Fed stench?"
10,15,SHERIFF,I-it's the suits.  What can l do for you boys?
10,15,SAM,"Well, uh, we are here investigating the death of private Jackie Prescott."
10,15,SHERIFF,Shoot. You drove all the way down from D.C.?
10,15,DEAN,Mm-hmm.
10,15,SAM,"Yeah, we did."
10,15,DEAN,What makes you so sure it was him?
10,15,SHERIFF,(pulling out the murder file) His fingerprints were all over the storage room out on the base where he did it.  He even left his dog tags by the body.
10,15,SAM,"So, is he in custody?"
10,15,SHERIFF,"No, bastard drank a boatload of gasoline, then lit himself on fire."
10,15,DEAN,"Well, that's a hell of a way to go."
10,15,SHERIFF,No kidding.  Left a wife and a baby.  Third suicide we seen in six months.  Military town.  Would you like some cake?
10,15,DEAN,Mm. Yeah.
10,15,SAM,"(cutting off Dean’s access to the cake) No, uh, y-you know what?  Uh, we're okay."
10,15,SHERIFF,"No, it's really good.  My partner made it."
10,15,SAM,"It looks great, but we're . . . no, we're all right.  Uh, we do have one more question.  Were there any bite marks found on the body?"
10,15,SHERIFF,No. Vic was killed with a Bowie.
10,15,DEAN,"Well, sheriff, thank you for your time."
10,15,SAM,Yeah.
10,15,SAM,No bite marks.  That rules out Rugaru.  So what? A God?
10,15,DEAN,I don't like the sound of that.  The guy Molotov-cocktailed himself.  That's bonkers.  That's like demon-possession bonkers.
10,15,BETH,"Rick did it.  I'm not trying to say that he didn't.  But . . . I mean, he just got back from deployment, and we've all seen what it can do to a soldier's mind.  My Rick . . . when he's home and good . . . I have to kill the spiders, you know?  Rick was a kind soul.  He never took more life than he had to."
10,15,SAM,"Did you, um, notice anything strange, weird, like, uh . . . violent mood swings?  Or weird smells?"
10,15,BETH,No. But . . . Rick was . . . he was so . . . He was thirsty.
10,15,DEAN,Thirsty for what?
10,15,BETH,"Water.  He'd spend half the day drinking from the garden hose.  And then, one night, I caught him in the tub drinking the bathwater.  When l told him to stop, it was like he couldn't even hear me.  And his skin, it got so dry it bled."
10,15,DEAN,Did he see a doctor?
10,15,BETH,"I took him to the V.A., but he just got on a list to get on a list.  And then, he stopped talking . . . And just wasn't himself.  I thought maybe it was PTSD."
10,15,SAM,"Uh, we're very sorry."
10,15,DEAN,You said that Rick was recently deployed.  Do you have any idea where?
10,15,BETH,"No, that stuff is classified.  They don't even let the wives in on it."
10,15,SAM,"Right.  Okay, well, we'Il, um . . . We'Il leave you alone now, but if something comes up, anything at all, just give us a call."
10,15,BETH,"There's one other thing.  I ran into my friend Jemma at the supermarket.  She's married to Kit Verson, a guy from Rick's team.  She thinks Kit came back different this time.  Kind of felt like we were dealing with the same thing."
10,15,SAM,Thank you.
10,15,JEMMA,"Kit's been going through some stuff for sure.  Um, you know, it takes him a while to get back to normal, but he always does. (She hands both Sam and Dean a beverage)"
10,15,SAM,Thanks.
10,15,DEAN,And what about you?  How are you holding up?
10,15,JEMMA,"I'm okay . . . For the most part.  You know, what happened to Rick and Beth, it . . . It's been hard.  ""There but for the grace of God,"" you know?"
10,15,SAM,Um. . . May we speak with your husband?
10,15,JEMMA,"He, um . . . He went out last night, but he should be back any minute.  You know, Kit, he comes back from these deployments, and he needs his space."
10,15,DEAN,So he's been out all night?
10,15,JEMMA,Well . . . Yeah (the brothers share a look) . . . God.  I can't even convince myself.  Um. . . I'm worried.  This isn't like him.
10,15,SAM,"Has he been thirsty?  Like ""drink out of the dog bowl"" thirsty?"
10,15,JEMMA,How did you know?
10,15,COLE,Recognized your wheels.
10,15,DEAN,What the hell are you doing here?
10,15,COLE,Jemma called me in.  I've known Kit since we were military brats raisin' hell on the same base.  He's a good man.
10,15,DEAN,"Well, no one's saying he's not."
10,15,COLE,"Oh, really, now?  So, what are you two, uh, here for, Jemma's sweet tea?  You want to tell me why you're really here?"
10,15,SAM,We're working a case.
10,15,COLE,"Oh, Kit's case?"
10,15,SAM,"Honestly, we're not sure just yet, but, um, it's looking like it."
10,15,COLE,Mm. Says you.
10,15,DEAN,There's a murder-suicide in town.  Your buddy Kit?  Same unit as the killer.  Same whacked-out antics.  So . . .
10,15,SAM,"Look, we're not going anywhere, all right?  And if you care about your buddy, you'Il let us handle this."
10,15,COLE,"Mm.  Nah, l think I'm gonna be coming with you."
10,15,DEAN,"Oh, the hell you are."
10,15,COLE,I got contacts. I can help.
10,15,DEAN,You really can't.
10,15,COLE,"For example, a friend of mine works military intelligence . . . owes me a favor."
10,15,SAM,Would he know what Rick and Kit's mission was?
10,15,COLE,Sure. And he'd tell me all about it.
10,15,DEAN,"Okay, fine."
10,15,COLE,"No, it ain't.  You know, l figure what's going on here . . . I stick to you two like flies on roadkill, make sure my buddy comes home in one piece.  Look, l know what you two are thinking, but we are not gonna hunt my best friend, who happens to be a friggin’ war hero, by the way.  We are gonna find him.  And that's the difference."
10,15,DEAN,"Hey, man, we're right there with you, okay?  Kit's a hero, but..."
10,15,SAM,But you got to prepare yourself.  Kit might not be Kit anymore.
10,15,Int. Gas’n’Sip,"The scene opens with a man staggering into a Gas’n’Sip, grabbing a bottle of water, guzzling part of it, then throwing it down in favor of a larger bottle in a cooler at the back of the store.  The man looks extremely sick, and the clerks are unsure of what to do."
10,15,CLERK 1,"(Appriaching the man guzzling water) Uh, sir?  Sir, you have to pay for that first!  Hey!  (Knocks the water bottle out of his hand) Now, look what you ma . . .Whoa! (exclamation after the man, Kit, smashes a wine bottle and cuts the clerk with it)"
10,15,CLERK 2,"This guy just came in.  Get to the store, man."
10,15,SAM,Yo. Sustenance.
10,15,DEAN,"Listen, l got nothing on cattle deaths, freakish weather . . . none of it."
10,15,SAM,So . . . Probably not a demon.
10,15,COLE,So maybe it's just not your kind of thing at all.
10,15,DEAN,"Well, when in doubt . . . eat."
10,15,COLE,"Okay, here we go.  I got an encrypted e-mail here from my friend at the M.I."
10,15,SAM,And?
10,15,COLE,Well . . . Kit and Rick were sent to rescue an American P.O.W.  Being held in Iraq . . . the Najaf cemetery.
10,15,DEAN,Cemetery?
10,15,COLE,"Bastards use 'em as a, uh . . . as a prison.  I got some footage here from the camera on Willis' helmet during his last mission with Kit."
10,15,VIDEO,"Okay, go!  Down. Get down.  Clear.  Major Jones?!  Major Matt Jones?  Hey, right here.  Hey, Major Jones, is that you?  Hey.  Hey, I'm captain Kit Verson.  We're here to bring you home, man.  Oh, what the hell?!  What the hell was that?!"
10,15,DEAN,I'm guessing that didn't have a happy ending.
10,15,COLE,"No, it did not.  Mission failed.  And that P.O.W. got shot by guards."
10,15,SAM,Really?  That's what happened?
10,15,COLE,That's the official story.
10,15,DEAN,"All right, so, Kit and Rick came back screwed-up.  We know that much."
10,15,COLE,"Well, and then Rick jumped the high dive.  God, Kit."
10,15,DEAN,(referring Sam’s phone ringing) What was that?
10,15,SAM,I set my phone to get local alerts.
10,15,COLE,Is it bad?
10,15,SAM,It's bloody.
10,15,DEAN,"All right, let's get out of here."
10,15,COLE,He licked the blood off the floor?
10,15,DEAN,"Yeah, the soda jockey back there seemed pretty shook up by it."
10,15,SAM,"Now, the description he gave . . . medium build, brown hair . . . that sound like the Kit you know?"
10,15,COLE,"Yeah, it does."
10,15,SAM,Great.
10,15,DEAN,This still sound like it ain't our kind of thing?
10,15,COLE,"(Answering his phone) Hey, Jem."
10,15,JEMMA,"Cole, uh, the news said someone was killed at the Gas’n’Sip on Kenton."
10,15,COLE,"Yeah, l know.  I'm here right now."
10,15,JEMMA,You are?  W-what are they saying?
10,15,COLE,"Not much. Look, Jem.  Um, l really can't talk right now.  I'm sorry."
10,15,JEMMA,Wait.  Do they think that he . . . that . . . that Kit . . . Did this?
10,15,COLE,I don't know.
10,15,JEMMA,"If he did, he isn't in his right mind, and you know that, Cole.  You got to save him."
10,15,COLE,I will.
10,15,JEMMA,"I know. And, uh . . . And that's the only thing keeping me sane right now. I was thinking, you know, sometimes, when Kit wanted to be alone, he would head up north to his dad's old cabin.  Maybe you could go check it out, and . . . and . . . and l'Il stay here"
10,15,COLE,Right.
10,15,DEAN,"Hey, Kung-Fu grip, you coming?"
10,15,COLE,"Hey, Jem, l got to go."
10,15,SAM,"So, what next?"
10,15,DEAN,"We hit every cop shop within a 10-mile radius, put the word out, see if we can't track him down."
10,15,COLE,"And if you find him, what then?  Kit needs help.  He doesn't need a bullet, and he doesn't need a knife."
10,15,SAM,"Okay.  You know what, Cole?  We know you want to protect your buddy, but . . ."
10,15,DEAN,If he's a monster . . . we got to put him down.
10,15,COLE,"That's the way it's gonna have to be, huh?"
10,15,DEAN,"That's the job.  So, you in or out?"
10,15,COLE,Thanks for the lift.
10,15,DEAN,"It's better this way, all right?  You keep her calm.  We'Il keep you posted."
10,15,COLE,Yeah.
10,15,DEAN,"Hey, Cole.  He shows up, don't try and be a hero.  Call us."
10,15,COLE,"You got it. (Cole waits until the Winchesters drive away, and then he gets in his truck and leaves Jemma’s)"
10,15,DEAN,And you bought him dinner.
10,15,COLE,"Kit?  Hey, Kit?  Are you here?  It's Cole.  There's some real serious people"
10,15,KIT,I'm sorry. l can't stop. (Kit attacks Cole just like the soldier from the video.  We see Khan worms drop out of his mouth.)
10,15,COLE,Aah! (swallowing a Khan worm from Kit)
10,15,DEAN,"Wait, wait, wait! (Kit throws Dean across the room and runs out of the cabin)"
10,15,COLE,"Oh, god.  Oh, God.  Ew.  Something went down my . . . throat."
10,15,SAM,"All right, Cole, just try and stay calm."
10,15,COLE,"Oh, God."
10,15,SAM,Cole?
10,15,COLE,"Something moved.  It's alive, Sammy."
10,15,SAM,"All right, well, we're gonna get it out of you, okay?"
10,15,COLE,How?!
10,15,SAM,We'Il figure it out.  We . . .
10,15,DEAN,"Man, that was a dumbass move coming here alone.  You know that, right?"
10,15,COLE,"Oh, l'm sorry. l should have let the machete brothers cut my buddy's head off."
10,15,DEAN,"Well, if you did, maybe you wouldn't be chokin’ down a damn Khan worm right now."
10,15,COLE,What's a Khan worm?
10,15,SAM,You think that's what it is?
10,15,DEAN,Or some sort of freak cousin.
10,15,COLE,Freak cousin of what?
10,15,SAM,"A couple years back, Dean and l worked a case.  We got stuck in a cannery with this worm.  It would get into people's bodies and . . ."
10,15,DEAN,It was freaking awful.
10,15,COLE,"All right, so you've been to this rodeo before. How do we kill it?"
10,15,DEAN,"Worst case . . . headshot the person it's in.  Worm crawls out, we stomp it like a bug."
10,15,COLE,Is there a version where you don't cap me?
10,15,SAM,"Yeah, uh, last time, electrocution made the worm leave the body."
10,15,COLE,"All right, fine.  Electrocution it is. l'm game."
10,15,SAM,All right.  You two get to work.  I'Il go look for Kit.
10,15,COLE,"Hey, hey, Sammy?"
10,15,SAM,Yeah.
10,15,COLE,"If we can fix me, we can save Kit, right?"
10,15,SAM,That's the idea.
10,15,COLE,Mm.
10,15,DEAN,You know that this is gonna hurt like a son of a bitch?
10,15,COLE,"Hell, l have a wife, a kid, and an upside-down mortgage to get back to.  Whatever it takes, Dean-o."
10,15,DEAN,Okay.
10,15,COLE,"Mm.  So, last time you saw this thing, it turned people into killers, too?"
10,15,DEAN,"Yeah, except that one did a mind-control number on us. (Starts putting jumper cables on a car battery.)"
10,15,COLE,"Damn.  Day in, day out, you and Sammy saving people from things they just can't wrap their minds around . . .  Hell, and nobody even notices it.  Hell, at least l get a medal for my efforts.  But you . . . I tried to kill your ass."
10,15,DEAN,"Yeah, well, good times."
10,15,COLE,I almost took you off the map.  Who would be saving me now?
10,15,DEAN,"Yeah, well, let's not get too sentimental about it.  All right, let's fire this puppy up."
10,15,COLE,"Well, you say that like it's just another Tuesday."
10,15,DEAN,"Oh, buddy, it's only Monday (snaps the jumper cables together so they spark)."
10,15,COLE,Anything?
10,15,DEAN,"Last time, it came out of our ears."
10,15,COLE,And . . . ?
10,15,DEAN,I'm not seeing anything yet.
10,15,COLE,Do it again.
10,15,DEAN,"(stops shocking Cole) All right, that sucker should have crawled out by now."
10,15,COLE,Again.
10,15,DEAN,"I keep going, this is gonna kill you."
10,15,COLE,Again!
10,15,DEAN,"(Starts taking Cole’s pulse, and then slapping his chest to get his heart started again.) Cole. Hey, hey. Cole! Come on. Come on.  Cole!  Hey."
10,15,COLE,Hey! Hey! Okay! Hey.  All right. Again.
10,15,DEAN,"No. No, we're done playing ""Operation.""  I zap you again, you're toast.  Just take a knee."
10,15,SAM,Dean.  How did it go?
10,15,DEAN,Worm was a no-show.
10,15,SAM,That doesn't make any sense.  Last time . . .
10,15,DEAN,"Well, this ain't the last time.  I mean, maybe this is a whole new species, you know?  All I know is that sparky struck out."
10,15,SAM,"Well, there's got to be something.  I mean, everything has a weakness, right?"
10,15,DEAN,"Well, what about you? Any luck?"
10,15,SAM,I'm on my way to Kit's.  Thought l'd check there first.
10,15,DEAN,"All right, well . . . Hurry up, man."
10,15,SAM,You got it.
10,15,DEAN,You okay?
10,15,COLE,So this is what in over your head looks like.
10,15,DEAN,"Just got to keep your head in the game.  Okay, what do we know about this thing?"
10,15,COLE,"Uh, sucker dries you out.  I'm thirsty already, man."
10,15,DEAN,It likes water.  Then when that's not enough . . .
10,15,COLE,Blood. l don't know.  Maybe lack of fluids makes the thing hostile.
10,15,DEAN,"So it's like a parasite.  It wrings you dry, and then it moves on."
10,15,COLE,"So if l dry myself out, the son of a bitch wouldn't like that very much, now, would he?"
10,15,DEAN,"No, he'd want the hell out.  You'd be a hostile environment . . . well, more than you already are."
10,15,COLE,"Well, to be fair, you really haven't seen my chiller side."
10,15,DEAN,What do you think about rapid dehydration?
10,15,COLE,Big fan.  Just make sure you squash that sucker when it goes AWOL.
10,15,DEAN,Sounds like a plan.
10,15,DEAN,"All right.  Nothing like a sweat lodge in the woods, huh?"
10,15,JEMMA,"Kit?  Honey.  Look at me.  What's happened to you?  Listen.  Whatever happened, whatever you . . . You did . . . We're gonna fix this, okay?  We're gonna get you well.  Baby."
10,15,KIT,"I can't . . . stop. (He leans forward and a Kahn worm starts inching its way out of Kit’s mouth towards Jemma.  The flower vase smashes over Kit’s head, knocking him unconscious, and the camera pans up to who Sam standing over Jemma."
10,15,SAM,Are you okay?
10,15,SAM,You're in a . . . Sweat lodge?
10,15,DEAN,"Well, you're the one who said everything has got a weakness.  So l figure take a schvitz, kill a freak.  Call that a good day."
10,15,SAM,"Yeah, if it works."
10,15,DEAN,"Well, you got a better idea?"
10,15,SAM,"Yeah, l do, actually, Dean.  We know how to end this."
10,15,DEAN,"Yeah, plan ""B"" for ""bullet.""  But we're not quite there yet, so just hold tight."
10,15,SAM,All right.
10,15,DEAN,How's the wife?
10,15,SAM,She's barely holding on.  How's Cole?
10,15,DEAN,He's going strong.
10,15,SAM,"Good.  Look, Dean, Kit is gonna come to.  And when l got here, it was bad."
10,15,DEAN,We're on the clock.  I get it.
10,15,SAM,Yeah.
10,15,DEAN,"Just keep sweating, man.  You're doing great. (Dean opens a water bottle and takes a swig.  Cole eyes the water with open hunger.)  Sorry."
10,15,JEMMA,I don't understand.
10,15,SAM,"On Kit's last mission, on his deployment with Rick, there was an incident, and something got inside Kit.  I mean, h-have you seen anything?"
10,15,JEMMA,"I mean, y . . . I saw something okay?  But it . . . it was . . ."
10,15,SAM,"It was a monster.  It was a real-life, actual, honest-to-god monster.  And your husband . . . it changed him."
10,15,JEMMA,What?  Who are you?
10,15,COLE,"My dad . . . He got something inside him, too, right?  You think this is what he felt like when he turned?"
10,15,DEAN,"Maybe.  I mean, he was human before he was . . . a monster."
10,15,COLE,"I get it . . . Why you did it, Dean.  My dad wasn't my dad anymore.  If l go down that same road . . . I want you to do that to me, too."
10,15,DEAN,"That road?  That means giving up.  If you think that's where you're headed, then you've got it ass-backwards.  You're gonna fight harder than you ever have.  You understand?"
10,15,COLE,"(Cole watches Dean drink some water, and something in his expression changes.  He stands up and walks over to a chair.)  Dean-o.  Will you do me the honor of tying me to this chair?"
10,15,DEAN,(Looks at his water) Yeah.  (He sets his water bottle down on the table to go get some rope.)
10,15,COLE/DEAN,"(As Dean starts tying Cole to the chair, Cole punches him and lunges for the water.) Aah!"
10,15,COLE,(Dean slaps the water out of his hand and holds him down at gunpoint.) Come on. We both know you're not gonna do it.
10,15,DEAN,You are gonna sweat this one through.
10,15,COLE,"I can't, Dean!"
10,15,DEAN,"Yes, you can.  Listen to me. Yes, you can.  Think about your family, hmm?  Your wife, your kid.  You hear me?"
10,15,COLE,"I appreciate the talk, coach.  But honestly, all l can think about is slicing your wrist and drinking you like a fountain. (Dean jerks his hand away from Cole’s shoulder)  Guess that makes me a monster, don't it?"
10,15,JEMMA,"So, you're a hunter."
10,15,SAM,Right.
10,15,JEMMA,"And . . . I'm sorry. This is gonna take me a minute.  It's, uh . . ."
10,15,SAM,"It's crazy, right?  It sounds crazy? l know.  But it's the truth."
10,15,JEMMA,"I don't care if he's what you say he is, okay?  He's my husband. (While Jemma is talking, the camera pans to Kit waking up in the kitchen.)"
10,15,SAM,"Jemma, he tried to kill you.  Was that your husband when you looked into his eyes?  Was that the Kit you know?  Look . . . Dean is working on it.  Dean and Cole will figure it out, okay?  Let me check in with them."
10,15,JEMMA,"All right.  Sam.  Sam. (Jemma looks into the kitchen while Sam’s getting his phone out, and she sees that Kit has gotten free and disappeared.  The lights in the house go out.) Sam.  (Sam puts his finger to his mouth to tell Jemma to be quiet as he stalks into the kitchen.  He also tells Jemma to wait where she is.  Kit sneaks up behind her, Jemma screams, and Sam jumps on Kit.  A fight ensues with Sam and Kit fighting for the gun while Kit chokes Sam on the floor.  Sam’s phone starts ringing.)"
10,15,DEAN,"Come on, Sammy! Pick up! (Cole is coughing by the fire.  He leaps on Dean and pins Dean on the table.  Dean’s got his gun out and trained on Cole’s head.)  Don't make me pull this trigger."
10,15,COLE,I already did. (Cole throws his head back and the Kahn worm can be seen moving up his throat under his skin.)
10,15,DEAN,"Holy . . . (Dean throws Cole off of him, and he throws up the Kahn worm.  Dean stomps on it with his boot)"
10,15,DEAN,You okay?
10,15,COLE,"Yeah. Oh, thank God.  Thank God."
10,15,SAM,Hey.
10,15,DEAN,"Sammy, we did it.  Cole's all right.  Get Kit over here as soon as you can."
10,15,SAM,"It's too late. (Jemma’s on the floor of their kitchen, cradling Kit, who has a bullet hole in his head.)"
10,15,SAM,"Hey, Cole.  Listen, uh, l, uh . . . For whatever it's worth . . . I really wish it hadn't ended this way."
10,15,COLE,"Yeah, me, too, Sammy boy."
10,15,SAM,"I mean, Kit . . . he was gonna kill her and . . ."
10,15,COLE,"I know.  Jemma told me everything.  Solider goes crazy, attacks his wife.  She had to kill him.  Or at least that's the story that she's got to tell.  I guess I've seen it all now."
10,15,DEAN,Some. Not all.
10,15,COLE,"I just want to go home, see my family.  I want to thank you, Dean-o, for keeping me standing."
10,15,DEAN,"Well, all it took was a little blood, sweat, and, uh, more sweat.  You take care of yourself, you hear?"
10,15,COLE,"All right, l will.  But l still hope l don't see the two of you anymore.  No offense."
10,15,SAM,None taken. (Cole gets in his Jeep and drives away.)
10,15,DEAN,"Don't blame yourself for Kit, man."
10,15,SAM,"I can't help it, Dean.  It feels crappy."
10,15,DEAN,I know it does.
10,15,SAM,I tried. l did.  I tried. l just . . . I couldn't save this one.
10,15,DEAN,"You know, you can do everything right.  And even still, sometimes . . . The guy still dies."

10,17,Int. Bunker,Sam’s bedroom.  Sam is awakened by Dean screaming for him.
10,17,DEAN,Sam!
10,17,DEAN,No.  No!  No!  No.  No!
10,17,METATRON,Aah!
10,17,CAIN,"(Cain’s words echo through Dean’s head in his dream.) My story began when I killed my brother, and that's where your story inevitably will end."
10,17,SAM,"Yeah.  Yeah, okay, just, um . . . just be there.  Yeah. Gotta go.  (Sam hangs up his phone and addresses Dean) Hey.  How did you sleep?"
10,17,DEAN,Like a drunk baby.  What do we got?
10,17,SAM,"Uh, nothing."
10,17,DEAN,Really?
10,17,SAM,"Yeah, I mean, uh, no weird deaths, no demon signs.  There's a Kitsune working some truck stops outside of Boise, but Rudy's on it, so . . ."
10,17,DEAN,"All right.  So, uh, snow day.  I say we get drunk and shoot crap."
10,17,SAM,"Yeah, except we do that every day.  Actually, I was thinking about seeing a movie."
10,17,DEAN,"Yeah, that could be cool."
10,17,SAM,It's a French movie.
10,17,DEAN,You mean like nudie French?
10,17,SAM,Even better.  It's about a mime that's secretly a cockroach.
10,17,DEAN,I-I don't get it.
10,17,SAM,"Dude, The New York Times said -"
10,17,DEAN,Who cares?
10,17,SAM,"All right, well . . . It's playing in Wichita, so I might not be back till morning."
10,17,DEAN,"Well, I trust you.  Make good choices."
10,17,SAM,"Right.  You know, I mean . . . I don't have to go alone . . ."
10,17,DEAN,"It's fine.  Besides, I could use a little ""me"" time."
10,17,SAM,All right.  Stay out of my room.
10,17,DEAN,Totally.
10,17,SAM,"Thanks for coming, Cas."
10,17,CASTIEL,Of course.  Where's Dean?
10,17,SAM,This is about Dean.
10,17,CASTIEL,Is he . . . ?
10,17,SAM,"He's getting worse.  Cas, we've gone through every other option possible.  We got to talk about -"
10,17,CASTIEL,Don't say it.
10,17,SAM,"Do you think I want this?  I'm not a fan of it, either.  But if we want to get rid of the Mark . . . I'm just saying Charlie's gone radio silent; everything else we've tried has been a dead end.  So . . ."
10,17,CASTIEL,So I'll drive.
10,17,CROWLEY,Oh. God.
10,17,ROWENA,Please. It's nothing you haven't seen before.
10,17,ROWENA,"Next time, knock."
10,17,CROWLEY,This is my domain.  I don't knock.
10,17,ROWENA,"Did you want something, Fergus?"
10,17,CROWLEY,It's Crow . . . forget it.  What are you doing?
10,17,ROWENA,What do you mean?
10,17,CROWLEY,"I mean you've been nattering constantly at me for weeks, and now you haven't annoyed me for days.  You're up to something."
10,17,ROWENA,"You're right.  I'm seeing someone.  I'm a woman.  I have desires, needs, and Trent is . . ."
10,17,CROWLEY,Trent?  You're dating a . . . Trent?
10,17,ROWENA,"He's an assistant manager at Biggerson's.  He's not the brightest bulb, but he's so . . . firm."
10,17,CROWLEY,Please stop talking.
10,17,ROWENA,You asked.
10,17,CROWLEY,Just put some clothes on.
10,17,DEAN,"Rudy.  Rudy! Hey, look.  I know you can handle it, okay?  I'm just saying that, uh, you know, if you needed a little assist, I could, uh, you know . . . all right.  All right, all right, all right.  Chill out.  Sorry I asked.  All right.  Heh heh heh (chuckling to himself about his pranks on Sam)  Ha.  You know me.  I'm always good.  Hey, I'm fan-damn-tastic."
10,17,GUARD,"That's far enough, Castiel."
10,17,CASTIEL,Excuse me?
10,17,GUARD,I have orders.  You aren't allowed upstairs.
10,17,SAM,Says who?
10,17,GUARD,"Hold, please. (The angel currently in the vessel leaves, while the door opens a crack and another angel comes out and enters the vessel."
10,17,HANNAH,"Hello, Castiel."
10,17,CASTIEL,Hannah.
10,17,HANNAH,"I swore I'd never occupy another vessel, but . . . we need to have this conversation face-to-face."
10,17,CASTIEL,What conversation?
10,17,HANNAH,What do you want in Heaven?
10,17,CASTIEL,Metatron.
10,17,HANNAH,Why?  Is this about your Grace?  Are you fading?
10,17,CASTIEL,I'm fine for now.
10,17,SAM,This is about my brother.
10,17,HANNAH,Because you think Metatron might have information about the Mark of Cain?
10,17,CASTIEL,No. We know he does.
10,17,HANNAH,So he says.  But Metatron lies.
10,17,SAM,"Hannah, we just want to talk with him."
10,17,HANNAH,"No, you want his help.  But we both know the only way Metatron helps you is if he's free.  And I can't let the scribe out of his cell.  Not again.  He's too dangerous."
10,17,CASTIEL,We won't . . .
10,17,HANNAH,"Yes, you will.  Because you're desperate."
10,17,CASTIEL,After all I've done for heaven . . . after all I've done for you.
10,17,HANNAH,I'm sorry.
10,17,CASTIEL,You should be!
10,17,SAM,"Cas, let's go."
10,17,CASTIEL,What? We're leaving?
10,17,SAM,"Yeah, we can't fight off four angels."
10,17,CASTIEL,So . . . so what? You just want to give up on Metatron?
10,17,SAM,"No, we need him.  Time for plan ""B"".  We break him out."
10,17,ROWENA,I'm told you run Hell's switchboard.  Tough job.
10,17,NEBBISHY DEMON,It's not so bad.  I'm just happy to do my part.
10,17,ROWENA,You sure you're a demon?
10,17,NEBBISHY DEMON,Y-you can be damned and a conscientious worker.
10,17,ROWENA,"Oh.  Well, last year, my son . . . Crowley, was taken by the Winchesters.  I need to know where they were holding him, and I'm told he made a call.  I was hoping you could trace it for me."
10,17,NEBBISHY DEMON,O-of course.  Y-you are the queen mother.
10,17,ROWENA,Oh.
10,17,NEBBISHY DEMON,"H-h-he did call, but t-there was some I-interference.  I-I can't get the exact location.  W-would a 10-mile radius work?"
10,17,ROWENA,I'll make do.
10,17,DEAN,"Hey, Donnie."
10,17,DONNIE,"Hey, man."
10,17,DEAN,"I'll do the, uh, HervÈ Villechaize."
10,17,DONNIE,You bet.
10,17,DEAN,Thanks.
10,17,TY,"(one of the boys playing pool, just beat his friend) Boom!  Money. Now. Loser!"
10,17,DEAN,Gracias.
10,17,TY,Give me your cash.  Now. Right now.
10,17,DEAN,What's up with the Abercrombie rejects?
10,17,DONNIE,"College kids ""slumming it."""
10,17,DEAN,"Slumming?  What are you talking about?  This is a nice joint, huh?  You got those custom urinal pucks."
10,17,TY,"Come on, bitches.  Who's next?  20 bucks a game.  20 bucks."
10,17,DEAN,"(Dean scruffs his hair up and walks drunkenly over to the pool table) Yo! Yeah, I'll, uh . . . I'll play."
10,17,TY,"What, seriously?"
10,17,TY’S FRIEND,"Dude, he's blitzed."
10,17,DEAN,"No. No, no, no, no.  I'm . . . I'm . . . I'm fine, man.  I'm good to go.  Hmm?  Good to go."
10,17,TY,He's fine. Grab a stick.
10,17,SAM,"So, back in the '50s, Oliver Pryce was a kid psychic.  He performed everywhere . . . carnivals, Atlantic City . . . you name it.  He was the real deal.  Now, the Men of Letters were teaching him how to control his powers when they got . . . you know."
10,17,CASTIEL,Brutally slaughtered?
10,17,SAM,"The point is, he's one of the good guys.  He might be happy to see us."
10,17,CASTIEL,(upon seeing all of the “no trespassing” signs on the Pryce fence) Or not.
10,17,SAM,(pounds on the door) Mr. Pryce?  Oliver Pryce!
10,17,CASTIEL,I'll break it down.
10,17,SAM,"Dude, dude, dude.  Chill."
10,17,CASTIEL,What?  I'm helping.
10,17,SAM,Just follow my lead.  Mr. Pryce?  This is Sam -
10,17,PRYCE,"Winchester.  You're Sam Winchester, Man of Letters."
10,17,SAM,"Yeah. H-how did you, uh . . ."
10,17,PRYCE,"Mind reader, remember?  And you're . . . What are you?"
10,17,CASTIEL,I'm an Angel.
10,17,PRYCE,"That . . . No, you can't be."
10,17,CASTIEL,Why not?
10,17,PRYCE,Because I'm an atheist.
10,17,SAM,"Not anymore. (Castiel and Sam enter the house, and the party retreats to Pryce’s living room/dining room)"
10,17,CASTIEL,That's you?
10,17,PRYCE,"Was me.  I don't do the psychic stuff no more.  Being around people, it's kind of . . . Hell.  All those brains yapping all the time drives a guy bananas."
10,17,CASTIEL,Because you can hear everyone's thoughts.
10,17,PRYCE,"Well, not yours.  All I'm getting from you is . . . colors.  But the hippie over here?  I'm seeing some creep-ass hobbit-lookin' fella, a prison cell?"
10,17,CASTIEL,That's heaven's jail.
10,17,PRYCE,Heaven's got a freakin' jail?
10,17,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, it does.  And we're looking to break someone out of it."
10,17,PRYCE,Okay.
10,17,CASTIEL,"We have an inside man, but we need your help to talk to him."
10,17,PRYCE,And if I say no?
10,17,SAM,You're the mind reader.
10,17,PRYCE,I'll get my crap.
10,17,DEAN,I'll get it. I'll get it.
10,17,TY,There it is.  Corner pocket.  The king is here.
10,17,DEAN,"Okay, all right. Again?"
10,17,TY,Sure.  Say $100 this time.
10,17,DEAN,Yeah.  Make it $300.
10,17,DEAN,What do you say?
10,17,TY,Uh . . . Give me your cash.
10,17,DEAN,(looking at the money on the table) I think you're a little short there.  Why don't you toss in the watch?  Good to go.
10,17,TY,My dad gave me this watch.
10,17,DEAN,I'm sure it's a very touching story.  Got a little tear in my eye.  Come on.  We gonna play or not?  (Ty takes off his watch and adds it to the pile. Dean sobers instantly) Rack 'em.
10,17,PRYCE,You got anything that belonged to the deceased?
10,17,SAM,Yes. Right here. (He reverently pulls Bobby’s hat out of his bag and places it on the table)
10,17,PRYCE,"Good.  Now shut up and hold hands.  Amate spiritus obscure, Te quaerimus.  Te oramus, nobiscum colloquere, apud nos circita."

10,17,SAM,(coming through the radio) Bobby?
10,17,SONG,“You never count your money”
10,17,SAM,"Bobby, can you hear me?"
10,17,SONG,“when you're sitting at the table”
10,17,SAM,"Bobby, we need your help."
10,17,SONG,“there will be time enough for counting
10,17,BOBBY,Sam?
10,17,SONG,“when the dealing's . . .”
10,17,DEAN,(indicating which pocket the 8-ball will go in) That one.
10,17,TY,You hustled me.
10,17,DEAN,"Well, you're pretty quick for a guy who's all hair gel and body spray. (Dean picks up his coat, the money and Ty’s watch, and heads off to the bathroom)"
10,17,DEAN,"Thanks, fellas."
10,17,TY’S FRIEND,"Forget it, dude.  He's an ass."
10,17,ROWENA,"Hello, boys."
10,17,SAM,"And, uh, that's what's been happening . . . the short version of it, anyway.  You still there, Bobby?"
10,17,BOBBY,"Yeah, Sam.  It's just . . . Real good to hear your voice."
10,17,SAM,"Yeah, you, too."
10,17,BOBBY,"Okay.  If, uh, I'm understanding right, you got to figure a way to get the Mark of Cain off Dean before it turns him back into a demon?"
10,17,SAM,"Pretty much, yeah."
10,17,BOBBY,"So, just another day at the office for you boys, huh?  Put Dean on the line."
10,17,SAM,Dean's not here.
10,17,BOBBY,Why not?
10,17,SAM,"We . . . Dean's, um . . . He's not in a good place right now, Bobby."
10,17,BOBBY,So what's the play?
10,17,CASTIEL,"Each soul in heaven is locked in its own private paradise.  That's where you are now. You need to escape.  You need to find the gate to earth and open it.  Then you and I will find Metatron, the Scribe of God."
10,17,BOBBY,"Hey, Sam, you remember when this job was just chopping up some fang and tossing back a cold one?"
10,17,SAM,I miss that.
10,17,BOBBY,"Ditto.  So, while I'm playing Steve McQueen, anyone gonna be looking for me?"
10,17,CASTIEL,Everyone.  The Angels will not like a soul wandering free.
10,17,BOBBY,We got a way to slow them down?
10,17,SAM,"Not exactly.  But, um, you'll . . . you'll figure something out, Bobby. You always do."
10,17,BOBBY,"Listen, I appreciate the warm fuzzy, but I ain't exactly playing on the big leagues these days.  I'm mostly drinking and reading the classics.  Truth is, I'm rusty.  And maybe there's somebody better out there."
10,17,SAM,"There isn't, Bobby.  And w-with Dean the way he is . . . This is all we got."
10,17,BOBBY,"Hell, I'm already dead.  What's the worst that could happen?"
10,17,ROWENA,Dean.
10,17,DEAN,"Rowena?  What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?  I'm sorry. Did I say ""nice girl""?  I meant ""evil skank"""""
10,17,ROWENA,"You say that like it's an insult.  But nice girls, they're pathetic.  Here's to evil skanks."
10,17,DEAN,"Whoa, fellas. What did she do to you?"
10,17,ROWENA,Someone's tougher than he looks.
10,17,DEAN,You have no idea.
10,17,ROWENA,"A spioradÌ an tsaoil, ÈistigÌ liom!  DÛighigÌ an fear seo!  DÛighigÌ go luaithreach È!"
10,17,DEAN,"(grabs Rowena, and knife to neck, pushes her down on the bar) What the hell are you doing here?"
10,17,ROWENA,Saving my son.
10,17,DEAN,Your son?
10,17,ROWENA,"My son is a king, a god . . . or he would be if you didn't . . . you snap your fingers, and he comes running like a wee lapdog."
10,17,DEAN,"Lady, I don't know what you're talking about."
10,17,ROWENA,You're a good influence on him.  That's why you need to die.
10,17,DEAN,"Well, sorry your little light show didn't work."
10,17,ROWENA,"Oh, I'll try again."
10,17,DEAN,"What, you think I'm just gonna let you walk out of here?"
10,17,DEAN,"I think you're a hero.  You could have killed those men, but you didn't because they're innocent.  'Cause you're the good guy, and you want them to live.  But the spell I cast will devour them from the inside out like it did that girl."
10,17,ROWENA,Impetus bestiarum.
10,17,DEAN,What did you do to her?
10,17,ROWENA,I'm the only one that can save them.  What's it going to be . . . Hero?
10,17,BOBBY,"So, where do we start?"
10,17,CASTIEL,"You need to find your heaven's escape hatch.  Look for something that shouldn't be there, and that's your way out."
10,17,BOBBY,"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. (Bobby walks out into the hallways of Heaven; the Axis Mundi. An alarm starts sounding) Balls!"
10,17,CROWLEY,"Rough date, mother?"
10,17,ROWENA,Dean Winchester did this to me.
10,17,CROWLEY,(to his minions) Get out.
10,17,MINION,"Yes, sir."
10,17,CROWLEY,(turning back to Rowena) Why were you anywhere near Dean Winchester?
10,17,ROWENA,I was trying to kill him.
10,17,CROWLEY,Been there.  Never seems to work out quite the way you want.
10,17,ROWENA,"The spell I cast should have ripped him apart, but . . ."
10,17,CROWLEY,It was like Dean was protected from on high.  It's the Mark of Cain.  It never lets its host die easy.
10,17,ROWENA,"The Mark?  It's just a curse.  T-The First Curse.  But still, it can be removed."
10,17,CROWLEY,How?
10,17,ROWENA,I'll find a way.
10,17,CROWLEY,You do that.  I assume you had a reason for this little suicide run of yours.
10,17,ROWENA,"The best reason . . . you.  Those tumshies have you on a leash.  I thought I-if they were gone, you . . ."
10,17,CROWLEY,"I know what you thought.  And I know that you were wrong.  I have Sam and Dean exactly where I want them.  What do they say?  Friends close, enemies closer."
10,17,ROWENA,Maybe they were your enemies once.  But now? Please.  Do you even care that Dean Winchester mutilated your mother?!
10,17,CROWLEY,Because you were stupid.
10,17,ROWENA,"Because I love you.  Well, if my suffering's not enough, you know how much demons gossip.  Right now, word's already spreading about all this.  If you do nothing, you'll look weak.  Your subjects will start to doubt you, mock you.  Then it's just a matter of time before you have a revolt on your hands, before you lose your throne."
10,17,CROWLEY,You're playing a dangerous game.
10,17,ROWENA,"And it's your move.  So you can't kill Dean. Fine.  Take him, throw him in some dank cell, let him rot.  But do something!  No more stalling.  No more excuses.  Show them how strong you really are.  Be a bloody king!"
10,17,CASTIEL,You sure he can handle this?
10,17,SAM,He's Bobby.  He can handle anything.
10,17,HANNAH,"What?  Find out how this happened.  Excuse me, gentlemen.  Gentlemen...and lady, I need you to return to your heavens in a calm, orderly manner."
10,17,BOBBY,"Oh, yeah? Well, who made you boss?"
10,17,OTHER SOUL,Right?
10,17,OTHER SOUL,Who the hell you think do you are?
10,17,HANNAH,"Let's go.  Hold off, gentlemen and lady.  (The souls all start pushing and shoving to try and get past HANNAH and the angels) Gentlemen, easy.  Please!  (Bobby slips past and goes down another hallway.)"
10,17,DEAN,Been waiting on you.
10,17,CROWLEY,Squirrel.
10,17,DEAN,Borris.  Where's Natasha?
10,17,CROWLEY,Would it make a difference?
10,17,DEAN,"Not really.  So, we gonna do this?"
10,17,ANGEL RADIO,"The Bobbys are fighting back.  All hands.  We need all hands.  They're surly.  I repeat, the Bobbys are surly."
10,17,BOBBY,"(Remembering his conversation with Castiel during the seance) If I find a way out, then what?"
10,17,CASTIEL,The gate is behind door number . . .
10,17,BOBBY,42. (He finds the door marked “42” and opens it.)
10,17,SAM,Go.  Go! (shouting to Cas as they get out of the car)
10,17,BOBBY,Welcome to the party.
10,17,CASTIEL,"The prison, it's, uh . . . it's close."
10,17,BOBBY,"Uh-huh.  Cas, where's Dean?"
10,17,CASTIEL,What?
10,17,BOBBY,You heard me.
10,17,CASTIEL,"Dean's, uh . . . he's resting.  He's . . . sick, and . . ."
10,17,BOBBY,Try again.
10,17,CASTIEL,Dean doesn't know we're doing this.
10,17,BOBBY,"Well, that's a page right out of the Winchester playbook, ain't it?"
10,17,CASTIEL,Dean has given up.
10,17,BOBBY,And you idjits haven't.
10,17,CASTIEL,Would you?
10,17,BOBBY,"Hell, no."
10,17,DEAN,"Look, I'm not saying that I didn't want to slice and dice the witch.  I'm just saying that that's not how it went down."
10,17,CROWLEY,So she's a liar.
10,17,DEAN,Must run in the family.
10,17,CROWLEY,"Mother says that Mark is just a curse, can be removed.  Of course, she doesn't know how."
10,17,DEAN,"Figures.  But I'm good, thanks."
10,17,CROWLEY,Who's the liar now? (They both take a sip from their drinks.) She says I've gone soft.
10,17,DEAN,"You have.  What?  Yeah, maybe it's all the human blood that Sammy pumped into you, you know? Maybe it's, uh . . . I don't know.  I don't know.  But the old Crowley, he would have come in here with hellhounds and demons, and he would have blown the roof off the joint.  Now?  You didn't want to fight.  You wanted to talk.  And maybe I've changed, too.  Here I am playing Dr. Phil to the King of Hell.  Never saw that coming."
10,17,CROWLEY,Maybe we're getting old.
10,17,DEAN,"Never saw that coming, either.  What is it, huh?  Why you letting mommy dearest tie you into knots?"
10,17,CROWLEY,Because . . . We're family.  Blood.
10,17,DEAN,"That's not the same thing.  A wise man once told me, ""family don't end in blood,"" but it doesn't start there, either.  Family cares about you, not what you can do for them.  Family's there through the good, bad . . . all of it.  They got your back . . . even when it hurts.  That's family.  That sound like your mother?"
10,17,METATRON,"Well, howdy, fellas."
10,17,BOBBY,This is the Scribe of God?  He looks like a Fraggle.
10,17,METATRON,I'm gonna take that as a compliment.  That was an excellent program.
10,17,CASTIEL,"Metatron, we are here -"
10,17,METATRON,"I know why you're here, ""Asstiel,"" and I'm not interested.  I told you I would rather die than let Dean Winchester use me as his personal punching bag again."
10,17,METATRON,"Ah.  The ""B"" team, huh?"
10,17,BOBBY,Heh.
10,17,METATRON,Interesting.  Keys are over there.  Chop chop!
10,17,BOBBY,Are you sure this is the only way?
10,17,CASTIEL,Unfortunately.
10,17,METATRON,"Sam-tastic!  Miss me?  Oh, smell that?  That smells like freedom.  Well, let's go.  I call shotgun!"
10,17,CASTIEL,"You don't get to make demands, Metatron.  You're not in charge here."
10,17,METATRON,"Oh, I'm afraid I am.  I know about the Mark.  I have your Grace.  I make the rules.  It's called leverage, boys.  Learn it, live it, love it."
10,17,METATRON,Ow! Ow!
10,17,CASTIEL,"We have your Grace, Metatron.  You're mortal now.  So you will answer our questions, or Sam will, um . . . What's the phrase?  Blow your fricking brains out.  It's called leverage, Metatron."
10,17,SAM,"""Learn it, live it, love it.""  How do we get rid of the Mark?"
10,17,METATRON,"I-I don't know. (SAM aims the gun at METATRON's head.) I don't know!  No, I-it's old magic . . . God-level magic!  Or Lucifer level, but you can't ask him, exactly, can you?"
10,17,CASTIEL,What about the tablets?
10,17,METATRON,"No, Th-there's . . . there's nothing in them about the Mark."
10,17,SAM,"So when you said ""The river ends at the source,"" that was-"
10,17,METATRON,"I was just making up crap, trying to buy time till I could screw you over."
10,17,SAM,No.
10,17,METATRON,What?!  It worked before.
10,17,CASTIEL,He's telling the truth.
10,17,SAM,What?
10,17,CASTIEL,Shoot him.
10,17,METATRON,"No, no! No! Your Grace!  I wasn't lying about that.  There's still some left.  I'll take you to it."
10,17,SAM,"It's your call, Cas."
10,17,ROWENA,Is it done?
10,17,CROWLEY,We're done.  Get your things and get out.
10,17,ROWENA,You aren't serious.
10,17,CROWLEY,Deadly.
10,17,ROWENA,But I'm your mother.
10,17,CROWLEY,"You may have brought me into this world, but you were never my mother."
10,17,ROWENA,So you're choosing the Winchesters.
10,17,CROWLEY,"I'm choosing me.  I put up with your lies, your sad little schemes because . . . no.  Because maybe you were right.  Maybe I did lose my edge.  But that ends now.  Tell me, Rowena, if I were not the King of Hell, would you have ever bothered to pretend to care about me?"
10,17,ROWENA,You . . . you can't.
10,17,CROWLEY,"I can.  I'm bloody Crowley!  I'm the King of Hell.  I do what I want, when I want.  And I don't take orders from you."
10,17,ROWENA,"Everything you have, I will watch it burn!"
10,17,CROWLEY,"I'll give you five minutes.  After that, pray I don't see you again."
10,17,SAM,Hey.
10,17,SAM,French.  What about you?  What did you do last night?
10,17,DEAN,Played some pool.  It was kind of boring.
10,17,SAM,All right. I'm gonna clean up.
10,17,DEAN,Yeah.
10,17,CASTIEL,Sam.  Bobby asked me to give you this.
10,17,BOBBY’S VOICE,"“Sam . . . So . . . this is weird, huh?  Look, I just wanted to say that Cas told me what you're doing for Dean.  And I'm not asking you to stop, but maybe going behind his back ain't the best idea.  Your brother, he can be stubborn.  But I think he'd understand.  And I know it's the life . . . doing a little bad so you can do a lot of good.  But sometimes the bad's real bad and the good . . . it can come at one hell of a price.  I ain't there on the ground, and whatever you do, I know you'll make the right choice.  You're a good man, Sam Winchester . . . one of the best.  And I'm damn proud of you, son.  I was content up here.  But getting the call from you, it's the happiest I've been in forever, no matter what it costs. (Int. scene in Bobby’s heaven, where he’s looking at a picture of him and Sam and Dean, when the door opens and a troop of angels come in and stand behind him.) So stay safe, keep fighting, and kick it in the ass.  Bobby."
10,21,Ext. Scene,the camera pans up an old building for lease.  The scene changes to a young woman walking down a hallway past a janitor mopping the floor.  She enters a room to find a young man in a lab coat sitting at a computer.  She approaches and hands him her file.  (The audience finds out later in the episode that the young man is Eldon Styne.)
10,21,ELDON,Ah.  You must be Eileen.
10,21,EILEEN,"Yes. I'm here for the interview.  Thank you so much for fitting me in after hours.  As, um, as you can see, I'm in good health and my eyesight is 20/20, which is important, yes?  Because this is a research study on eyesight?"
10,21,ELDON,Mm-hmm.
10,21,EILEEN,"M-my friends and I do as many of these clinical studies as we can 'cause we're all on budgets, and the money from these things really helps with college."
10,21,ELDON,Okay.  Everything seems to be in order.
10,21,EILEEN,Okay.
10,21,ELDON,Let's take a peek at these eyes.
10,21,EILEEN,Yes.
10,21,ELDON,(holding her face and looking into her eyes) Okay.  Mm-hmm. (He leans in to try and kiss her)
10,21,EILEEN,"(trying to push him away) N-no! No!  (the scene flashes to the hallway, where the janitor hears Eileen’s scream) No!  No!"
10,21,JANITOR,"Everything okay in there?  What's going on?!  Everything okay?  (the janitor opens the door with his keys, and walks in just in time to see Eldon jump from the window.) Hey!"
10,21,Int. Scene,Sam is down in the basement where he has stashed Rowena.
10,21,SAM,"Nothing?  You've got nothing?!  Rowena, it's been days!  You said the codex would crack the code."
10,21,ROWENA,"I am an artist, Samuel.  These things cannot be rushed.  Perhaps if I weren't chained up . . . I'm really not at full strength."
10,21,SAM,"Yeah, and you won’t be at full strength.  No witchcraft.  Look, I need the cure for my brother from the book, and if you're stalling . . ."
10,21,ROWENA,"Why on earth would I stall?!  I want the Mark off your brother for my own protection!  I want out of these chains and out of this pit, and I want you to hold up your end of the deal and kill Crowley.  You do remember the deal, do you not, Samuel?"
10,21,SAM,"Believe me, I have no issue killing Crowley!"
10,21,ROWENA,"The problem is, the language Nadya used in the codex is damn near indecipherable.  She was a gifted witch but a selfish pig.  Once she cracked a code, she then coded its secrets for herself."
10,21,SAM,So . . . Now we need to break a code to . . . break a code?
10,21,ROWENA,"Quick, aren't you?"
10,21,SAM,"Listen, Dean gets worse every day.  Get this done."
10,21,ROWENA,"You won't forget the grocery shopping, will you?"
10,21,SAM,No.
10,21,Int. Scene,"The camera shows a large estate that resembles a plantation house, but the scene quickly moves into what looks to be a study.  The Stynes are having a family meeting."
10,21,MONROE,"Astounding.  Astounding and disappointing.  There was a time, Eldon, when I would call you our most promising.  You ask your brothers and your cousins.  But clearly, you have been spoiled and overindulged, and the result is arrogance.  The utter lack of judgment.  You thought you'd take time for a little quickie with that girl before you harvested her."
10,21,ELDON,Sir . . .
10,21,MONROE,And you were discovered by a witness.  We don't have witnesses!
10,21,ELI,And left a body behind.
10,21,MONROE,And we certainly don't leave behind bodies when we harvest.  The whole key to our success all these centuries is secrecy.
10,21,ELDON,Daddy . . . I've never done anything like this before.  I haven't been myself . . . ever since Jacob died.
10,21,MONROE,"Oh, no.  No, no, no.  Don't you dare cheapen the memory of your brother by using him as an excuse for your foolishness."
10,21,ELDON,"I'm filled with regret, sir."
10,21,MONROE,"I doubt that.  But you will be if you are cast down to the lower echelons of this family, where you will exchange your title of son and heir for lab rat."
10,21,ELDON,I made this single mistake.
10,21,MONROE,"Discipline.  It is all that holds our life together.  If it unravels, we are done.  Here's how you'll redeem yourself.  First, clean up your mess in Omaha.  Next, you will track down these Winchesters who murdered your brother Jacob, and who may now have in their possession
The Book of the Damned."
10,21,ELDON,It will be done. (exit Eldon)
10,21,ELI,Sir?  Uncle Monroe?
10,21,MONROE,"Yes, Eli?"
10,21,ELI,I was wondering if it was best to put such an important assignment in Eldon's hands since his . . . judgment is so questionable.
10,21,MONROE,"That's very bold of you, Eli, considering your own issues."
10,21,ELI,"My issues, sir?"
10,21,MONROE,The mysterious redheaded girl that your cousin Jacob was tracking when he died . . . the one that stole the book . . . was that task not passed on to you?  Have you located her?
10,21,ELI,"I'm trying, sir.  There's still no trace of her."
10,21,MONROE,"Well, if the Winchesters don't have the book, she's got it.  So if you're so worried that your cousin will fail, report in with Eldon and back his effort.  Now get out."
10,21,Int. Scene,Sam comes descends the steps into the bunker.  Dean’s sitting at a table in the library looking up the Styne family on the computer.
10,21,DEAN,Wow.
10,21,SAM,Hey.
10,21,DEAN,"Well, you look like crap on toast."
10,21,SAM,I just haven't . . . really been sleeping well.
10,21,DEAN,There's a woman you haven't mentioned?
10,21,SAM,A woman?
10,21,DEAN,"Well, I'm just saying.  You weren't here when I went to bed last night.  You've been running off on your own a lot these past couple weeks."
10,21,SAM,I do that.
10,21,DEAN,You actually don’t.
10,21,SAM,"Dean, we don't always do the exact same thing at the exact same time.  Remember when you went off and snuffed that vampire nest by yourself?"
10,21,DEAN,Have you been snuffing vamps' nests?
10,21,SAM,"No, I-I . . . What is that?  What are you doing?"
10,21,DEAN,"So, those goons that were after the book, the, uh, the Stynes, well, the one that we killed said that he had a big family.  So if there's more out there, I figure we should probably get to know as much as we can about them."
10,21,SAM,And?
10,21,DEAN,"Well, that’s pretty much what we do know, that they screwed with financial markets, they helped Hitler get started, along with god knows what else . . . probably disco.  But you go back to the 1800s, and the trail goes dead.  There's nothing in the research, there's nothing online.  It's like the family just popped up one day."
10,21,SAM,Families don't usually do that.
10,21,DEAN,"No, they do not.  Hasn't been a total waste of time, though.  I think I caught us a case.  There's a mention online of a murder in Omaha.  Victim's eyes were cut out.  Janitor runs in just as the killer jumps out the window."
10,21,SAM,That's it?
10,21,DEAN,"Well, the window was on the third story.  Look, man, I'm just trying to stay busy here, okay?  Unless you have bigger fish to fry."
10,21,SAM,"No, I-I'm sold.  I'm in."
10,21,DEAN,"All right, well, I'm gonna hit it.  You probably should, too.  We'll leave first thing in the a.m."
10,21,Ext. scene,A car pulls up to a rest stop in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere.  Charlie sits at a picnic table.
10,21,SAM,"Hey, Charlie."
10,21,CHARLIE,"Hey. It is you.  Uh, in a . . . beat-up, prehistoric subcompact.  But why are we meeting here?  I could've come to the Death Star."
10,21,SAM,"No, no, this is, uh . . . this is better, actually.  We're not gonna be working in the bunker, so . . ."
10,21,CHARLIE,"Uh-huh.  What is this about, again?  You were kind of . . . vague."
10,21,SAM,"Okay, so, here's the thing . . . Dean is not getting any better.  I feel like if we don't get the Mark off his arm, it's gonna eat him up."
10,21,CHARLIE,"I get it, but what are we gonna do about it?"
10,21,SAM,"I got ahold of a codex which is sort of a-a collection of supernatural code-breaking tools, and it should help crack The Book of the Damned."
10,21,CHARLIE,"That would be awesome if the book, you know, actually existed."
10,21,SAM,"It does. Uh, I, um . . . I swapped it out right before it looked like I burned it."
10,21,CHARLIE,"Okay.  Well, Dean wanted it burned, so is he pissed?  Of course.  He doesn't know.  Geez! The two of you."
10,21,SAM,"Charlie, he's not himself.  He's not.  He would try and stop me.  He's given up.  Look, I called in an expert to . . . to use the codex, but it turns out it's sort of . . . encoded also, so I thought you might help . . . move things along faster."
10,21,CHARLIE,Behind Dean's back.  After Dean told us the stupid book would kick our asses if we mess with it.  I . . . is there any part of this that doesn't reek?  Did I mention you'll be working with one of the most dangerous witches in the world?
10,21,CHARLIE,"I don't know, Sam."
10,21,SAM,"As far as I can tell, this is . . . Our only shot at saving him.  If we don't take it . . . He's gone."
10,21,ROWENA,"I thought I was clear, Samuel.  I requested more time, not an assistant."
10,21,SAM,"And I thought I was clear, Rowena.  Charlie is not your assistant.  You're hers."
10,21,ROWENA,And you studied your craft where?
10,21,CHARLIE,Mostly a joint called Mas Java.  It has excellent Wi-Fi.
10,21,ROWENA,"I have not heard of this institution, and I know all the great global centers of witchcraft."
10,21,CHARLIE,"Makes sense, 'cause I'm not a witch.  I'm a nerd.  And I know all the great centers of nerddom."
10,21,SAM,"Rowena, are you done marking your turf?  Listen, Charlie has tech chops that'll speed up cracking Nadya's codex.  You will spot the ancient curses and spells, and that'll put this whole mess in context."
10,21,CHARLIE,"Cas.  Are you in on this, too?"
10,21,ROWENA,Hell's bells.  More distractions?  What are you?  Witch or nerd?
10,21,CASTIEL,Angel.
10,21,ROWENA,Beg pardon?
10,21,SAM,"Castiel has, uh, powers . . . spiritual muscle that'll help safeguard the work."
10,21,ROWENA,Safeguard it from what?
10,21,SAM,You.  I can't be here full time to referee.
10,21,CASTIEL,"Whoa, whoa.  And I can?"
10,21,SAM,Yes. Please.  Please do this for me.
10,21,CASTIEL,"Well, what are the rules?  If I'm gonna referee,  I should at least know them."
10,21,ROWENA,"Quite literal, aren't you?  Does he know that the first rule is don't tell your brother what we're doing?"
10,21,CASTIEL,"Wait . . . Dean doesn't know?  Sam, this never ends well."
10,21,CHARLIE,That's exactly what I said.
10,21,SAM,"Okay, everyone take a breath.  Look, we're up against it, okay?  And we've all been up against it before, and we know there are times when every choice sucks.  Now, us . . . lying to Dean . . . is the choice that sucks the least.  We have to make this work.  Please."
10,21,CHARLIE,"Okay, yeah.  For Dean."
10,21,SAM,Cas?
10,21,CASTIEL,Okay.  For Dean.
10,21,SAM,For Dean.
10,21,ROWENA,I barely know the man.
10,21,Int. Scene,Crowley's Throne Room.  Crowley is throwing darts at a man’s chest when two of his minions appear.
10,21,CROWLEY,I hope this is important.  I have a perfect game going.
10,21,MINION 1,"T-t-there's a problem, majesty."
10,21,CROWLEY,"Just for once, I wish you trolls would bring me some good news.  ""Sire, Missouri has boils.""  Something cheerful."
10,21,MINION 2,It's your majesty's mother.
10,21,CROWLEY,What about my mother?
10,21,MINION 1,"Wh . . . uh, s-she's missing."
10,21,CROWLEY,What? (picks up an angel blade and kills minion 1) You've heard of killing the messenger?  Don't come back without news of my mother.  (To the man he's throwing darts at) Shut up.
10,21,PRISONER,(examines the darts in his chest) Nice grouping.
10,21,Int. Scene,Sam and Dean walk down the hallway of the building where Eldon killed the college student.  They enter the room with the office manager.
10,21,OFFICE MANAGER,"Police told me no one was allowed in.  That didn't mean the FBI, right?"
10,21,DEAN,And the janitor came in right after the killing?
10,21,OFFICE MANAGER,"Yeah, he heard screaming . . . maybe when her eyeballs were scooped out?  Janitor saw a man jump out the window, run down the alley."
10,21,SAM,"Running?  After, uh . . . falling three stories?"
10,21,OFFICE MANAGER,That's what it looked like.
10,21,DEAN,Security footage?
10,21,OFFICE MANAGER,"Yeah, sure.  Uh, but just one of them caught any action.  Out in the alley.  That's the guy who rented the office."
10,21,DEAN,That's pretty slick for a three-story drop.
10,21,SAM,"Wait a second.  Can you, uh, play it again?  Yeah.  Keep going.  Okay, freeze there.  Zoom in. (makes the zoom in motion with his hand even though he's not holding the iPad. Twice.)"
10,21,DEAN,Same ink as the Stynes.
10,21,SAM,How long was he renting here?
10,21,OFFICE MANAGER,"Uh, just a month.  But I only saw him a day or so.  Some sort of clinical trial using student volunteers.  He didn't mention eyeballs."
10,21,DEAN,"Hm. Well, I guess you're gonna ask about that from now on, huh?"
10,21,SAM,Excuse me.
10,21,DEAN,"Listen, you, uh, remember anything else,  give us a call."
10,21,SAM,(waggling his phone at Dean after silencing it) Telemarketer.
10,21,ELDON,You're quite the chatty Patty.  What'd you tell those two?
10,21,OFFICE MANAGER,Hardly anything.  Nothing.  I-I've got nothing to say.
10,21,ELDON,I believe you.
10,21,CHARLIE,Damn it.
10,21,ROWENA,"That miraculous machine of yours hasn't solved everything by now?  (fake cough) Overrated, I'd say."
10,21,CHARLIE,I'm using the computer to find some pattern in the book's coding or any synchronicity with the symbols in Nadya's codex.
10,21,ROWENA,Oh.  I'm more old-school.  I read the signs nature shows me . . . the forces that ruled before there was man.
10,21,CHARLIE,Wow. Why didn't I think of that?
10,21,CASTIEL,"Okay, it sounds like blood sugar is dipping in here.  I got snacks.  When I was human, I grew very fond of these pork rinds."
10,21,CHARLIE,What do you know about the chick who wrote The Book of the Damned?
10,21,ROWENA,Agnes was a hermit nun . . . And as mad as a hatter.  Made it her business to undo curses.
10,21,CASTIEL,Like the one that caused the Mark of Cain.
10,21,ROWENA,"As in any struggle between good and evil, balance is required.  To cure one curse,  Agnes had to know how to inflict another.  They live side-by-side in the magic world.  One cannot be without the other."
10,21,CHARLIE,"Sure, sure. Like, uh, a binary system.  So, I got to think like a hermit nun."
10,21,ROWENA,Did I mention they burned her alive?
10,21,CHARLIE,"""They""?"
10,21,ROWENA,A cornucopia of curses and satanic visions did not go unnoticed by the church hierarchy.  These men would not abide a rogue nun.
10,21,CHARLIE,Poor Agnes.  Ahead of her time.
10,21,ROWENA,Much like you and I.
10,21,CASTIEL,Well . . .
10,21,CHARLIE,I actually don't . . . see our similarities all that much.
10,21,ROWENA,Because you're young and good and I'm ancient and evil?  Is that it?
10,21,CHARLIE,Wha . . . ?
10,21,ROWENA,"Let me tell you about you . . . a difficult and lonely childhood.  Tragedy, absent parents.  Always outside the mainstream.  Sexually progressive.  Living in your own head for solace and direction."
10,21,CHARLIE,"Yeah, but still, we are pretty different."
10,21,ROWENA,I read you the minute I saw you.  And I'm sure you're learning that the line between good and evil is quite flexible.  But we part company when it comes to blind devotion.  Case in point . . . the Winchesters.  You've made them the family you don't have.  Foolish.
10,21,CHARLIE,Sam and Dean are like my brothers.  I love them.
10,21,ROWENA,"I know.  And that steadfast loyalty will be your undoing, my girl."
10,21,SAM,"So, why would the Stynes be actually up to the eyeballs in murder?  What's the connection?"
10,21,DEAN,"Well, when you take a few Stynes down, more pop up.  I mean, how many are there?  All I can say is, I'm glad we burned that damn book.  At least they can't get their mitts on that."
10,21,SAM,"Yeah.  Uh, what about you? How you doing?"
10,21,DEAN,"Oh, you mean the thing?"
10,21,SAM,Yeah.
10,21,DEAN,"Yeah.  You know, some dark thoughts, creepy visions, violent urges.  Same old same old.  I'm happy I got a murder to focus on, though."
10,21,Int. Bunker,"Dean wanders into the library where Sam's phone is vibrating.  Dean answers when he sees that it’s Castiel calling.  This scene flips back and forth between Dean and Cas while they’re on the phone, and ends with Sam and Dean talking about dinner."
10,21,DEAN,Cas?
10,21,CASTIEL,Sam.
10,21,DEAN,"No, it's Dean.  What's up?"
10,21,CASTIEL,"Nothing.  I'm just, uh . . . Just staying in touch.  Like I do."
10,21,DEAN,Something on your mind?
10,21,CAS,No.  This call is pointless.  My ride's here. (Cas hangs up on Dean.)
10,21,SAM,Hey.
10,21,DEAN,Hey.
10,21,SAM,"The fridge is picked clean.  Your turn to fly.  I buy.  (indicating the phone) That's, uh, that's mine, right?"
10,21,DEAN,"Hey, uh, you talk to . . .  talk to Cas recently?"
10,21,SAM,"No. Um, not for a while.  Why?"
10,21,DEAN,I was just wondering what he's up to.  He's got to be up to something right?
10,21,SAM,Yeah.  Angel stuff or . . . I don't know.
10,21,DEAN,Yeah.
10,21,SAM,"All right, I vote for pizza."
10,21,MINION 2,"We are scouring the planet, sire, a-around the clock.  We will not rest until your mother is found."
10,21,CROWLEY,I should say you aren't.  And I have another mission for you.
10,21,MINION 2,"Yes, sir. (he hands the minion the note he just wrote)"
10,21,CROWLEY,Locate this person . . . immediately.  I don't care what it takes.  Fail on pain of infinite pain.
10,21,MINION 2,"On it, your majesty."
10,21,CROWLEY,You're still here.  (exit Minion 2) Surrounded by mediocrity.  It's a wonder I stay so buoyant.
10,21,DEAN,"All right, hold it right there.  Hey. Hold it.  I said, ""hold it."""
10,21,CHARLIE,"I am doing my best, but with her criticizing, breathing down my neck, trying to sign me up for team witch . . . oh, oh, and moaning how the one good year for music was 1723 . . . I . . .  I am going crazy.  I know. No, I mean, she is evil."
10,21,CASTIEL,"She is a wicked witch, so by definition . . ."
10,21,CHARLIE,"No, no, no, I mean something bad is gonna happen here.  Castiel, man, just spring me for two hours, one hour . . . anyplace quiet.  Dean is my buddy, and I cannot screw this up, but . . . but my mind is . . . is . . . it's a wad of gummy worms.  Please."
10,21,DEAN,"Here's how this works.  You're strong.  I'll give you that.  But you can bleed and hurt just like the next guy, so I'm gonna ask questions, you're gonna give answers, or it's gonna get crazy real quick."
10,21,ELDON,"Well, I hope you got some time.  I'm not the usual breed of cat."
10,21,DEAN,Neither are we.  Did you kill that girl in Omaha?
10,21,ELDON,"Yeah.  (noticing the Mark of Cain on Dean’s arm) So, it's true.  You have the Mark of Cain.  My sympathies.  That’s why you wanted the book . . . to remove it."
10,21,SAM,"We wanted the book because that's where your power comes from.  See, our family business is putting guys like you out of business."
10,21,ELDON,"Oh.  It's impressive.  Let me tell you about my family business.  You're in way over your heads.  The family is vast . . . spread over the world.  And that power that you mentioned doesn't come from the book.  It comes from intelligence and will.  The book facilitates.  Stock market dive, recession, 9/11 . . . any of them ring a bell?  Arab spring.  Didn't even break a sweat."
10,21,SAM,Okay.  Why?
10,21,ELDON,"Well, you got to be in it to win it, boys.  You see, chaos breeds fear.  Fear breeds panic, and panic breeds desperation, and there's always profit to be made from desperation.  You make a big enough mess, has to get cleaned up.  And we've been in the fix-it business for 1,000 years, and business has never been better.  (Sam’s phone starts vibrating.  Cas is calling)  Now, for the last 80 years, we haven't had the book.  With the book, we're unstoppable."
10,21,SAM,"Cas, what's going on?  Make it quick."
10,21,DEAN,The girl you killed . . . why take her eyes?
10,21,ELDON,That whole situation . . . unfortunate.  We normally never leave a body when we harvest.
10,21,DEAN,When you what?
10,21,ELDON,"It's a family specialty . . . bioengineering.  Surgical enhancement.  And I'm not talking about nose jobs.  See?  (He pulls up his shirt to reveal a large surgical scar running down his chest.) Two hearts in here.  Bunch of extra muscle, especially in the legs.  Every man in the family's had a little something.  Pretty much what you'd expect, though, given the family tree."
10,21,DEAN,The Stynes?
10,21,ELDON,The real family tree.  The name was altered out of necessity.  You have chanced upon a lineage with a long and proud tradition . . . And some unwanted notoriety.  One of Europe's oldest families.  The house of . . . Frankenstein.
10,21,CHARLIE,Let me focus.
10,21,ROWENA,The greatest witches of history have sought my counseling.  Yet you spurn me when I offer myself as collaborator!
10,21,CHARLIE,"Oh, my God! This is . . ."
10,21,CAS,I don't think I'm making myself clear.  I've got a . . . I've got a situation here.
10,21,SAM,"There's no way Charlie can go off by herself.  Cas, there are dangerous people looking for her."
10,21,CASTIEL,Fine. I'll go with her.
10,21,SAM,"No, you . . . You can't leave Rowena alone, either."
10,21,CASTIEL,Nothing is getting done.
10,21,SAM,"Then separate them, Cas. Just do the best you can."
10,21,DEAN,Frankensteins aren't real.  They're made up.
10,21,ELDON,"Yeah, of course.  And we never had a family acquaintance named Mary Shelley who spent a few nights in castle Frankenstein and stumbled upon our secrets, and forced us to change our name and go underground."
10,21,DEAN,"So, why didn't Shelley go public?"
10,21,ELDON,She wrote a book.  Doesn't get more public than that.
10,21,DEAN,Mm.
10,21,ELDON,"But no one believed it to be true, just like no one's gonna believe you."
10,21,DEAN,"Well, as long as my brother and me believe, that's enough."
10,21,ELDON,"Yeah, well . . . as mighty as I'm sure your little family is, mine is a juggernaut.  We're not ordinary men.  We're Spartans."
10,21,DEAN,But you aren't immortal.
10,21,ELDON,"What we are is expendable.  I go down, there's an army of replacements behind me."
10,21,DEAN,"And where does this army call home, hm?  Who's big daddy Frankenstein?"
10,21,ELDON,Were you here when I mentioned that we're underground?  There are secrets.
10,21,DEAN,"Well, I'm swell at uncovering secrets."
10,21,ELDON,"You give me the book, and it's conceivable that we could have a conversation."
10,21,DEAN,The book?
10,21,ELDON,Mm.
10,21,DEAN,"Dude, we don't have the book.  The book was burned."
10,21,ELDON,The book is protected by a spell.  It's eternal.  It cannot be destroyed.
10,21,SAM,"Look, Cas,  I got to get back.  Handle this.  I'll be there as soon as I can. (Sam hangs up the phone)"
10,21,DEAN,What are you doing?
10,21,SAM,Uh . . . Something came up.
10,21,DEAN,What?
10,21,SAM,"It's handled.  Uh, what's going on in there? Get any more out of him?"
10,21,DEAN,"Yeah, an earful . . . truly.  Let me ask you something."
10,21,DEAN,"Oh, my God.  He ripped it off."
10,21,ROWENA,"Alone time?  Why does she need alone time?  Bit of a prima Donna, if you ask me.  The girl is simply out of her league.  Without me, the work grinds to a halt."
10,21,CASTIEL,"Rowena.  She needs quiet.  She's under a lot of pressure, and it doesn't help that she feels like she's betraying her friend."
10,21,ROWENA,"Ohh. Betrayal.  Pffft.  She'll get over it.  Once she has children of her own,  she'll know all about betrayal."
10,21,CASTIEL,You have a child?
10,21,ROWENA,Do I have a child?  The King of Hell.  That's all. The King.
10,21,CASTIEL,"Crowley is your son?  Well, that explains a lot.  I'm sure that was quite a challenge."
10,21,ROWENA,"Well, back to it, eh?  We're wasting time in here."
10,21,CASTIEL,I'm gonna . . . see how she's doing.  (Castiel leaves the room to find Charlie gone with her computer.) Charlie?
10,21,ELI,"I know where she is.  Now, I can take care of it for you, if you want.  It'd be my pleasure."
10,21,ELDON,No.  I need to handle this.  Give me the location.
10,21,ELI,"Well, you got a pencil?"
10,21,ELDON,Just spill.
10,21,ELI,A dump called the Blackbird motel.  Registered under the name Carrie Asimov.
10,21,SAM,Hey.  Any sign of him?
10,21,DEAN,"Lot of signs . . . just no him.  I followed the blood trail . . . which, by the way, was like the Mississippi . . . till it ran dry."
10,21,SAM,Meaning what? He bled out?
10,21,DEAN,"Meaning that the trail stopped.  Vanished. Nada.  He sure must have thought he was gonna win that one, 'cause, phew, was he gabby."
10,21,SAM,"Well, I've been going through everything we have on the Frankensteins, and it's just like
Eldon said.  I mean, 1,000 years of nasty.  They made a ton mopping up the black plague.  They started the 100 years war."
10,21,DEAN,"At least the damn book burned.  Right, Sam?  But then, Eldon Frankenstein . . . he hits me with this little fun fact.  He says that the book can't be destroyed.  Says that it can't be sliced, diced, shredded, burned, drowned.  Cannot be destroyed.  Ain't that crazy?  Because . . . I know I saw something burn.  (Sam’s phone starts buzzing on the table) Sam, you answer that, so help me . . ."
10,21,SAM,Hey.
10,21,CASTIEL,"Sam, she's gone."
10,21,SAM,Who's gone?
10,21,CASTIEL,I've looked everywhere.  Charlie is gone.
10,21,CHARLIE,"Ezekiel . . . seven letters.  Seven represents the seeker.  Okay.  Okay.  Saints represent groups of letters that represent numbers . . . that stand for concepts represented by . . . [Her computer displays that she has succeeded] Oh, wow.  I might be a genius."
10,21,ELDON,"I know you're in here, miss Asimov.  You have it. I want it."
10,21,DEAN,"I don't freakin' believe it!  You got Charlie involved with this again, and now she's missing?!"
10,21,SAM,"Charlie, where are you?"
10,21,CHARLIE,"Um, a . . . a motel . . . t-t-the Blackbird.  Sam, someone is here.  T-t-they think I have the book."
10,21,SAM,"If you have the book, give it to them."
10,21,DEAN,Charlie has the damn Book of the Damned?!
10,21,CHARLIE,"No, I don't have it.  I just . . . I, I just . . .
I have my notes."
10,21,SAM,"Then give them your notes, Charlie!  Give them the code . . . whatever they want!"
10,21,DEAN,"(Dean takes the phone away from Sam) Charlie, I don't know what the hell is going on, but you need to listen to me.  Give whoever that is whatever they want. You understand?  Charlie?!"
10,21,CHARLIE,"I can't do that, Dean. [sends her notes in an email to Sam]"
10,21,DEAN,"So, you had the book the whole time?"
10,21,SAM,Dean . . .
10,21,DEAN,. . .lied right to my face.
10,21,SAM,"I thought it was our only chance to get you free of the Mark, so I grabbed it."
10,21,DEAN,I made it real clear how I felt. You ever consider that?
10,21,SAM,"Dean, listen . . ."
10,21,DEAN,And then you pulled Cas into it.  And Charlie.
10,21,SAM,"Charlie loves you, Dean.  We all love you."
10,21,ELDON,You're gonna give me what's mine.  Mine and my family's.
10,21,SAM,"Oh, God."
10,21,DEAN,Charlie?
10,23,CASTIEL,Anything?
10,23,SAM,12 voicemails. LoJack on the Impala has clearly been disabled. So a big heaping scoop of nothing. We need Rowena to hold up her end of the bargain -- now.
10,23,SAM,What?
10,23,CASTIEL,"Nothing. It's -- it's just if she removes the Mark using ""The Book of the Damned""... What of the consequences?"
10,23,SAM,Which are what?
10,23,CASTIEL,Dean said --
10,23,SAM (loudly),"Dean guessed! (Sam takes a breath and exhales loudly (huffs)) Cas, What are we supposed to do, huh? Just sit on our asses, do nothing?"
10,23,CASTIEL,No. We find Dean. (raising his voice)
10,23,SAM (loudly),"And then what?! The only thing that stopped Cain was death. Do you want to kill Dean? Because I don't. And the only way I know how to save my brother is to cure the Mark. And, yes, I know there will be consequences, but not you, not Dean, not anybody can tell me what those consequences are. So I'm not gonna let my brother d-destroy himself on a guess. We save Dean."
10,23,DEAN,Ahh. I'm good.I'm good. (looks anything but good)
10,23,SHERIFF,"Rose McKinley. Raised up about three miles from here. Nice parents, God-fearin' folk."
10,23,DEAN,"Well, they let her leave the house looking like a whore."
10,23,SHERIFF,Whoa.
10,23,SHERIFF,"Why don't you tell me what you really think, Agent?"
10,23,DEAN,"Oh, I'm sorry, Sheriff. My bad."
10,23,SHERIFF,"Let me tell you how we work out here, son. That right there could be the whore of Babylon -- wouldn't make no difference at all. 'Cause all I see is somebody's little girl."
10,23,DEAN,"And I feel like a real jerk suggesting otherwise, Sheriff. My apologies. (not sounding apologetic) (The Sheriff starts walking away) Good luck crackin' the case with your eyes shut."
10,23,SHERIFF,"You worked some pretty dark stuff in your day, haven't you, Agent? Must've left quite a mark."
10,23,DEAN,"Oh, you have no idea."
10,23,RUDY,"Yeah, ain't he, though? Dean-o! Welcome to the party."
10,23,DEAN,"The hell you doing here, Rudy?"
10,23,RUDY,"Ah, you know, (chuckling) just a thing I got for dead girls. Just -- just workin' a gang of fang, you know? Just like you."
10,23,DEAN,"Yeah, not today you're not. I'm gonna need you to take a walk on this one."
10,23,RUDY,"Uh, okay, except, uh -- except I called you, so, uh, if anybody's walking, it's --"
10,23,DEAN,"Oh, you called me? No, no. You begged me. Just like Tuscaloosa, just like Old Lyme, we both know you're playing dress-up out here, and it's just a matter of time before you get yourself killed. So why don't you take that walk and let the real hunters do the work?"
10,23,RUDY,"You know something? Life's too short... Partner. You know, I don't know what crawled up your ass today, but frankly, I don't care. (Walking away) Regards to your brother."
10,23,ROWENA,"Hello, boys. Just in time for tea --u-unless something on your mind?"
10,23,SAM,"Five things, actually. (Sam raised the gun and cocks it) Hollow tips filled with witch-killing brew."
10,23,ROWENA,How exciting for you. Your NRA will be beside themselves with pride.
10,23,SAM,"No more games, Rowena. Do the spell now."
10,23,ROWENA,"Or what exactly? (Sam looks down at his gun) Come on, Samuel! (standing) You and I both know that's nothing but a bluff. Charlie may have cracked the codex, but who's going to read it if I'm gone? Not to mention handling the ingredients, getting the measurements just right – (raising her voice) unless, of course, either of you have spent years of your life studying with the greats, mastering the intricacies of high witchcraft? But forgive me. Maybe you have. I know you're upset. We all are. Poor Dean. Let's just have a nice wee cup of tea... and negotiate."
10,23,ROWENA,"Oh, well, we know what I wanted. Soiled the sheets on that one, didn't we? Let's talk about what I'll take -- my freedom guaranteed and the codex."
10,23,CASTIEL,"Sam, you can't be --"
10,23,SAM,Do you know which spell?
10,23,ROWENA,I do.
10,23,CASTIEL,Sam. This is a mistake.
10,23,MRS. McKINLEY,"Rose and Crystal were friends since... forever it seems. Uh, you think that Crystal could still be in danger?"
10,23,DEAN,"We do, Mrs. McKinley, and the fastest way to find Crystal is to find out who did this to Rose. (Dean places a picture of two young girls on the coffee table) Did you notice any change in her behavior recently -- uh, new friends, a new boyfriend, maybe a crush?"
10,23,MR. McKINLEY,Rose was...a shy girl.
10,23,MRS. McKINLEY,But...you think she might know who did this to her?
10,23,DEAN,"In Rose's case, she not only knew the person, but, uh, she was trying to have intercourse with them. So I'm just trying to figure out whether it was a boyfriend or whether it was just some random roll in the hay."
10,23,MRS. McKINLEY,"No. Uh, there were no relations that we're aware of."
10,23,DEAN,"I'm just doing my job, Mr. McKinley."
10,23,MR. McKINLEY,By suggesting my daughter was a slut?
10,23,DEAN,"I'll admit that thought crossed my mind. Then I came here, and I smelled the deceit and the beatings and the shame that pervade this home."
10,23,MR. McKINLEY,You shut your face right now.
10,23,DEAN,"And you know what? I don't blame Rose anymore. No wonder she put on that skank outfit and went out there looking for validation, right into the arms of the monster that killed her. (Dean looks at Mr. McKinley and in a very calm voice says) Joe, who did this?"
10,23,MRS. McKINLEY,No! Joe!
10,23,DEAN,Who did this?
10,23,MRS. McKINLEY,Stop!
10,23,DEAN,Joe. (Dean cocks his gun and points at Joe’s stomach. Joe looks down) Who did this?
10,23,BOY,Whoa.
10,23,DEAN,"What? Crystal, she's still..."
10,23,DEAN,Why?
10,23,BOY,"There were these guys living out by Cross Creek, said they were rehabbing a cabin out there. (Dean puts his gun away) Mostly, I think they just wanted a place to drink and meet girls."
10,23,DEAN,And Crystal and your sister knew these guys? But you couldn't be bothered to tell the cops that when your sister turned up dead?
10,23,BOY,I was sort of the one who brought them out there in the first place.
10,23,ROWENA,"“Sumsu mimma ezebu ilu ma ikkibu Lu."" ""S-something made by God, but forbidden to man."""
10,23,SAM,Forbidden?
10,23,CASTIEL,The forbidden fruit?
10,23,SAM (huffs),No.
10,23,SAM (incredulously),The actual apple is the first ingredient?
10,23,ROWENA,"“Sumsu mimma ezebu Lu,"""
10,23,SAM,"Okay, uh, what's next?"
10,23,ROWENA,"""Something made by man, but forbidden by God."""
10,23,SAM,"Okay, well, God forbade false idols, right?"
10,23,CASTIEL,The Golden Calf.
10,23,SAM,Wasn't that destroyed?
10,23,ROWENA,"""Sumsu mimma sen arramu."""
10,23,SAM (sarcastically),Great. (clears throat) What's the third ingredient?
10,23,ROWENA,Oh.
10,23,SAM,What?
10,23,ROWENA,"The third ingredient, it's impossible."
10,23,SAM,What is it?
10,23,ROWENA,Loosely translated --my heart.
10,23,CASTIEL,It's not impossible at all.
10,23,ROWENA,"Not my literal heart, feathers. Something I love, the spell calls for me to kill it."
10,23,SAM,A sacrifice.
10,23,ROWENA,"Precisely. The book will grant freedom from the curse, but it wants something in return."
10,23,SAM,"Well, then give it."
10,23,CASTIEL,What about Crowley?
10,23,ROWENA,Happy to kill him. Let's not call it love.
10,23,CASTIEL,I don't believe you. Everyone loves something.
10,23,ROWENA’S VOICE,Oskar! Oskar! Czas Na kolacje!
10,23,CASTIEL,Polish boy. Oskar.
10,23,ROWENA,I'm sorry. Oskar? You saw Oskar?
10,23,SAM,Who is he?
10,23,ROWENA,"Who was he? Uh, a peasant boy -- his family helped me through some difficulties, 300 years ago."
10,23,SAM,Rudy. What's up?
10,23,RUDY,"Wish I could say it was good news, Sam. I just bumped into Dean working a fang banger case in Superior."
10,23,SAM,"Dean's in Nebraska, w-working a case?"
10,23,RUDY,"Yeah, my case. And, uh...He's not playing well with others."
10,23,SAM,"Yeah, Dean's not exactly in the best place right now. You know what? Do me a favor. Just text me the details, would you?"
10,23,RUDY,All right. Whatever you need.
10,23,SAM,Okay. Thanks.
10,23,SAM,"Cas, take this. (Sam hands Castiel a plastic bag) It's Dean's hair. You need it for the spell. Cas, I need you to do this for me. Make the spell happen whatever it takes, please."
10,23,RUDY,"Dean-o, uh, this is Reggie. We're just gonna talk, all right? And -- and come to an understanding."
10,23,REGGIE,"(pointing the knife at Dean) Back your ass out of the room, mister, and leave the blade."
10,23,DEAN,"Yeah. No. Rudy, walk away."
10,23,RUDY (panicking),"No, D-- no, d-Dean-o, just do what he says, okay?"
10,23,DEAN,"He's not gonna kill you. You're his insurance, all right? Now man the hell up and walk away."
10,23,REGGIE,"Oh, I will kill him, friend. You keep yappin', I will."
10,23,DEAN,Do it.
10,23,RUDY,Dean!
10,23,REGGIE,Back up.
10,23,REGGIE,D-don't test me.
10,23,RUDY,"Dean, stop!"
10,23,DEAN,You don't have the guts.
10,23,DEAN,HAH!!!
10,23,CRYSTAL,What did you do?!
10,23,DEAN,"You're Crystal, right? Yeah, well... (Dean cuts the ropes off Crystal’s wrists) I just rescued you."
10,23,CRYSTAL,He -- you could've talked. You just...
10,23,DEAN,You're welcome.
10,23,CRYSTAL,He just let him die. He just let him die. Just let him die.
10,23,SHERIFF,Agent. Maybe you can tell me what in the hell is going on here.
10,23,SHERIFF,"The way the girl outside tells it is one of your boys came in hot, got his partner killed, then went some kind of samurai on that son of a bitch over there. I knew that boy..."
10,23,CROWLEY,Who summons anymore? Couldn't you call?
10,23,CASTIEL,You're not in my contacts list.
10,23,CROWLEY,What?
10,23,CASTIEL,I need your assistance to help cure Dean of the Mark.
10,23,CROWLEY,What's the expression? I gave at the office? Maybe I'd feel a little different if Sam Winchester hadn't just tried to bloody kill me! (raises voice in Crowley ‘signature yell’)
10,23,CASTIEL,"I'm afraid ""no"" is not an acceptable answer."
10,23,CROWLEY,Or what?
10,23,CASTIEL,Or...
10,23,CROWLEY,That's right. Burn those eyes blue. Spread those broken wings and destroy me! Or...Do it my way. (Castiel lowers his hand) Right. Now beg.
10,23,CASTIEL,What?
10,23,CROWLEY,"Blast me, or beg."
10,23,CASTIEL,Crowley.
10,23,CROWLEY,King!
10,23,CASTIEL (annoyed),King. If you --if you would -- if you would be so kind... The three ingredients on this list.
10,23,CROWLEY,"""Forbidden fruit."" Well, for starters, it's a quince, you dummy, not an apple. No problem. ""Golden Calf""... Or what's left of it -- check. ""Something Rowena loves""?"
10,23,CASTIEL,"I would've thought it would've been you, but..."
10,23,CROWLEY,Spare me. I've lived it.
10,23,CASTIEL,Well...
10,23,CROWLEY,I'm in.
10,23,SAM,"Dean, it's me."
10,23,DEAN,"Te nunc invoco, mortem. Te in mea potestate defixi. (There is rumbling in the background and lights inside start popping) Nunc et in aeternum."
10,23,DEATH (off-screen),Don't tell me that's queso.
10,23,DEAN,"Yeah -- yes. Queso and, uh, taquitos, tamales. (Dean brings a tray of food over to Death) Homemade by yours truly. All with the bad fat. (Death sniffs the food) Consider it an offering."
10,23,DEATH,For?
10,23,DEAN,I want you to kill me.
10,23,DEATH,"What I find truly fascinating, Dean... mmm. That's good. ...is that you and I both know that I've been burned by you Winchesters before, yet you still call."
10,23,DEAN,"Yeah, I know, but not this time, okay? (Dean walks over to Death and puts down the tray) No games, no second thoughts. I know you know what this is. (Dean holds out his forearm and Death looks down at the Mark) I know you know what it can do. I've tried to fight it. I've tried to beat it on my own. And I-I can't. I got no moves left -- except you."
10,23,DEATH,"Well, I never thought I'd see the day. (Death sits down) My goodness. Dean Winchester has tipped over his king. But I won't kill you, Dean."
10,23,DEAN,You're death.
10,23,DEATH,And that Mark on your arm is the First Curse. Nothing can kill you.
10,23,DEAN,"Okay, well, forget killing me. Can you get rid of it?"
10,23,DEATH,I could.
10,23,DEAN,But...
10,23,DEATH,Creatio ex nihilo -- God created the earth out of nothing -- or so your Sunday-school teacher would have you believe.
10,23,DEAN,"What, so Genesis is a lie, eh? Shocker."
10,23,DEAN,"Well, that is just fan-friggin-tastic, isn't it?"
10,23,DEATH,"So I could remove the Mark, but only if you will share it with another… (Death leans down so the he is eye to eye with Dean) …to ensure that the lock remains unbroken and the Darkness remains banned."
10,23,DEAN,I'm not doing that... not to anyone.
10,23,SAM,Dean.
10,23,DEAN,"I gave it a shot, Sammy."
10,23,SAM,"Listen to me -- whatever you're doing, whatever you've done, please..."
10,23,DEAN,"Hell, I even worked a case. I gave everything I had to beat this thing down."
10,23,SAM,I saw. I saw Rudy.
10,23,DEAN,"Well, then, you saw what I did."
10,23,SAM,"No, that wasn't you."
10,23,DEAN,"Sure as hell felt like me. (Behind Dean, Death is sitting at a table eating) Brother, I'm done."
10,23,SAM,"No. No, you're not. Dean."
10,23,DEAN,Grab a pen. It's time to say goodbye.
10,23,WAITER,"Get you a refill, Jimmy."
10,23,CROWLEY,Fancy a story?
10,23,CROWLEY,"A long, long time ago, there once lived an evil bitch -- sorry, witch -who was forced to flee her home and her only son because she was, well, horrible. Starving and homeless, she threw herself upon the mercy of a peasant Polish family who took her in, fed her, and nursed her back to full strength. (The waiter looks around nervously) This was a kindness she had never known. She was particularly taken by their 8-year-old son who, apparently, she grew to love. Mm. (pulling over Jimmy’s coffee cup and saucer that was on the counter next to him)"
10,23,WAITER,How do you know all this?
10,23,CROWLEY,"A hamster told me. (Crowley pours sugar into the sup and stirs the contents) Tragically...the boy was terminally ill and soon to die. But before the witch departed, she gave the boy and his family the only thanks that made sense. She cured the boy with one spell and cast another that would take root once he was full-grown. That lying, manipulative whore mother of mine gave you immortality, didn't she...Oskar?"
10,23,SAM,Hey.
10,23,DEAN,Sam.
10,23,SAM,What is this?
10,23,DEAN,We need to talk.
10,23,DEAN (shrugs),"Funny you say that. Truth is, when I left, I thought the only way out was my death. Well, I was wrong, Sam. It's yours."
10,23,SAM,What? He's gonna... Gonna send you into outer space?
10,23,DEAN,"No, well, he didn't say outer space."
10,23,SAM,"This is madness, Dean!"
10,23,DEATH,"Far from it, I'm afraid."
10,23,SAM,No one's asking you.
10,23,DEAN,Hear him out!
10,23,DEATH,"Our conundrum is simple, Sam. Your brother cannot be killed, and the Mark cannot be destroyed, not without inciting a far greater evil than any of us have ever known."
10,23,SAM,What evil?
10,23,DEAN,The Darkness.
10,23,SAM,What the hell is that?
10,23,DEAN,"Well, what does it sound like? Does it sound like a good thing?"
10,23,DEATH,"Even if I remove Dean from the playing field, we're still left with you, loyal, dogged Sam, who I suspect will never rest until he sets his brother free – (Death walks around Dean to stand between Sam and Dean. As he gets closer to Sam, Dean walks further away. Death walks closer to Sam until he is right in his face) will never rest until his brother is free of the Mark, which simply cannot happen, lest the Darkness be set free. Then there was that time you stood me up."
10,23,SAM,You traded my life.
10,23,DEAN,"I'm willing to live with this thing forever, as long as I know that I and it will never hurt another living thing."
10,23,SAM,This isn't you. This doesn't make any sense.
10,23,DEAN,"No, it makes perfect sense if you stop thinking about yourself for one damn minute! (raising his voice)"
10,23,DEATH,"It's for the greater good. Once you consider that, this makes all the sense in the world."
10,23,CROWLEY,"Why the long faces? Oh. Let me guess. Mother showed you her ""mustn't touch it"" again."
10,23,CASTIEL,Do you have the ingredients?
10,23,CROWLEY,"The Quince cost me a major I.O.U. with a Palestinian warlock. (Castiel opens the bag and pulls out its contents and hands the ""quince"" to Rowena) The gold from the calf -- well, let's just say I'll be hanged under certain sexual-deviancy laws if I ever show my face in Jordan again."
10,23,ROWENA,And the third?
10,23,CROWLEY,"Ah, yes. All my long life, I wondered what I'd done to deserve a mother who refused to show love. I pained over it. I built my bloody kingdom on top of it."
10,23,CROWLEY,"Then one day, epiphany struck. My mother was incapable of loving anything. For the first time in hundreds of years, I felt free. And then you showed up in my dungeon, we communed, and I began to realize you weren't incapable of love. You're incapable of loving me."
10,23,ROWENA,"Goodness, Fergus, save it for the stage, why don't you? I mean, fabulous speech, but you put yourself on far too high a pedestal. (Crowley walks away from Castiel and Rowena) The fact remains I do not, will not, and have not loved anything ever."
10,23,CROWLEY,You were saying?
10,23,DEAN,"Remember when we were in that church, making Crowley human, about to close the Gates of Hell? Well, you sure as hell were ready to die for the greater good then."
10,23,SAM,"Yeah, and, Dean, you pulled me back."
10,23,DEAN,"And I was wrong. You were right, Sam. You knew that this world would be better without us in it."
10,23,SAM,"No, no, no, wait a second. You're twisting my words here, Dean."
10,23,DEAN,"Why? Because we -- we track evil and kill it? The family business? Is that it? Look at the tape, Sam. Evil tracks us. And it nukes everything in our vicinity -- our family, our friends. It's time we put a proper name to what we really are and we deal with it."
10,23,SAM,"Wait a second. We are not evil. Listen... We're far from perfect, but we are good. That thing on your arm is evil, but not you, not me."
10,23,DEAN,"I let Rudy die. How was that not evil? I know what I am, Sam. But who were you when you --when you drove that man to sell his soul... Or when you bullied Charlie into getting herself killed? And to what end? A-a good end? A just end? To remove the Mark no matter what the consequences? Sam, how is that not evil? I have this thing on my arm, and you're willing to let the Darkness into the world."
10,23,SAM,"You were also willing to summon death to make sure you could never do any more harm. (Dean smirks and looks away from Sam to Death, who is waiting impatiently) You summoned me because you knew I would do anything to protect you. That's not evil, Dean. That's not an evil man. That is a good man crying to be heard, searching for... some other way."
10,23,DEAN,Good. (Dean grabs his hand with the bandana around it and pulls the bandana off) Good. Fight.
10,23,ROWENA,This is ridiculous.
10,23,CASTIEL,"Do you love this man? Rowena, is it true?"
10,23,CROWLEY,"'Course it's true. Say hello, Oskar."
10,23,OSKAR,Rowena.
10,23,ROWENA,"Even for you, Fergus, this is a new low -- a cruel, shameful, disgusting low."
10,23,CROWLEY,It's only cruel if you actually go through with it. Though... (Oskar looks at Rowena) ...who's the cruel one then?
10,23,DEAN,Aah! Aah!
10,23,DEATH,Please. Do me the honor.
10,23,DEAN,Close your eyes.
10,23,DEAN,"Sammy, close your eyes."
10,23,SAM,Wait.
10,23,SAM,"Take these. And one day, when you find your way back... Let these be your guide. And they can help you remember what it was to be good...what it was to love."
10,23,DEATH,"It's for family you must proceed, Dean."
10,23,DEATH,"To be what you are, to become what you've become is a stain on their memory. Do it. Or I will."
10,23,DEAN,Forgive me.
10,23,ROWENA,You've grown so big. Not too big to give your old auntie Rowena a hug I hope.
10,23,OSKAR,I hope I haven't hurt you.
10,23,ROWENA,"Don't think about that one moment. Everything's fine, Oskar. Everything's fine. (Rowena looks angrily over her shoulder at Crowley as she hugs Oskar. She’s holding a fountain pen in her hand) Nobody's hurting anybody. (Rowena pulls back from their embrace.) Goodbye, my sweet wee boy."
10,23,ROWENA,Ab manu dei... Ab manu hominis.
10,23,DEAN,You okay?
10,23,SAM,I'll live. You?
10,23,DEAN,Fantastic. I think I just killed death.
10,23,ROWENA,"Ab cruore cordis, Mei adfusuro in aeternum. (Rowena’s voice is rising with emotion and anger. Crowley is smiling slightly) Tolle maledictionem tuam ab hoc viro."
10,23,DEAN,That sound right to you?
10,23,DEAN,Aah! Ah.
10,23,ROWENA,Manete!
10,23,ROWENA,To what? Control the legs of a bored king and a withered angel? Impetus bestiarum.
10,23,CROWLEY,Castiel. Don't.
10,23,CROWLEY,Do not. Don't! Please!
10,23,SAM,"This is good. Dean, this is good. The -- the Mark is off your arm. Nothing crazy happened. You get your baby back."
10,23,DEAN (sarcastically),Yeah. I'm sure everything's perfectly fine.
10,23,SAM,What the h--?
10,23,SAM,What did death call this?
10,23,DEAN,The Darkness.
10,23,DEAN,Get in the car.
10,23,SAM,"Yeah. Let's go, let's go!"
10,23,SAM,Dean.
10,23,SAM,Dean!
11,1,DEAN,Hey!  The hell's going on?!
11,1,	DEAN,Hold on!
11,1,DEAN,Yeah.  Where's the car?
11,1,SAM,I-i-it's . . . About a mile that way.
11,1,DEAN,What?
11,1,SAM,Seriously?  The -- the darkness hit.  You disappeared.  You remember none of this?
11,1,SAM,What?  Who?
11,1,DEAN,The Darkness.
11,1,SAM,"Wait a second.  What do you mean, she saved you?"
11,1,DEAN,"You were there. When the storm hit, everything went dark."
11,1,SAM,"Yeah, but you just disappeared from the car."
11,1,DEAN,I don't even remember that.
11,1,SAM,"Well, I don't remember some woman pulling you out."
11,1,DEAN,"Well, what do you want me to say, okay?  I was in the car, and then I wasn't in the car.  I was in the field, and she was there."
11,1,SAM,And she told you she was the darkness.
11,1,DEAN,No. She was wearing a nametag.  What do you think?  She thanked me.
11,1,SAM,For what?
11,1,DEAN,Setting her free.
11,1,SAM,You didn't set her free. I set her free.
11,1,DEAN,"Does it matter?  I mean, yeah, you said the spell, but I had the Mark, so lock and key."
11,1,SAM,"So, what, now she feels indebted to you or something?"
11,1,DEAN,I don't know.  She's a Darkness.  Does she feel anything?
11,1,SAM,And that's all she said?  Thanks?
11,1,DEAN,"Yeah. She was weird.  But she had this energy about her, this -- this focus.  But, yeah, not a talker."
11,1,SAM,So we know jack.
11,1,SAM,You were on a roll.
11,1,DEAN,What the hell happened here?
11,1,SAM,We don't even know what he is.
11,1,DEPUTY (JENNA),Weapons on the ground.  Slow.
11,1,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Easy, officer.  We're FBI, okay?  We got badges."
11,1,DEAN,Huh?
11,1,SAM,What?
11,1,JENNA,Both of you.
11,1,DEAN,"Is this, like, a ""Magic Mike"" moment?"
11,1,JENNA,Your throats!
11,1,SAM,"Oh, you think we're -- we're . . . Look, we don't even know what these are."
11,1,JENNA,I need to know you're not one of 'em.
11,1,DEAN,One of what?
11,1,JENNA,Let's go!
11,1,DEAN,"Okay, all right, look.  Huh? See?"
11,1,JENNA,Good.  Let's see those IDs.
11,1,JENNA,Rebar.  I sought cover.  I fell.
11,1,DEAN,Okay. Why don't you tell us what happened here?
11,1,JENNA,"911 reported a family in distress.  I arrived to find several hostiles attacking said family.  Oh, God, it was horrible."
11,1,DEAN,"How long you been on the job, deputy?"
11,1,JENNA,"Uh . . . Okay, three weeks."
11,1,DEAN,"Okay, ah.  I'm Dean.  This is Sam.  Just breathe. Okay?  Speak plain.  What happened?"
11,1,JENNA,They killed them all.
11,1,SAM,Who?
11,1,JENNA,"Road crew. It was -- they were like rabid dogs.  I fired off a warning, but they didn't stop.  They . . ."
11,1,DEAN,You killed all these?
11,1,JENNA,"I knew some of the boys, but they didn't look -- something was wrong.  They were . . ."
11,1,SAM,They're not human.
11,1,DEAN,"Hey, look, I can stitch that up, but, uh, it's gonna be ugly.  You got a hospital around here?"
11,1,JENNA,Up the road.
11,1,DEAN,All right.  Here we go.
11,1,SAM,"So, what are you thinking?"
11,1,DEAN,"I don't really know what to think.  And I don't know what to expect either, so I'm just gonna chuck it all in."
11,1,SAM,"This is the darkness, right? It's got to be."
11,1,DEAN,"So, what, she shows up and everybody goes ""28 Days Later""?  We didn't."
11,1,SAM,"Yeah, but I was in the car, and you were -- you said she protected you.  So, I mean maybe it wasn't her.  Maybe it was the smoke, and anybody who was outside, like the road crew, they were exposed. I mean, you saw that.  That wasn't human."
11,1,DEAN,"So, what?  The smoke mutated 'em?  Sure, why not?  Just a couple hours ago, I killed Death.  I'm pretty much open for anything.  But mutated into what?  All right, you know what,
one thing at a time.  Let's just get her some help and then we'll deal with whatever comes next."
11,1,DEAN,"No, bad idea.  More people, more bodies.  We'll deal with this."
11,1,DEAN,All right.  You know this place?
11,1,JENNA,This way.
11,1,DEAN,Okay.
11,1,DEAN,This is gonna hurt like a son of a bitch.
11,1,JENNA,"I knew those boys' sisters, their parents."
11,1,DEAN,You did what you were trained to do.  It's all right.
11,1,JENNA,They don't train you to shoot your friends.  I panicked.  I could have . . .
11,1,DEAN,"Those boys weren't boys.  They were monsters, and they were a threat.  Anybody could have panicked.  Not anybody could have done what you did."
11,1,JENNA,This job is supposed to be saving people.
11,1,DEAN,"Yeah, well . . . It sounds better on paper, doesn't it?"
11,1,DEAN,"Well, now that you've said your thanks, let's talk about what happens next."
11,1,DARKNESS,"I like it here.  With you.  I haven't felt this peaceful in a long, long time."
11,1,DEAN,"Well, let's get something straight -- I'm not here to bring you peace.  I know what you are."
11,1,DARKNESS,"Really?  I've been gone so long, I didn't think anyone remembered."
11,1,DEAN,"Well, Death painted a hell of a picture."
11,1,DARKNESS,"I don't know this death, and he doesn't know me."
11,1,DARKNESS,Am I saying that?  Or are you?
11,1,SAM,Hello?  Hello?
11,1,SAM,"Yeah, um . . . Yeah, he's dead.  It's okay to come out.  I'm, uh, FBI.  Here.  I'm gonna slide my badge under the door, okay?"
11,1,MAN,"Help us, please."
11,1,CROWLEY,Vanilla spice?
11,1,MAN,Marn? Down here!
11,1,MARN’S HUSBAND,"You just sit your tush down, okay?  Just let me get this out.  I've been thinking a lot about what you said -- and -- and I know, I lost my chickens when you put it out there.  But it's not every day that your wife tells you that she wants to watch you get a party started with your best friends.  I mean, am I right?"
11,1,CROWLEY,Hmm.  Go on.
11,1,MARN’S HUSBAND,"So, I slept on it
and I prayed on it, and then it came to me. YOLO."
11,1,CROWLEY,YOLO?
11,1,DALE,"""You only live once."""
11,1,CROWLEY,Don't.
11,1,DALE,Sorry.
11,1,MARN’S HUSBAND,"So, I called Dale, and he said . . ."
11,1,DALE,H-E-double-hockey-sticks yeah!
11,1,MARN’S HUSBAND,Dale ran it by Deb . . .
11,1,DEB,We were only gonna get buffet anyway.
11,1,MARN’S HUSBAND,"And here we are.  I didn't think I'd be this nervous, but . . ."
11,1,DALE,"Hey, hey, hey. Don't worry.  We'll be gentle - not!"
11,1,DEB,"Oh, Dale!"
11,1,MARN’S HUSBAND,"Anyhoo, it's your day, birthday girl.  You just say go, and, heck -- we will light this candle."
11,1,CROWLEY,Oh.  It's fine.  Just fine.
11,1,MIKE,"The doc said it was gonna be a tough birth, but Janie . . . she stepped up.  The twister hit, the power went out.  She just kept on going.  No drugs.  Just pushed out this little dewdrop like she was nothing. Then Janie started bleeding.  They tried, but . . . You'd think they'd know how to stop something like that."
11,1,JENNA,"I'm so sorry, Mike."
11,1,DEAN,You think you could tell us what happened here?
11,1,MIKE,"I went outside, after . . . t’collect myself.  A truckload of 'em pulled up."
11,1,SAM,The road crew?
11,1,MIKE,"They didn't say nothing.  They just went off, attacking folks like they were possessed.  I tore back inside to get this little one.  I found that supply closet, and you know, been there since.  I could hear them, though.  Tearing through the halls.  Doctors, nurses -- they didn't care."
11,1,SAM,You said the road crew went nuts.  Did any of them come after you?
11,1,MIKE,"Yeah, a few of them."
11,1,SAM,Did they cut you or bleed on you?
11,1,MIKE,They did.
11,1,JENNA,I don't understand. What are you saying?
11,1,DEAN,"Saying that whatever this is, it might be transmittable."
11,1,JENNA,What? We don't even know what this is.  Now you're saying it can be passed on?
11,1,MIKE,He's right.  I can feel it.  Inside.  Something's happening.
11,1,DEAN,How long has it been since you were attacked?
11,1,MIKE,"Three, four hours.  The real question is, how long till I become like them?"
11,1,CASTIEL,"Brothers, sisters . . . I know I have no right, I have no standing to ask you -- you anything, but these are desperate times, so ask I must.  I confess my transgressions, and I will accept whatever punishment you dole out.  Now, I . . . I ask you to help me.  Please.  Save me from doing worse."
11,1,DEAN,"Well, you know where I stand."
11,1,JENNA,"No, you're not . . . You can't be serious.  And if he goes out there, they'll kill him."
11,1,DEAN,"So, we just wait around for him to kill us?  Oh, yeah, that's -- that's a plan."
11,1,SAM,"Or we just wait for him to die.  There was a -- whatever you want to call it -- a ""rabid"" attacking the closet door, and he just died.  These things have a shelf life."
11,1,DEAN,I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
11,1,JENNA,"No, he's right.  We lock him up, we find a cure.  This is a hospital."
11,1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, call it a hunch, but I don't think you're gonna find this in the medical books."
11,1,MIKE,I didn't open up that closet door to find a cure.
11,1,DEAN,"Look, Mike, I'm sorry, but this is untenable."
11,1,MIKE,I know.  That's why I thought maybe we could make a deal.  I'll go find somewhere quiet and lay low until this is over.  And you save my baby girl.
11,1,DEAN,Yeah.  You've got yourself a deal.
11,1,JENNA,I don't even own a Guinea pig.
11,1,DEAN,Why do I get the feeling that that is gonna bite us in the ass?  You good?
11,1,JENNA,"Oh, yeah. Aces."
11,1,DEAN,"All right, let's gear up."
11,1,JENNA,What's he doing?
11,1,SAM,Dean . . .
11,1,DEAN,We made a promise.
11,1,SAM,"To do what?  Charge out there, guns blazing?  We don't even know how to kill them."
11,1,DEAN,"She does. Chest, right?  I'm guessing heart."
11,1,JENNA,This is madness.
11,1,DEAN,"No.  No, that is madness.  This is horse sense."
11,1,JENNA,"Save Mike's baby, but shoot Mike.  Tell me where that makes sense."
11,1,SAM,"Look, we can just wait for them to die."
11,1,DEAN,"And how long is that?  And when they infect others, how long is that?  No, we stay here, that baby dies.  We did this, Sam.  Okay?  We broke it, we bought it.  You know there's no other way.  (Dean’s phone rings) Where the hell are you, Cas?"
11,1,CASTIEL,I'm...I'm okay.
11,1,DEAN,You don't sound okay.
11,1,CASTIEL,"Dean, I am fine.  Besides, what I have, you can't help me."
11,1,DEAN,"What do you mean, what you have?"
11,1,CASTIEL,Just please tell Sam -- Rowena escaped with the Book of the Damned and the codex.
11,1,DEAN,"Okay, forget Rowena. Where are you?"
11,1,CASTIEL,"Now, you tell me -- the Mark . . ."
11,1,DEAN,"Oh, really? You're worried about me after everything that I’ve --"
11,1,CASTIEL,"Dean, is it gone?"
11,1,DEAN,"Yes. I'm good.  I mean, I'm not great."
11,1,SAM,"Hey, Cas."
11,1,CASTIEL,Sam.
11,1,DEAN,"Okay, your turn.  Talk to us about the darkness."
11,1,CASTIEL,Why would I talk about the darkness?
11,1,SAM,Because it's free.
11,1,CASTIEL,"No, that can't be."
11,1,SAM,Removing the Mark opened some kind of lock.  Dean saw her.
11,1,CASTIEL,The darkness is a woman?
11,1,DEAN,"Well, that's what we're asking you.  We were hoping you could tell us what kind of defcon screwed we are."
11,1,DEAN,Cas?
11,1,DEAN,"Wait, Cas. Cas!"
11,1,JENNA,"FBI, my ass."
11,1,MUSIC,"It's not unusual
to have fun with anyone 
but when I see you
hanging about with anyone 
it's not unusual
to see me cry 
I wanna die 
it's not unusual . . ."
11,1,CROWLEY,Took you long enough.
11,1,MINION 2,We came as soon as you called s- ah . . . What do we call you?
11,1,CROWLEY,King.  What about the other white meatsuit?
11,1,MINION 2,Secured. We have another team and a witch removing Rowena's immobilization spell as we speak.
11,1,CROWLEY,Hmm.  Is anybody hot?  I'm hot.
11,1,MINION 2,"I believe that's the menopause, sir."
11,1,CROWLEY,Thank you.  What!
11,1,MINION 1,"Uh, it's nothing, sir."
11,1,CROWLEY,Speak.
11,1,MINION 1,"It's just, you barely escaped assassination.  You're arguably on the run from the most powerful witch on earth -- not to mention an angel of heaven and ah . . ."
11,1,CROWLEY,"And, ah . . . ?"
11,1,MINION 1,Y-you didn't call for help until after the orgy?
11,1,CROWLEY,Hmp.  I apologize . . . For nothing.
11,1,SAM,"Look, I get it.  I do.  We're gonna save that baby, okay?  And we're gonna find Cas, and
we're gonna stop the darkness."
11,1,DEAN,"Okay, so what are we talking about?"
11,1,SAM,The plan.
11,1,DEAN,"We have a plan, okay?  It's the same plan as it's always been.  In order to get out, we go through."
11,1,SAM,And?  How's that been working for us?
11,1,DEAN,"We can't save Cas if we're stuck in some hospital, okay?  Just like I can't strap on a time machine, go back, and tell Cain to shove that Mark up his ass or stop you from releasing the darkness.  Now, have we made mistakes?  Yes. Hell, yes.  And we can analyze each and every one of them over a couple of frosties when we're old and farting sawdust and out of this room!  Right now, all I can do is I can gear up, I can head out, and I can save that freaking baby, which is exactly what I'm gonna do."
11,1,SAM,When did we forget how to do this?
11,1,DEAN,What?
11,1,SAM,"Dean, if we don't change -- right now -- all of our crap is just gonna keep repeating itself."
11,1,DEAN,"Okay, I-I don't even -- what?"
11,1,SAM,"This -- this ""kill first, question later.""  What happened to us?  Hunting things -- we're good at that.  Sure, we're great at that.  But that's only half of the bumper sticker, man."
11,1,DEAN,"Sam, I am trying to save that baby."
11,1,SAM,And what about the others out there?
11,1,DEAN,You mean the ones trying to kill us?
11,1,SAM,"I mean the ones that are sick, the ones that are dying."
11,1,DEAN,"Yeah, who won't rest until they've infected us all."
11,1,SAM,So we just forget about a cure?
11,1,SAM,There is always a cure.  You just have to want to find it.
11,1,DEAN,"Yeah, how are you gonna find it if you're dead?  And around and around we go."
11,1,SAM,"Saving people means all of the people, Dean.  Not just that baby.  Not just each other.  I unleashed a force on this world that could destroy it . . . to save you."
11,1,DEAN,And I told you not to.
11,1,SAM,"And I'd do it again.  In a second, I would do it again.  And that is what I'm talking about.  This isn't on you.  It is on us.  We have to change."
11,1,DEAN,What are you thinking?
11,1,SAM,Get Jenna to the car.  Get her and the baby somewhere safe.
11,1,DEAN,Without a shot.  And what are we gonna do about those things on our tail?
11,1,SAM,They won't be on your tail.
11,1,DEAN,No way.
11,1,SAM,"You said it, Dean.  We broke this."
11,1,DEAN,"Yeah, we broke this, okay?  We did."
11,1,SAM,"I heard it in your voice when you agreed to take that child.  I get it.  You do what you do.  But you've got to let me do what I do, too."
11,1,DEAN,Come on.
11,1,MIKE,The baby.
11,1,JENNA,No.
11,1,MIKE,The baby.
11,1,DEAN,"No.  We're not gonna hurt you, Mike.  As long as you leave that baby alone.  Mike."
11,1,MIKE,Amara.
11,1,JENNA,What?
11,1,MIKE,Her name . . . is Amara. (Mike keels over and dies; Jenna and Dean leave the hospital)
11,1,CROWLEY,Ahh.  Daddy's home.  What?
11,1,MINION 2,Sir . . . There are rumors from Hell.
11,1,CROWLEY,Rumors?
11,1,CROWLEY,"The Darkness?  Please. Myth. It's a bedtime story.  Something that daddy demons threaten toddler demons with to get them to eat their vegetables.  Even if it was true, what's the concern?  Darkness, King of Hell -- natural allies."
11,1,MINION 1,"It's just -- something happened, sir . . . In the cage."
11,1,CROWLEY,What?
11,1,CROWLEY,About the darkness.  Ridiculous.
11,1,MINION 2,"Except . . . Half of Hell is sort of freaking out, sir.  What do we do?"
11,1,ANGEL,"After Metatron escaped, we moved the door to heaven."
11,1,CASTIEL,"Yeah, smart."
11,1,ANGEL,"You know, to prevent further incidents."
11,1,DEAN,"Oh, you good?"
11,1,JENNA,Yeah.  Baby. Poop.  What could go wrong?
11,1,DEAN,Godspeed.
11,1,JENNA,I have no idea what I'm doing.
11,1,DEAN,"Right.  Listen, I know things might seem dark right now -- hell, call it pitch-black.  And you may not be able to see it, but your way back is right there.  You and her.  You're gonna help each other."
11,1,JENNA,Joy comes in the morning.  My grandma leads a Bible study.
11,1,DEAN,"Ah.  Well, let's go with that."
11,1,SAM,"Hey, you good?"
11,1,DEAN,"Yeah, about 40 miles outside of town.  As far as I can tell, it's isolated to Superior."
11,1,SAM,"Well, that's something."
11,1,DEAN,How about you?  You okay?
11,1,SAM,"What'd you expect?  Like it or not, I'm gonna find a cure."
11,1,DEAN,"Yeah, I know you are.  Man, things are screwy right now.  I know we don't have any answers, but at least we got one win, you know?"
11,1,SAM,I hear you.
11,1,DEAN,"All right, I'm gonna run Jenna up to her grandmother's.  Shouldn't be more than a few hours.  Then we clean up that town.  We find the Darkness, and we kick her ass."
11,1,SAM,"Yeah, that's great, Dean.  That um . . . sounds like a plan."
11,1,DEAN,"If you're as bad as they say you are, why haven't you hurt me?"
11,1,DARKNESS,"For the same reason that you'll never hurt me.  (She pulls aside her dress to show the Mark of Cain on her collarbone) We're bound, Dean.  We'll always be bound.  You helped me.  I helped you.  No matter where I am, who I am . . . We will always help each other."
11,2,VIDEO,"H-a-t-e.  It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low.  L-o-v-e. You see these fingers?  They're arched.  These fingers has veins that run straight to the soul of man. The right hand, friends -- the hand of love.  Now watch, and I'll show you the story of life.  These fingers, dear hearts, is always a-warrin' and a-tuggin', one against the other.  Now watch 'em.  Old brother left hand -- left hand hates a-fightin'."
11,2,SAM,Can you talk?
11,2,RADIO,And it looks like love's a goner.
11,2,SAM,Or are you too far gone?
11,2,RADIO,But wait a minute.
11,2,MAN,What?
11,2,VIDEO,"Wait a minute.  Hot dog!  Love's a-winnin'.  Yes, siree.  It's love that won.  And old left-hand hate is down for the count."
11,2,SAM,Good answer.
11,2,DEAN,"Well, nice neighborhood."
11,2,JENNA,Yeah.  I pretty much grew up here.  Learned to ride my bike down the road.  Had my first kiss at that blue house over there.  Lost my virginity up there.
11,2,DEAN,I'll bet blue house was pissed.
11,2,DEAN,"Yeah.  Hey, beautiful."
11,2,JENNA,"Anyway . . .   That's why I asked you to bring us here.  After everything that happened, it just feels safe."
11,2,JENNA,You're so great with her.
11,2,DEAN,"Well, what can I say?  Chicks dig me.  Well, look, I should, uh . . ."
11,2,JENNA,Right. Sure.
11,2,DEAN,"You're gonna be okay, both of you."
11,2,JENNA,I know.  What about you and Sam?  Are you gonna be okay?
11,2,DEAN,"Well, for us, the bar's pretty low.  See ya."
11,2,JENNA,Dean.  Thank you . . . For everything.
11,2,JENNA,"Hi, grandma."
11,2,GRANDMA,"After you called, they did a big report on the news.  That weatherman I don't like with the big teeth, he said some kind of freak storm hit Superior."
11,2,JENNA,Yeah.  It was . . . crazy.
11,2,GRANDMA,"Well, don't you worry.  If that thing rolls our way, I've got a generator and enough canned green beans to last till Judgment Day."
11,2,JENNA,Good to know.
11,2,GRANDMA,And this must be Amara.  Oh.  What a little angel.
11,2,JENNA,Yeah.  She's a miracle.
11,2,GRANDMA,And her folks?
11,2,JENNA,It's a long story.
11,2,GRANDMA,"Well, then it can wait till after your nap."
11,2,JENNA,My what?
11,2,GRANDMA,"When's the last time you slept?  Because -- and I mean this is the nicest possible way -- you look like poop on parade.  Now, I made up the guest bedroom, and I got your father's old crib out for the baby, so I will put her down -- yes, I will -- while you go upstairs and have a rest, all right? Sh sh sh sh."
11,2,JENNA,"Honestly, a nap sounds awesome right now."
11,2,GRANDMA,"Well, then, you just go right upstairs, Missy."
11,2,JENNA,Thank you.
11,2,SAM,What's your name?
11,2,RABID MAN,Bite me.
11,2,SAM,"Okay, ""Bite Me,"" how long have you been infected?"
11,2,RABID MAN,Could ask you the same thing.  We smell our own.
11,2,SAM,Answer the question.
11,2,RABID MAN,Why?  'Cause you want to know how much time you got left?
11,2,SAM,I want to know everything.
11,2,RABID MAN,Uh-huh.  What's in it for me?
11,2,SAM,"Well, if I can find a cure --"
11,2,RABID MAN,"""If.""  I want something real . . . something I can hold in my hands."
11,2,SAM,Like what?
11,2,SAM,I was infected last night.  You?
11,2,RABID MAN,This morning.
11,2,SAM,Wait a second.  Then why --
11,2,RABID MAN,". . . am I further along?  Don't know.  This thing, it ain't math.  I seen some people  change fast, some change slow.  But in the end . . . We all end up the same.  We go psycho.  And then we go boom."
11,2,SAM,"Well, that's not -- I'm gonna fix this."
11,2,RABID MAN,"LIAR! You and me, we're dead.  We're just taking our sweet time about it.  So if you were smart, you'd put a bullet in me . . . and then eat one yourself."
11,2,DEAN,"Come on, Cas."
11,2,EFRAM,"Hmm.  ""Dean."""
11,2,JONAH,As in Winchester?
11,2,CASTIEL,Efram.  Jonah.  What's -- what's happening?
11,2,JONAH,"We have questions for you, Castiel."
11,2,CASTIEL,Why am I . . . I asked for help.
11,2,EFRAM,And I asked for a vessel that didn't have psoriasis.  Crap happens.
11,2,CASTIEL,No.
11,2,JONAH,No what?
11,2,CASTIEL,No.  You don't understand.  I'm cursed.  You should run.
11,2,GRANDMA,Did you hear that?  Sounded like raccoons--
11,2,JENNA,That was not a raccoon.
11,2,GRANDMA,"Mary, mother -- no, Jenna, don't!  Jenna, no!  The devil's in that girl!"
11,2,JENNA,What?
11,2,GRANDMA,I'm calling Father Wyatt.
11,2,JENNA,"Grandma, no."
11,2,GRANDMA,"Well, who are we gonna call?"
11,2,DEAN,"Ghostbusters.  Jenna, hey.  Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.  What's wrong?"
11,2,SAM,"I mean, it sounds like something out of ""The Exorcist."""
11,2,DEAN,That's what I said.
11,2,SAM,So you thinking demon?
11,2,DEAN,"Or kid got infected by something.  You know, who knows what was in that giant, crazy fart?"
11,2,SAM,Wow. Vivid. Thanks.
11,2,DEAN,"Look, man, I know you're flying solo."
11,2,SAM,"No, I'm -- I'm fine, Dean.  Look, don't -- don't worry about me.  Just help Jenna.  And if you need anything, then call me."
11,2,DEAN,"Will do. How you doing? How's ""Zombieland""?"
11,2,SAM,It's good.  It's great.
11,2,EFRAM,Where's Metatron?
11,2,CASTIEL,I don't know.
11,2,EFRAM,"Where's Metatron, Castiel?"
11,2,CASTIEL,"Mercy, brother, please!"
11,2,EFRAM,Brother? Ha!  What are you?
11,2,CASTIEL,W-what?  I'm an angel of the Lord.
11,2,EFRAM,"That so?  'Cause, near as I can tell, when you have to choose between heaven and the Winchesters . . ."
11,2,JONAH,You choose them.
11,2,EFRAM,"Every time.  So, see, you're not my brother.  And if I had it my way, I'd take this blade, stick it in your heart . . . and call that a damn good day."
11,2,CASTIEL,Then do it!
11,2,EFRAM,Nah.  The fun's just getting started.
11,2,CASTIEL,No!
11,2,BILLIE,"O death, o death, o death 
won't you spare me over another year?
Oh, what is this that I can't see 
with ice-cold hands taking hold of me?
When God is gone and the devil takes hold 
who'll have mercy on your soul?”"
11,2,BILLIE,"Hey, Sam."
11,2,SAM,How do you know my name?  Who are you?
11,2,BILLIE,"Mm.  Think you mean ""what?""  Here's a hint.  You and your brother been real good for business lately."
11,2,SAM,You're a Reaper.
11,2,BILLIE,The circle gets the square.
11,2,SAM,What's your name?
11,2,BILLIE,"Mm, you flirtin' with me, kid?  ‘Cause, no offense, but you ain't my type.  And I'm not looking to get friendly with the man who helped gut my boss."
11,2,SAM,I'm sorry about Death.
11,2,BILLIE,"So am I.  But people are still dying, so . . . work to do, souls to collect . . . Messages to deliver."
11,2,SAM,What kind of messages?
11,2,BILLIE,It's over.
11,2,SAM,What's over?
11,2,BILLIE,"You and Dean . . . Dying and coming back again and again.  The old death thought it was funny.  But now there's one hard, fast rule in this universe.  What lives . . . dies.  So the next time you or your brother bite it, well, you're not going to Heaven . . . Or Hell.  One of us -- and, Lord, I hope it's me -- we're gonna make a mistake and toss you out into the Empty.  And nothing comes back from that.  I know you're dying.  I can feel it.  You're unclean in the biblical sense.  So I'll be seeing you again, Sam . . . Seeing you real soon.  Name's Billie, by the way."
11,2,EFRAM,"Again, Metatron -- where is he?"
11,2,CASTIEL,I don't know.
11,2,JONAH,But you broke him out of heaven.
11,2,CASTIEL,Yes.
11,2,JONAH,And took his Grace.
11,2,CASTIEL,Yes.
11,2,EFRAM,"And you expect us to believe he, what, just gave you the slip -- no powers, no wings?"
11,2,CASTIEL,Metatron tricked me.
11,2,EFRAM,So you're just stupid.
11,2,JONAH,Or he's lying.
11,2,EFRAM,Or that.
11,2,JONAH,One way to find out.
11,2,EFRAM,What should we cut off first?  Eeny? Meeny? Miny?  Or Moe?
11,2,HANNAH,That's enough.
11,2,CASTIEL,Hannah.
11,2,HANNAH,What are you doing?
11,2,EFRAM,Getting answers.
11,2,HANNAH,No.  This isn't how we do things.  Get out.  Out!
11,2,CASTIEL,Thank you.
11,2,HANNAH,"Don't thank me yet.  Something's happened, Castiel -- something horrible."
11,2,SAM,"So . . . I know it's been a long time, but . . . Dean and I, we've -- we've been through a lot of bad.  But this is different.  This is my fault, and I don't know how to fix it.  And if I have to die, I've made my peace with that, but . . . Please.  Dean deserves better.  Dean deserves a life.  There are people out there, good people, who are going to suffer because of me, and I am not asking you to clean up my mess.  Hell, I don't even know if you're out there, but . . . If you are . . . And if you can hear me, I, um . . . We need your help, God.  We need to know there's hope.  We need a sign."
11,2,SAM,What does that mean?!
11,2,DEAN,Hey.  Where's the kid?
11,2,JENNA,We got another problem.
11,2,DEAN,Figures.
11,2,JENNA,"I tried to stop her, but my grandma's real Catholic, and after the crazy, she called her priest, who sent over an exorcist."
11,2,DEAN,Really?
11,2,JENNA,Yeah.
11,2,CROWLEY,"Hello, my son."
11,2,DEAN,Crowley.
11,2,CROWLEY,“Father” Crowley.
11,2,JENNA,Do you know each other?
11,2,CROWLEY,"Oh, yes.  Dean was a rather scrumptious young altar boy."
11,2,DEAN,Can I talk to you outside . . . Father?
11,2,CROWLEY,Of course.  After I finish my tea.
11,2,CASTIEL,No.  This is safer.  I wasn't lying about Metatron.
11,2,HANNAH,"I know.  But right now, I'm more worried about you."
11,2,CASTIEL,Can you heal me?
11,2,HANNAH,I can't.  I'm sorry.  This -- it's . . . powerful magic.
11,2,DEAN,Really? Father Crowley?  Really?
11,2,CROWLEY,"I'm sorry, aging, pathetic, has-been rock star.  Did I offend your delicate sensibilities?  Where have you been?  Your brother and that idiot angel, do you know what they've been doing?"
11,2,DEAN,I've heard.
11,2,CROWLEY,Everything?
11,2,DEAN,Enough. What are you doing here?
11,2,CROWLEY,Same as you -- I'm working the case.
11,2,CASTIEL,"I feel the spell just cutting deeper and deeper, and I'm trying to fight it.  I'm trying, but --"
11,2,HANNAH,"Does it have anything to do with the disturbance in Superior, Nebraska?"
11,2,CASTIEL,You know about that?
11,2,HANNAH,"Alarms have been sounding in heaven, Castiel -- alarms that haven't gone off in . . . ever.  We don't even know what they mean."
11,2,CASTIEL,Those alarms are for the Darkness.
11,2,HANNAH,The Darkness is a story.
11,2,CASTIEL,"No, it's not.  It's real.  The Darkness . . . It's been locked away since the dawn of creation.  And now it's free."
11,2,JENNA,"Whatever's wrong, Dean will fix it."
11,2,HANNAH,God help us.
11,2,CASTIEL,I wouldn't count on that.
11,2,JENNA,"Yeah, it's okay."
11,2,HANNAH,Where is it?
11,2,CASTIEL,I don't know.
11,2,HANNAH,"Then who would?  The Winchesters?  Castiel, if this is true, it's the end for all of us.  Sam and Dean -- where are they?"
11,2,CASTIEL,I don't know.
11,2,HANNAH,Then think harder!
11,2,CASTIEL,How did you find me?
11,2,CROWLEY,"I have sources in the Catholic church -- nuns that owe me a favor, priests with a taste for --"
11,2,DEAN,"Okay, all right, yeah, I can imagine."
11,2,CROWLEY,"You really can't.  Anyhow, they hear of a demonic possession, they call me.  If it's one of mine, I tell them to ignore it.  If it's a, uh, demon gone rogue, well, that's when Father Crowley comes out to play."
11,2,DEAN,So you think there's a demon in there.
11,2,CROWLEY,Not even a little bit.
11,2,HANNAH,I saved you.
11,2,CASTIEL,"No.  I don't think you did.  I think that you told Efram and Jonah to bring me here and to hurt me, and so you arranged to -- to . . . to burst in and save me.  You were hoping that I would be so grateful that I would do anything you said, that I would tell you anything that you wanted to know.  Why, Hannah?  We were friends."
11,2,HANNAH,"That was before you freed Metatron . . . Before . . . The other angels, they hate you."
11,2,CASTIEL,And what about you?  Do you hate me?
11,2,CASTIEL,I won't give you Sam and Dean.
11,2,EFRAM,Sure you will.
11,2,JONAH,We're gonna hack your brain.
11,2,CROWLEY,"Whatever's in that house, I can taste the power radiating from it."
11,2,GRANDMA,"Oh, Jenna!  Oh! You scared me."
11,2,CROWLEY,That thing . . . It's old . . .
11,2,GRANDMA,"What'd you do, drop a bowling ball up there?"
11,2,CROWLEY,. . . deep . . .
11,2,GRANDMA,Jenna?
11,2,CROWLEY,. . . dark.
11,2,GRANDMA,"Honey, are you all right?"
11,2,JENNA,I always wanted to try this.
11,2,GRANDMA,*screams*
11,2,DEAN,Jenna?  Jenna!
11,2,CROWLEY,"Well, hello, plot twist."
11,2,EFRAM,Anything?
11,2,JONAH,Not yet.
11,2,EFRAM,You said you knew how to do this.
11,2,JONAH,I watched Naomi . . . Once.
11,2,HANNAH,Enough!
11,2,EFRAM,"Look, you don't want to get your pretty hands dirty, fine.  Walk away.  But this is happening. Gimme.  Now hold still.  This one might hurt."
11,2,HANNAH,I said stop.
11,2,EFRAM,"You get in my way again . . . You touch me again, and I . . ."
11,2,EFRAM,. . . will . . . end you!
11,2,HANNAH,Castiel.
11,2,CASTIEL,No!
11,2,EFRAM,Aah!
11,2,CASTIEL,No! No!
11,2,VOICE,"Sam, Sam. Sam. Sam."
11,2,DEAN,Jen!  Jenna!
11,2,CROWLEY,Really?
11,2,DEAN,What?
11,2,CROWLEY,"We have no idea what ancient, world-shattering evil we're dealing with, but go right ahead.  Let him know we're coming!"
11,2,DEAN,"Listen, Velma, this isn't the Scooby gang, okay?  So either shut up or get out."
11,2,Flashback,Dean flashes back to his conversation with the Darkness when he opens Amara’s onesie and finds the Mark of Cain on her collarbone.
11,2,DARKNESS,"We're bound, Dean.  We'll always be bound.  We will always help each other."
11,2,CROWLEY,"The child likes you.  No surprise, really.  You're very maternal."
11,2,DEAN,We gotta find Jenna.
11,2,RADIO,"There's a crazy little shack beyond the tracks 
and everybody calls it the sugar shack 
well, it's just a coffeehouse and it's made out of wood 
Espresso coffee tastes mighty good 
that's not the reason why I've got to get back"
11,2,RABIDS,Ohh!  Whoa!  *more grunting and crying out while the Darkness burns out of them*
11,2,SAM,Hey.
11,2,WOMAN,Thank you.
11,2,SAM,Let's go save the rest of them.
11,2,CROWLEY,Drama.
11,2,DEAN,Jenna?  What are you doing?
11,2,JENNA,"My grandma collected these things, but I always thought they were so . . . Blah.  Don't worry.  She won't care.  I cut her throat."
11,2,DEAN,Why did you do that?
11,2,CROWLEY,Because this woman doesn't have a soul.  Fascinating.
11,2,DEAN,What are you talking about?  How is that even possible?
11,2,JENNA,Amara's hungry.  She's a growing girl.
11,2,DEAN,"Jenna.  Listen to me.  Whatever's happened, whatever's going on, we can fix it, okay?"
11,2,JENNA,But I don't want to be fixed.  I like the new me.  She's a ball.
11,2,DEAN,"Just come with us, okay?  Jenna! Stop!"
11,2,CROWLEY,I was getting bored.
11,2,DEAN,You killed her!
11,2,CROWLEY,You're welcome.
11,2,DEAN,Where are you going?
11,2,CROWLEY,To see the child that eats souls.
11,2,DEAN,You don't get what that thing is.
11,2,CROWLEY,"Enlighten me.  Come on, darling. Don't play coy."
11,2,DEAN,I think Amara is the Darkness.
11,2,CROWLEY,"Interesting.  So, what now?  You kill her? You?"
11,2,DEAN,I don't have a choice.
11,2,CROWLEY,"Please.  Even if you could murder a baby, you couldn't murder that baby.  I saw the way you looked at her.  Me, on the other hand, it's not like it'd be my first."
11,2,DEAN,"Oh, is that an offer?  It's a promise -- right after I'm done with her."
11,2,DEAN,Stay away from her!
11,2,CROWLEY,"Oh, Dean.  Adorable little Dean.  I want that child, and I get what I want.  You and Sam don't understand.  I'm not your bloody sidekick!  We've had some good times.  So I'm gonna give you one chance -- just one -- to walk out that door, or I'm gonna take you apart atom by atom.  Do you understa-- Aah!  Bastard!"
11,2,SAM,"All right, I still don't understand.  I mean, I thought the darkness was a woman, not a child."
11,2,DEAN,"Well, same here.  I don't know. Maybe whatever I saw wasn't real.  Maybe it was a vision."
11,2,SAM,Vision?
11,2,DEAN,Yeah.
11,2,SAM,Huh.  Pretty weird.
11,2,DEAN,"Yeah, weird with a weird cherry on a weird top.  We got to get maid.  But, you know, one with a-a little uniform  and really big, uh --"
11,2,CASTIEL,Help me.
11,2,CROWLEY,"My, haven't you grown into a sweet young thing?  Want some candy, little girl?"
11,4,THEN,
11,4,CHUCK,"On April 21, 1967, the hundredth millionth GM vehicle rolled off the line at the plant in Janesville.  Three days later, another car rolled off that same line.  This 1967 Chevrolet impala would turn out to be the most important object in pretty much the whole universe."
11,4,DEAN,(To Sam after he’s just rebuilt the whole Impala) Whoo! Listen to her purr.
11,4,DEAN,(To Young!John Winchester when he’s purchasing a car) This is the car you want.
11,4,JOHN,"Oh, yeah? You -- you know something about cars?"
11,4,DEAN,My dad taught me everything about cars.
11,4,SAM,"(praying in the church) I know it's been a long time.  Dean and I, we've -- we've been through a lot of bad, but this is different.  This is my fault, and I don't know how to fix it.  We need your help, God.  We need to know there's hope."
11,4,SAM,Hey.
11,4,DEAN,Hey.
11,4,SAM,"Dude, what's up with the shorts?"
11,4,DEAN,It's a free bunker.  Did you find anything?
11,4,SAM,Uh . . . Not on the Darkness. No.
11,4,DEAN,What about Metatron?
11,4,SAM,Still in the wind.  No leads.
11,4,DEAN,"Great.  So we have an ancient evil out there somewhere, just getting stronger by the day."
11,4,SAM,"Cas is getting better, so there's that.  Still wants to fix your, uh --"
11,4,DEAN,I'm fine. Fine. 100%.
11,4,SAM,"All right, well, he's not.  He still needs more time to heal."
11,4,DEAN,"Well . . . Guess we got nothing to do but get better.  I don't know about you,"
11,4,SAM,"Well, I may have found us a case.  I mean, it's thin --"
11,4,DEAN,"Hey, thin works.  Tell me on the way."
11,4,Int. Impala,Sam and Dean drive down the highway in the rain and get a phone call from Castiel.
11,4,DEAN,"Figures.  All right, let's hear it.  What do you got?"
11,4,SAM,"Okay, uh, Quaker Valley, Oregon, town outside of Eugene.  Dwayne Markham, the local sheriff, was found in the woods a couple days ago.  His body was mauled, so they chalked it up to an animal attack, but I'm thinking --"
11,4,DEAN,Werewolf.
11,4,SAM,"Yeah, maybe."
11,4,DEAN,"Yeah, you're right. That is thin."
11,4,SAM,"Yeah. Probably nothing, right?"
11,4,DEAN,"Probably not.  Oregon, here we come."
11,4,DEAN,What is that?
11,4,SAM,It's a smoothie.
11,4,DEAN,Where's the beer?
11,4,SAM,Under the smoothies.
11,4,DEAN,Where's the rest of the beer?
11,4,SAM,"(cell phone ringing) Ooh, it's Cas.  We gotta -- we gotta --"
11,4,DEAN,Man!
11,4,SAM,"I gotta get this. Hey, Cas. Everything all right?"
11,4,CASTIEL,"Yeah, I'm fine.  I was just reading up about the other cases in the area that you're headed to.  I haven't found anything yet that matches."
11,4,DEAN,"Cas, you've got one job to do and that's to heal.  You understand?"
11,4,CASTIEL,I can help.
11,4,SAM,"Yeah, of course you can, Cas, but right now is the time for you to focus on getting better.  This is just a milk run.  We got it. So . . . Try and relax."
11,4,CASTIEL,All right.
11,4,SAM,"Read a book, watch some Netflix."
11,4,CASTIEL,What's a “Netflix”?
11,4,SAM,"Go to my room, turn on the TV.  You'll figure it out."
11,4,CASTIEL,All right.  Just call if you need anything.
11,4,DEAN,"Got it, Cas. Thanks."
11,4,SAM,You think he's gonna be okay?
11,4,DEAN,"He just needs some time, you know?  We all do."
11,4,SAM,"Are you serious?  Dean, it's late. I'm exhausted and -- and -- starving.  And this place . . . I mean, even Swayze wouldn't come to this roadhouse."
11,4,DEAN,"Okay, first of all, never use Swayze's name in vain.  Okay? Ever.  Second, you don't remember this place?  You don't remember Heather?  The hunter that we worked a wendigo case a couple years ago?"
11,4,SAM,"Oh, yeah."
11,4,DEAN,"Yeah, exactly."
11,4,SAM,"What, she's here tonight?"
11,4,DEAN,"I texted her. She's working a rugaru case in Texas.  Actually, she never texted me back. That's not the point.  The point is, is that we have a ton of driving left to do just to go to a town where there's probably not a case.  But in there . . . Good times.  And time heals all wounds, Sam, especially good times.  What do you say?"
11,4,SAM,"I say, knock yourself out.  I'm gonna find a diner, dig into the lore like Cas did, see if anything's ever happened where we're headed."
11,4,DEAN,"Oh, man, you really gotta learn to have fun.  Seriously, it's pathetic."
11,4,DEAN,Mistakes were made. Mm-hmm.
11,4,PIPER,Who are you?
11,4,DEAN,Oh!
11,4,SAM,"Ah, good morning.  That's, uh, my brother Dean."
11,4,DEAN,"Sorry, Sam, I didn't -- I didn't realize you had company."
11,4,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, uh, could you give us a minute?"
11,4,DEAN,"Hi.  Well, I'll just, uh . . . Just won't be here anymore.  So you kids take your time."
11,4,PIPER,Have you seen my hairpin?
11,4,Int. Impala,Dean and Sam are leaving the parking lot of the Roadhouse.  Dean puts in a tape.
11,4,SAM,"Dean, I can explain what was going on --"
11,4,DEAN,"No, no, no. No."
11,4,SAM,"Don't ""Night Moves"" me."
11,4,DEAN,Shh.  Just let it wash over you.
11,4,SAM,Let . . .
11,4,DEAN,Just take it in.
11,4,SAM,This is ridiculous.
11,4,DEAN,"One of the greatest rock writers of all time, Samuel."
11,4,SAM,It’s Sam.
11,4,SAM,(sings) Out in the back seat of my brother’s ’67 Chevy
11,4,SAM,"Yeah, you started this.  You started this."
11,4,DEAN,Here we go. Come on now.
11,4,Int. Impala,Sam and Dean are eating and laughing together.  “Night Moves” plays through the scene shift.
11,4,SAM,"Next time, I choose.  Hey . . ."
11,4,DEAN,Hands off the wheel.
11,4,SAM,You're not even looking at the road.
11,4,DEAN,"""Digging into tho lore.""  Is that what the kids are calling it these days?"
11,4,SAM,"Man, I needed that."
11,4,DEAN,"And hey, look at that, you're finally not a virgin anymore.  But you know what?  I think it was time. I respect the fact that you, uh, you know, you wanted to stay true and pure and waited."
11,4,SAM,"Yeah, you know what?  You -- you're an idiot."
11,4,DEAN,"Even put a blanket down.  Buddy, classy and thoughtful as always."
11,4,SAM,I tried to give her my number.  You know what she said?
11,4,DEAN,"""We got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow""?"
11,4,SAM,Is everything a Bob Seger song to you?
11,4,DEAN,Yes.  Well . . . [ sighs ]
11,4,SAM,"It was nice knowing you, Piper."
11,4,DEAN,"Piper?  That's awesome.  Heather.  One-night wonders, man.  Shoot, we're lucky we still get that at all."
11,4,SAM,Really? You don't . . . Ever want something more?
11,4,DEAN,"I'm sorry, have you met us?  We're batting a whopping zero in domestic life, man. Goose eggs."
11,4,SAM,"You don't ever think about something?  Not marriage or whatever.  But . . . Something?  You know, with a hunter?  Somebody who understands the life?"
11,4,DEAN,"Have you not heard a single word Bob's been singing about?  You're tired. I can tell.  You're exhausted.  Well, I'm still wired, so I'm gonna pull over, get some gas.  You hop in the back, get some Z's 'cause, buddy, you earned 'em.  Proud of ya! Piper. Mmm.  Man, she smelled good, too."
11,4,Int. Impala,Sam wakes up from sleeping against the window to Young John Winchester driving the car and Judy Collins’ “Someday Soon” playing on the radio.
11,4,SAM,What are you listening to?
11,4,JOHN,Your mom used to love this song.
11,4,SAM,Dad?
11,4,JOHN,"You okay, pal?  You look a little spooked.  It's nice to be back behind the wheel.  Looks like Dean's taken good care of this old beast.  Seems like he's taken good care of you, too."
11,4,SAM,What is this? Another vision?
11,4,JOHN,"Are you having visions, son?"
11,4,SAM,Don't call me that.
11,4,JOHN,What?  A father can't call his --
11,4,SAM,"No, my father is dead."
11,4,JOHN,When has death ever stopped a Winchester?
11,4,SAM,"Look, I don't know what this is, but --"
11,4,JOHN,"What you said about relationships, wanting something more . . . I never wanted this for you boys.  This life. Not really."
11,4,SAM,We turned out okay.
11,4,JOHN,"You did, didn't you?  But that was on you boys.  You did that, not me."
11,4,SAM,"Well, you played your part."
11,4,JOHN,"I did my best, anyway, for what it was worth."
11,4,SAM,This isn't real.
11,4,JOHN,"I never could fool you, could I?"
11,4,SAM,"I prayed when I was in that church, and I saw . . . Something.  And now, here you are, whoever you are, whatever you are.  What the hell is this?"
11,4,JOHN,Dream. Vision.  Call it what you want.  The message is still the same.  The Darkness is coming . . . And only you boys can stop it.
11,4,SAM,"Okay, fine.  How?  We need help, not visions of dead people."
11,4,JOHN,God helps those who help themselves.
11,4,SAM,Who are you?
11,4,Int. Impala,Sam wakes from his dream to find Dean has pulled over and is parked.
11,4,DEAN,"Welcome to the Winchester Motel.  We don't have cable, but we do . . . have room service.  You were singing in your sleep, that song mom loved that dad used to always play for us.  I think I've actually still got the tape."
11,4,SAM,"Hey, Dean, um . . . You said when you saw the Darkness, you weren't sure whether it was, uh . . . the real thing or a vision, right?"
11,4,DEAN,Mm-hmm.
11,4,SAM,"I think I've been having visions, too, lately.  I mean, it's just images.  I mean, more of a . . . feeling, really.  But I just had one right now, and -- and Dad was in it. But it wasn't dad like -- like . . . The Dad that -- that I grew up with.  It was Dad when he was our age.  And I-I guess it wasn't even really Dad.  It was someone pretending to be Dad and --"
11,4,DEAN,"Okay, what makes you say that?"
11,4,SAM,"For starters, he told me everything I wanted to hear."
11,4,DEAN,"Yeah, that doesn't sound like dad."
11,4,SAM,"No. Anyways, whoever it was . . . They had a message to deliver.  They said the Darkness is coming, and . . . only you and I can stop it."
11,4,DEAN,Did they have him give you any helpful tips on how to do that?
11,4,SAM,"He said, ""God helps those who help themselves.""  I mean, maybe these visions are coming from God."
11,4,DEAN,Whoa. Pump the brakes.
11,4,SAM,"I mean, Dean, the first one happened after I prayed."
11,4,DEAN,You prayed? When was this?
11,4,SAM,Back in the hospital.
11,4,DEAN,Why?
11,4,SAM,Because I was infected.  I was infected.  I'm not anymore.  I-I-I never went full rabid. I . . .
11,4,DEAN,You get infected and you didn't even tell me.
11,4,SAM,Dean . . .
11,4,DEAN,What did you pray about?
11,4,SAM,"I guess I was just looking for answers, you know?"
11,4,DEAN,"Well, I'm sure whatever is kicking around in your head right now is a side effect from the infection that you failed to tell me about."
11,4,SAM,"You know, I don't think it's that simple."
11,4,DEAN,"Come on, man. That quote?  ""God helps those who help themselves""?  God didn't say that.  That's not even in the Bible.  That's an old proverb that dates way back to Aesop.  I read.  And more importantly, when was the last time God answered any one of our prayers?  It's not a vision, Sam.  All right?  It's just some . . .Some fever dream.  That's all.  And as far as Dad goes, I dream about Dad all the time."
11,4,SAM,You do?
11,4,DEAN,"Of course I do. It's usually the same one, too.  We're all in the car.  I'm sitting in the driver's seat, dad's sitting shotgun.  But there aren't any shotguns.  There's no monsters.  There's no hunting.  There's none of that.  It's just . . . He's teaching me how to drive.  And, uh, and I'm not little like I was when he actually taught me how to drive.  I'm 16, and he's helping me get my learner's permit.  Of course, you're in the backseat, just begging to take a turn.  We pull up to the house -- the family house -- and I park in the driveway, and he looks over and he says, ""perfect landing, son.""  I have that dream every couple of months.  Kind of comforting, actually."
11,4,SAM,"I always, uh . . . I always dream about mom.  Usually the same kind of thing, though."
11,4,DEAN,Normal life?
11,4,SAM,"Yeah. Normal life.  But, Dean, this wasn't just a dream. I'm telling you."
11,4,DEAN,"Why would somebody dress up like Dad to give you a message?  I mean, Dad.  You don't exactly have a history of listening to what he had to say."
11,4,SAM,But you said the Darkness is -- is sending messages to you.  Maybe whatever is the opposite of the Darkness is sending messages to me.
11,4,DEAN,"And you think that this thing is God?  Come on.  How many -- how many opportunities has God had to crack this pinata, and I don't see any candy on the floor, do you?"
11,4,SAM,"Okay, then maybe it's not God. But uh . . ."
11,4,DEAN,"I know what you're trying to do here.  You're trying to find some -- some greater meaning to it all.  Right? Some . . . Fate to what went down.  But I'm telling you, Sam.  The Darkness?  It's on us.  And no one's gonna help us, certainly not God, so we'll have to figure this thing out, like we always do.  But until then . . . We hunt. This case for starters, course this case is . . ."
11,4,SAM,It's just probably nothing.
11,4,DEAN,"Yeah, probably nothing."
11,4,SAM,"Goodnight, jerk."
11,4,DEAN,"Night, bitch."
11,4,Int. Impala,The boys drive to the police station.  Dean waits in the car for Sam.
11,4,SAM,Hey.
11,4,DEAN,"The coroner showed me the sheriff's body.  And, uh, it was mauled all right.  And get this -- heart missing, body completely drained of blood."
11,4,SAM,"So, what? We're looking at a-a werewolf/vampire hybrid?"
11,4,DEAN,Say it with me -- a were-pyre. Huh?
11,4,SAM,No.
11,4,DEAN,Come on.
11,4,SAM,I'm not saying that.
11,4,DEAN,"Whatever. I called Cas, told him to look into the lore.  What do you got?"
11,4,SAM,"Right, well, uh, the sheriff's replacement -- Deputy Donnelly -- he's not the brightest bulb, but I got a copy of his report.  Maybe he missed something."
11,4,DONELLY,Agents.
11,4,DEAN,Deputy.
11,4,DONELLY,"This must be your partner.  Agent Walsh, right?  Pleasure to meet you.  I just want to thank you both for stoppin' by.  We really appreciate your due diligence."
11,4,DEAN,"Oh. Actually, uh, do you know a motel where we can crash for the night?"
11,4,DONELLY,You're stayin'?
11,4,SAM,"Yeah, just wanna kick all the tires."
11,4,DONELLY,"Well, uh, there's a motel on Downey that'll give you a good price.  And if you're looking for a decent meal, you can't beat Aunt Mel's, down by the train station.  Parking is a bitch, but it's the best damn steak in the whole state."
11,4,DEAN,"You had me at ""steak."""
11,4,Int. Impala,Sam and Dean pull up to the steakhouse and are forced to use the valet parking.
11,4,DEAN,"Ohh, all right.  Now we're cookin' with gas.  Valet?  You -- what?"
11,4,SAM,"Dean, people valet park all the time.  Come on, live a little."
11,4,JESSIE,"Welcome to Aunt Mel's, home of the --"
11,4,DEAN,"Yeah, listen, uh, Jessie, not a scratch, okay?"
11,4,JESSIE,"Spider caught a fly.  I repeat, spider caught a fly."
11,4,Int. Impala,Jessie picks up a friend and they do a little joyriding in Baby.
11,4,JESSIE,Let's go! Come on!
11,4,JESSIE’S FRIEND,"Okay!  Hell, yeah. Let's roll!"
11,4,JESSIE,Let's get this party started.
11,4,BOTH,Whoo!
11,4,JESSIE,"Whoo! Whoo! Oh, my God!"
11,4,JESSIE,"Oh, my God!"
11,4,JESSIE,"(answering the phone) Yes, sir?  We're on our way.  My way."
11,4,JESSIE’S FRIEND,What did you do?
11,4,JESSIE,I'm gonna get fired.
11,4,JESSIE,Come on!
11,4,JESSIE’S FRIEND,Okay!
11,4,JESSIE,I gotta go. Let's go!
11,4,JESSIE’S FRIEND,Where's my purse?
11,4,JESSIE,You probably just left it in your car.
11,4,JESSIE’S FRIEND,What?
11,4,JESSIE,I gotta go! I don't wanna get fired!
11,4,JESSIE’S FRIEND,Ugh!
11,4,Int. Impala,Jessie drives back to the steakhouse where Dean and Sam are waiting.  Dean and Sam then drive away from the restaurant.
11,4,DEAN,"Strong work, Jessie.  Strong work."
11,4,JESSIE,Thanks.
11,4,DEAN,So what's next?
11,4,SAM,"I want to, uh, talk to sheriff's widow.  Lily Markham.  Maybe she knows something about why her husband was out in the woods in the first place."
11,4,DEAN,"All right, well, I'll drop you off.  I wanna go back to the woods where they found the body.  Something wasn't right about those crime scene photos."
11,4,Int. Impala,Dean is looking at the crime scene when Castiel calls him with some information on the lore.  The sheriff shows up and attacks Dean.
11,4,DEAN,"Cas, you okay?"
11,4,CASTIEL,I'm mostly confused.  I'm not sure how orange correlates with black in a way that's new.
11,4,DEAN,Step away from the Netflix.
11,4,CAS,Sorry.
11,4,DEAN,It's okay. We've all had a binge.  You find anything in the lore?
11,4,CASTIEL,"Well, there is a creature that feeds on hearts and blood."
11,4,DEAN,"A were-pyre, you might say?  Come on, I know you wanna say it."
11,4,CASTIEL,"In the lore, it's referred to a ‘Whisper’."
11,4,DEAN,That's lame.
11,4,CASTIEL,"Silver will kill it, but you may want to decapitate it just to be sure."
11,4,DEAN,"All right, sounds good.  I'm at the crime scene now. It was staged.  The body was dragged.  There were no signs of struggle."
11,4,CASTIEL,Body was moved there to look more like an animal attack?
11,4,DEAN,"Yeah, maybe. It was pretty sloppy, though.  You, uh . . . What else you got on these things?"
11,4,CASTIEL,Listen to this. Whispers have a fascinating history.
11,4,DEAN,Hang on.
11,4,CASTIEL,"They're -- they're . . . Actually, they were once believed to be in the bloodline of werewolves, but in fact, they are more similar to demons."
11,4,DEAN,Deputy.
11,4,DONELLY,"What's going on, Agent?"
11,4,CASTEL,"They, uh, they got their nickname from how quiet their attacks are.  Because of their stealthiness, they've, uh, lived on the fringes for centuries. Although there were several that were hunted and killed during the Salem witch . . . Wait a minute.  Okay, according to this, Whispers only feed during the solar eclipse.  Uh, so, Dean, I-i don't believe what you're hunting is a Whisper."
11,4,DEAN,Aah!
11,4,CASTIEL,"Must be another creature of some kind.  Okay. Fine, I'll say it.  Maybe it is your so-called ""Were-pyre.""  But to be honest, I have never heard . . . Of a creature with that name.  Dean, what is that?"
11,4,DEAN,Aah!
11,4,CASTIEL,"Dean? Dean, are you all right?  I hear gunshots.  Dean!  Dean?  Dean!"
11,4,DEAN,"Ah, it turns out I did shoot the deputy."
11,4,CASTIEL,"Wait, Dean, is -- is everything --"
11,4,DEAN,The deputy was a Were-pyre.  It's all right.  Silver bullets worked.
11,4,CASTIEL,"No, Dean, listen . . . According to the lore, the timing is off.  The next solar eclipse in North America is years away. It can't be a --"
11,4,DEAN,Hang on.
11,4,CASTIEL,"Dean, wait.  Listen, it couldn't be . . . Dean?"
11,4,DEAN,Scratch that. You gotta cut off their . . .
11,4,DONNELY,(Growls)
11,4,CASTIEL,"Dean, it's not a Whisper."
11,4,DEAN,"Yeah, I'm starting to get that.  Give me a second.  All right. Th-- All right, that . . . Okay.  Smile, asshat.  All right, Cas, you there?"
11,4,CASTIEL,Of course. What's going on?
11,4,DEAN,"Well, whatever it is, silver slows it down.  I, uh, I'm sending you a picture right now . . . Of its fangs.  I-I've never seen anything like it.  See if there's a match in the lore, would ya?"
11,4,CASTIEL,I'm on it.
11,4,SAM,"Dean, I got jumped."
11,4,DEAN,You okay?
11,4,SAM,"I think . . . For now.  Pretty sure we're dealing with a pack here.  Uh, two of these things were attacking Mrs. Markham when I arrived.  I-I filled them with silver, but it only slowed them down."
11,4,DEAN,"Yeah, well, Deputy Dumbass is one of them as well.  He's, uh, he's in two pieces and still alive.  Where you at now?"
11,4,SAM,"Mrs. Markham was knocked out.  I-I-I carried her to the house nearby.  Here, I'll text you the address now."
11,4,DEAN,"All right, sit tight.  I'm on my way.  Everybody's gettin' jumped."
11,4,Int. Impala,Sam and Dean drive with the unconscious Mrs. Markham in the back seat.
11,4,SAM,"Door was open when I got to the house.  By the time I searched through it, they'd already beaten her unconscious."
11,4,DEAN,Maybe she knew something or something about what happened to her husband.
11,4,SAM,"So what, they tried to take her out while the deputy went back to the scene?"
11,4,DEAN,"Yeah, he went to fix it up.  Found me."
11,4,DEAN,"Hey, Cas, tell me you got something that doesn't involve chicks in prison."
11,4,SAM,Bet you never thought you'd say that out loud.
11,4,CASTIEL,It's a Nachzehrer.
11,4,SAM,Come again?
11,4,CASTIEL,A ghoul and vampire-like creature.
11,4,DEAN,A Ghoul-pyre! Right?
11,4,CASTIEL,"Some breeds feed on the flesh of the dead.  Others feed on the blood and hearts of the living.  They run in small packs, but they usually keep an extremely low profile."
11,4,DEAN,Great.  So how do we kill 'em?
11,4,CASTIEL,"Well, they're already dead.  So in a manner of speaking, they just need to be reminded that they're dead.  You need a Charon's obol."
11,4,SAM,"Of course.  Yeah, in ancient Greece, uh, when a person died, some people believed you had to put an obol, or a-a coin, in their mouth so they can use it as currency to be taken across the river to the underworld."
11,4,CASTIEL,"Right, you place a coin in a Nachzehrer's mouth, then sever their head, and that will kill them.  And according to the lore, if you kill the pack's Alpha, everyone they've turned will revert back to human form."
11,4,DEAN,"Awesome. All right, where do we find an obol?"
11,4,CASTIEL,"Well, according to the Men of Letters' records, you're gonna need a copper coin.  They used to use pennies, so you'll need one of those."
11,4,SAM,"Yeah, but one minted pre-1982.  So before 1982, pennies were 95% copper.  Since then, they're only copper-plated zinc."
11,4,DEAN,Wow. Your nerdiness knows no bounds.
11,4,SAM,You're welcome.
11,4,DEAN,"All right, well, thanks Cas.  Good work. Way to come off the bench."
11,4,CASTIEL,What bench?
11,4,SAM,"Just get back to getting better, okay?  Got nothing."
11,4,DEAN,"Well, yeah, I mean, who carries pennies these days anyway?"
11,4,SAM,I'll be right back.
11,4,DEAN,Yeah.  (Mrs. Markham wakes up in the backseat) Mrs. Markham?  Mrs. Markham.  It's okay.  I'm Dean Winchester.  My -- my brother Sam and --
11,4,MRS. MARKHAM,Where am I?
11,4,DEAN,You were attacked by the same people that killed your husband.
11,4,MRS. MARKHAM,My husband.
11,4,DEAN,"Now do you know something about what happened to him?  Maybe that's why these people attacked you?  Okay. Well, we're gonna take you someplace safe, all right?  And then we're gonna kill these sons of bitches.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I could -- uh, I could explain that.  Well, maybe not.  Uh, it's like the thing that attacked you, okay?  It's -- it's a Ghoul-pyre.  The point is, it can't hurt you anymore.  At least, I don't think it . . . Let's . . . You know what?  Let's just get rid of it.  Here we go.  Okay, all right.  See? There we go.  You okay?"
11,4,MRS. MARKHAM,"Your family.  You do anything for them, don't you?"
11,4,DEAN,"Absolutely.  Yeah, but not if it costs too much. [ Chuckles ]"
11,4,MRS. MARKHAM,No. You do everything for them.  Everything else is meaningless.  But I did it wrong.  Now I've ruined everything.
11,4,DEAN,This isn't your fault.
11,4,MRS. MARKHAM,I put my family at risk.  They were right to attack me.  But I know how to make it right.
11,4,DEAN,Uhh!
11,4,MRS. MARKHAM,Where is it?!  What did you do with the maker's body?!  You're gonna tell me or I will end you!
11,4,DEAN,Uhh!
11,4,Int. Impala,Mrs. Markham knocks Dean unconscious and drives away with him in the Impala.  They park at the crime scene where Dean’s left the deputy’s body.
11,4,MRS. MARKHAM,See?  That wasn't so hard.  Now I know what to do with you.  I can make this right; I can make this right; I can make this right; I can make this right; okay. See? I fixed it.  You're okay.
11,4,Int. Impala,Deputy Donelly and Mrs. Markham drive with Dean in the back seat.  He wakes up and has a conversation with the Deputy.
11,4,DONELLY,I know you're awake.  I know you're a hunter.
11,4,DEAN,"And I know you're a Nachzehrer.  The maker, right?  The pack Alpha?"
11,4,DONELLY,"Well, maybe you're not as dumb as you look."
11,4,DEAN,Thought you and yours like to keep a low profile.
11,4,DONELLY,"Sadly, rookies like Lily here aren't up to snuff when it comes to keeping"
11,4,DEAN,So you killed your husband?
11,4,MRS. MARKHAM,"He wouldn't join us.  People who don't join are food.  But I messed up, and I . . .  I didn't bury him right."
11,4,DONELLY,"It's my fault, really.  You weren't properly trained.  But everyone deserves a mulligan, don't they?  That's all my people were trying to do, Lily.  They weren't going to kill you.  Hell, I need you.  I need all the help I can get."
11,4,DEAN,Have many have you turned?
11,4,DONELLY,In the first hundred years?  Three.  In the last month? 16.
11,4,DEAN,"What, are you trying to field a baseball team?"
11,4,DONELLY,"It's like I said, I need help, every strong hand I can find.  And I need an army to fight the Darkness.  Oh, it's comin', for all of us.  There's nothing hunters or any human can do about it."
11,4,DEAN,Do you know how to stop it?
11,4,DONELLY,"I don't think anything can stop it. I'm just tryin' to buy some time, so I'm turning as many strong men and women as I can. Your brother will make a fine addition to the rank and file.  While you slept, I send him a text message from your phone.  Oh, he's heading into a trap right now.  You'd make a good soldier, too, but you cut off my head, and I can't stand for that.  Don't worry.  I'm an every part of the buffalo kind of guy.  Your death won't go to waste.  You'll be your brother's first meal."
11,4,Int. Impala,"After Dean crashes the Impala, he fights with Mrs. Markham and the Deputy."
11,4,DEAN,"Oh, baby, I'm so sorry."
11,4,MRS. MARKHAM,"Oh, my God. What have I . . . My kids.  My kids.  They turned my kids.  They're with the others.  Please."
11,4,DEAN,"Sam.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on. Come on.  Come on. Come on.  Come on, baby.  Yeah! There we go.  Ahh.  Hang on."
11,4,Int. Impala,Dean and Mrs. Markham pull up to where Sam and the others were being held.
11,4,DEAN,"Probably nothing, right?  Everybody all right back there?"
11,4,SAM,"Uh, yeah.  They all changed back.  So it was deputy dumbass, huh?"
11,4,DEAN,"Mm. Yeah, deputy dumbass.  You know, he was trying to build an army."
11,4,SAM,"Yeah, I know, to fight the Darkness.  Dean, even the monsters are scared."
11,4,DEAN,"Well, let 'em be.  You and I, we're gonna end this thing now."
11,4,SAM,Would you mind starting tomorrow?
11,4,DEAN,Deal.
11,4,SAM,Deal.
11,4,DEAN,We'll get Cas to fix you up.
11,4,SAM,"Only if he fixes you up, too."
11,4,DEAN,"Okay, mom.  Let's go home."
11,4,SAM,You know what? We are home.
11,4,DEAN,Come on.  Come on.  Ahh. There's my girl.
11,7,Dean,Uhh!
11,7,Sam,Okay. Yeah.
11,9,Man,Repent your sins. Beg for his divine mercy. When the end comes – and come it will – only the forgiven will ascend to holy grace.
11,9,Man,He’s watching. He’s waiting.
11,9,Amara,This is God you’re speaking of? Do you really think he’s watching?
11,9,Man,Deciding which of us is worthy. Only the chosen will be raised to heaven.
11,9,Amara,"Oh, and that’s you? Truthfully, I don’t think he’s all that interested. He doesn’t even seem to be around. Believe me, I’ve searched."
11,9,Man,"Stop right there, sister. Beg for his forgiveness or face his terrible wrath."
11,9,Amara,"Really? Gets annoyed, does he?"
11,9,Man,His wrath comes in many forms but only God is able to create the fiercesome plague and destruction and all on earth will bow before.
11,9,Amara,You mean something like this?
11,9,Amara (laughing),"God, you mean? No. But let’s just say he not the only game in town."
11,9,Amara,"Oh, honey, you wish. [Amara gazes skyward]. Well?"
11,9,Sam,Is this really the answer? Is this what you want?
11,9,Dean,"Because it’s crazy, okay! And it’s not going to happen. How many times do I have to say that this is a horrible idea?"
11,9,Sam,"About as many as I have to say, okay then what else have we got? Listen, I’m all ears. Dean, ordinarily I’d agree with you, but the visions only happen when I reach out to God. I asked him for a way to beat the Darkness and the visions got more specific – and I was in the Cage."
11,9,Dean,"Yeah, with Lucifer. The biggest monster ever hatched. Fan-freaking-tastic!"
11,9,Sam,"You know Lucifer was the biggest monster ever hatched, until you and I hatched one that’s even worse. Listen, in the vision, Lucifer touches me and I feel calm, like things will be all right. And that’s not something I would ever come up with. I mean that is the last thing that I would ever feel."
11,9,Dean,"If Lucifer touched you, it would be the last thing you think. Ever."
11,9,Sam,There was a burning bush.
11,9,Dean,A burning bush?
11,9,Sam,Like in the Bible.
11,9,Dean,You were in the forest. There are bushes there and sometimes they burn!
11,9,Sam,"Dean, doesn’t it make sense? I mean, Lucifer would know how God ended the Darkness. He was there."
11,9,Dean,We’re not saying it’s going to happen. We just want to know...
11,9,Sam,theoretically...
11,9,Dean,if it’s possible.
11,9,Crowley,The Cage is a can of worms you do not want to open. I believe this conversation is over... [Crowley prepares to snap his fingers].
11,9,Dean,"Is it? Crowley, you know that the Darkness is going to pound on everything and that includes you."
11,9,Sam,"Yeah. And you had a shot at taking her out when she was with you, but apparently you thought that sucking up was the way to go."
11,9,Dean,And that didn’t work out so well.
11,9,Crowley,What is she to you?
11,9,Dean,Wanna know what she is Crowley? How about God’s sister!
11,9,Crowley,God’s sister? He has relatives? I had that kind of leverage under my thumb and I let it slip away.
11,9,Dean,Can we focus on the big picture here okay? Can Sam meet with Lucifer or not?
11,9,Sam,In the Cage.
11,9,Dean,"No, not in the Cage. That’s not going to happen."
11,9,Sam,"Okay, then I don’t meet with Lucifer. Dean, we can’t let him out."
11,9,Crowley,There may be a way.
11,9,Crowley,"Clearly, if Sam enters the Cage he’s gone. And yes, it’s on my bucket list, now is not the time to be selfish. Need a secure site, a way to neutralize Lucifer’s powers."
11,9,Sam,In Hell?
11,9,Crowley,"Yes, in Hell! So we have a modicum of control. You think I want that abomination running amuck upstairs?"
11,9,Dean,Is it possible to control the situation because if Sam’s not safe it’s not happening.
11,9,Crowley,"Goodness mummy, loosen the grip. Theoretically it’s possible, with challenges. I can arrange for transit into Hell. Opening the Cage, that’s another matter."
11,9,Dean,You’re the King of the joint. Don’t you have a key?
11,9,Crowley,"It was sealed by God Himself. Of course I don’t have a key. The mechanisms of divine manufacturer, I believe its secrets, along with the spells for warding Sam were recorded where many such mysteries are found – the Book of the Damned."
11,9,Priest,Good to see you again.
11,9,Priest,"Hello Mary, how are you?"
11,9,Priest,"Agnes, what a pleasure. Good to see you."
11,9,Amara,Are you in charge here? I’m looking for God.
11,9,Priest,"Oh, of course. We all look for God in all things."
11,9,Amara,No. I need an actual meeting in a room.
11,9,Priest,"Well, it’s the right place. This is his house. And the way to reach him is through prayer."
11,9,Priest,Mm. Go ahead. Take her out for a spin.
11,9,Priest,Well of course it’s working. He heard you.
11,9,Amara,How do you know?
11,9,Priest,Because he promised.
11,9,Amara,"Oh, so you have seen him then."
11,9,Priest,"Well, no one has. At least no one alive."
11,9,Amara,"Wait. So only dead people get to see him? [The Priest nods]. And this makes sense, to billions of you?"
11,9,Priest,"It is the nature of faith. It’s all here [he picks up a Bible]. The mercy of God, his love of the world and mankind, his perfect plan for us..."
11,9,Amara,A manipulation. You only believe what he wants you to believe.
11,9,Priest,Exactly.
11,9,Amara,You don’t know what he’s like at all.
11,9,Priest,"We certainly do. God is the Light, and it is the Light that vanquishes the Darkness."
11,9,Crowley,Mother. Good of you to stop by.
11,9,Crowley,"Stow it, you lying bitch. If you could do that, you’d have done it. If I wanted to kill you, I’d have done that."
11,9,Rowena,Not that you haven’t tried.
11,9,Crowley,You tried to kill me twice.
11,9,Rowena,What is it they say? Third time’s the charm.
11,9,Rowena,"Oh, you’re not handing me over to them. It’s beneath even you. They’re your enemies as well."
11,9,Dean,"All right Rowena. We get it. We all enemies, okay. But right now we’ve got bigger fish to fry. Then we can go back to killing each other."
11,9,Rowena,"Ah, the chicken’s come home to roost. This ghastly force set free when the Mark was removed."
11,9,Sam,So you know?
11,9,Rowena,I’ve heard whispers. As bad as they say?
11,9,Dean,"Well, let’s just say that everyone in this room might hold a piece of the puzzle to corking it back up."
11,9,Rowena,"Oh, really, and what happens to me once the danger is past? How do I know that I can trust any of you?"
11,9,Crowley,You don’t. None of us do. It’s a Devil’s bargain.
11,9,Angel 1,"This is a time for all angels to pull together, put aside our disagreements and show the big bosses how to save Heaven from being taken over; cos it’s grunts like us who’ll get kicked aside. Believe me. The Darkness has a plan for every one of God’s creations."
11,9,Angel 3,"Yeah, who made her God?"
11,9,Angel 1,Come on Daniel. You know the stories as well as I do. All powerful. All consuming.
11,9,Angel 1,"Yeah. You tell him that. Next time you see him. Oh, oops! He’s not around. Yeah. He locked her up and you don’t think she’s going to want to get even by tearing apart anything he ever made."
11,9,Angel 3,And you’re going to lead us against her? You’ve never led anyone.
11,9,Angel 1,None of us have. How is that a bad thing? When our leaders do nothing but pit the factions against each other.
11,9,Angel 1,This is in our laps guys. So spread the word. We get past our differences. We stand united and we move now!
11,9,Rowena,Can this be true? His sister! In my day we’d all be burned at the stake for even thinking any of this.
11,9,Crowley,"You see then Mother, the need for urgency."
11,9,Rowena,"Well, if my deciphering of the Book is so pivotal, I’d like to know what’s in it for me."
11,9,Dean,"You mean, other than your life?"
11,9,Crowley,"Speaking of which, I’ll make you a little deal Mommy. You pitch in like a good girl; I’ll call off my assassins. No more looking over your shoulder, for now."
11,9,Rowena,"I’ll need the Codex, of course. And the code-breaker Charlie devised."
11,9,Sam,"Yeah, you’ll get limited access. Supervised."
11,9,Dean,We need to know exactly this – how to open the Cage and how to protect Sam once it is.
11,9,Rowena,Just what’s in this cage that’s so dangerous?
11,9,Sam,Lucifer.
11,9,Rowena,Lucifer? The original Dark Prince?
11,9,Dean,"Yes, an arch-angel so bad-assed that he was personally dumped into the Cage by God himself."
11,9,Amara,Do you see what’s happening? All your favourites. All your chosen. They are suffering.
11,9,Sam,"Hey, hey, hey! No snooping around there. Focus."
11,9,Rowena,You talk about trust.
11,9,Sam,No I don’t.
11,9,Rowena,"You and your blood-thirsty brother say we’re partners in this holy war against Amara and yet [Rowena shows Sam her chained hands], trussed like a chicken."
11,9,Sam,"You’re sitting there with the Book of the Damned and the means to read every word, and you think I’m going to set you free? Do I look crazy?"
11,9,Rowena,"Well, you do have unresolved issues with your domineering older brother and the abandonment by your father."
11,9,Sam,You know what? Just get back to work! All right.
11,9,Sam,We’re running out of time here!
11,9,Rowena,"Well, I’ll need some ingredients. But you may summon Fergus. And tell him to bring a hand-cart?"
11,9,Sam,A hand-cart?
11,9,Rowena,We’re going to Hell.
11,9,Dean,"Yeah. Uh, one."
11,9,Rowena,"Sam, everything is in order. Fergus is coming."
11,9,Sam,I promised Dean I’d call.
11,9,Rowena,I promised Lincoln a fun night at the theatre. Things change. It’s now or never.
11,9,Amara,You felt my presence. That’s why you came here.
11,9,Dean,You grew up.
11,9,Amara,Yes.
11,9,Dean,So this is you now?
11,9,Amara,At least for today.
11,9,Rowena,Flop sweat sonny? Dread of what’s to come?
11,9,Crowley,Can it. Your barbs may amuse your circle of hags. You have no idea what you’re tampering with; what Lucifer is capable of.
11,9,Rowena,"Well dear, if you can’t stand the heat, get out of Hell."
11,9,Rowena,I must say it’s not as scenic as I’d expected.
11,9,Crowley,"We are in the furthest reaches of Hell, Limbo, where I send unruly souls for timeout."
11,9,Sam,This is where I meet with Lucifer?
11,9,Crowley,What it lacks in ambience it makes up for in security.
11,9,Crowley,"Makes your flesh crawl, doesn’t it Moose? I get it. I’m the King of this place. It’s still not my cup of tea."
11,9,Sam,"I don’t know, Crowley. I’d say it suits you. Dark. Empty."
11,9,Rowena,"Don’t you worry about me, Samuel. I’m a professional."
11,9,Crowley,Are you certain you can do this without actually opening the Cage?
11,9,Rowena,"We are about to find out, aren’t we."
11,9,Rowena (smiling),"Now, let’s have a go at that Cage."
11,9,Crowley,It begins.
11,9,Amara,You misunderstand my purpose on earth.
11,9,Dean,"Well, do I misunderstand the people that you butchered in the park or that church?"
11,9,Amara,I had to get his attention.
11,9,Dean,His?
11,9,Amara,"God. I tried praying, calling out in need. He ignored me. He forced my hand. I had no other reason to harm his chosen. My issue is with my brother, not his creation."
11,9,Dean,"Whatever the deal is between you two; whoever threw the first punch, whoever was Daddy’s favorite..."
11,9,Dean,Whatever. That mess is your mess. It’s between you two. You’re taking people’s lives. You’re taking their souls.
11,9,Lucifer,"My old friend, Crowley."
11,9,Crowley,"A mere acolyte, carrying your torch."
11,9,Lucifer,You’re too kind... to yourself.
11,9,Lucifer,What do you want of me?
11,9,Lucifer,(Whispers) Sam Winchester. My old roomie. Hug it out?
11,9,Lucifer,"I gotta say, I’m a little in the dark about this meeting. Am I up for parole? Time off for bad behavior?"
11,9,Lucifer,I don’t really get visitors.
11,9,Sam,"If it weren’t for the crisis top-side, you wouldn’t be getting one now."
11,9,Lucifer,Crisis?
11,9,Rowena,(Starts drooling) He’s so alpha isn’t he? Probably not relationship material though.
11,9,Crowley,"Mother, you’re drooling. Get a hold of yourself."
11,9,Sam,She’s been released. So now she’s somewhere or everywhere on earth.
11,9,Lucifer,How ever did that happen?
11,9,Lucifer,"Hmm. Oh, that leads me to my next question. Where’s the big burrito himself? Where’s God in all of this? [Lucifer makes the religious sign]."
11,9,Sam,All current indications of his presence are that there are no current indications of his presence.
11,9,Lucifer,What? Caught the fun bus out of town? Figures.
11,9,Sam,"But, recently, he has reached out to an interested party."
11,9,Lucifer,Who?
11,9,Sam,Me.
11,9,Sam,He answered my prayers.
11,9,Lucifer,"Did he now? And, what was Dad’s suggestion?"
11,9,Sam,To seek out you.
11,9,Lucifer (laughs),Get outta town! Seriously? Who’d have thunk it?
11,9,Amara,"I see the wariness in your eyes, the mistrust. I don’t blame you."
11,9,Dean,Don’t you?
11,9,Amara,"It’s incredible. How it endures, the propaganda. He was so threatened by me, fearful that I would make a more perfect creation than he. So, he exiled me. Virtually erased me. Passed on stories that I was a threat."
11,9,Dean,"While your brother was going all Kanye, blowing his horn."
11,9,Amara,"He encouraged religions as monuments to his ego, promised the fearful safety if they’d adore him. His way or the highway."
11,9,Dean,"Some people find comfort in that. Golden rule, Brother’s keeper. It is his universe. His rules."
11,9,Crowley,Can you hear what they’re saying?
11,9,Rowena,I could if you’d just shut it!
11,9,Lucifer,"I completely get why you came to me. You can’t ignore God, right? God says jump, everybody says “how high”?"
11,9,Sam,"So, does this mean you are on board?"
11,9,Lucifer,"Well, I did help Dad seal up the Darkness all those years ago. She’s quite a force. Determined to take over everything, even back then. Prone to tantrums. I can see why Pop is laying low."
11,9,Crowley,A lot of blabber going on. Surely Sam knows better than to cut some sort of deal.
11,9,Rowena,"You know Fergus, sometimes striking a deal, even a painful one, may be the only option."
11,9,Crowley,"Like the hit you took out on me, for instance?"
11,9,Rowena,"It’s not easy being a parent; knowing when to hug your child, when to kill him."
11,9,Lucifer,"Now that sis is here, God’s not the only circus in town."
11,9,Sam,Is she equal to him in power?
11,9,Lucifer,Raw power? Sure. But she’s got none of the experience. God is a master strategist. That’s why you’re here.
11,9,Sam,And why is that?
11,9,Lucifer,"Oh, because God needs me to help put the cat back in the bag. [Laughing] He can’t do it by himself. Seen that movie."
11,9,Sam,And?
11,9,Lucifer,"And, I need a ride out of here. I mean, I look swell in here and everything, but I’d be so much smoke top-side."
11,9,Sam,You want a vessel.
11,9,Lucifer,"One who is strong enough to hold me, handy, and available now. [Sam and Lucifer exchange knowing looks]. Catch my drift?"
11,9,Dean,"What is it exactly that you want? When you make the world of bliss and peace, what’s in it for you?"
11,9,Amara,What I deserve.
11,9,Dean,Which is?
11,9,Amara,Everything.
11,9,Dean,Everything?
11,9,Amara,I was the beginning and I will be the end. I will be all that there is.
11,9,Dean,"So, you’re it. [Dean turns away from Amara]. That would make you God."
11,9,Amara,"No, God was the Light. I’m the Dark."
11,9,Dean,Then what?
11,9,Amara,That’s all you need to know for now.
11,9,Amara,You had to know that was pointless. I know that you’re a warrior and your instinct is to resist. But I can’t be resisted.
11,9,Sam,Did you really expect me to agree to this?
11,9,Sam [angry],"So, what, I just disappear while you take my body and get set loose on the world again?"
11,9,Sam [yelling],That’s not desperate! That’s certifiable!
11,9,Lucifer,"Sam, why do you think God sent you to me? To get my help, which I only now just offered. Sam, your visions were the Word of God. You can’t say no to that."
11,9,Dean,What was that?
11,9,Amara,The future. The inevitable result of our first meeting. What you’ve been feeling since that moment. What we both felt. That we’re bonded. You’re the one who set me free.
11,9,Dean,No. That was an accident.
11,9,Amara,(Chuckles) It was destiny. You bore the Mark. I am the original Mark. (Shows Dean her mark.) You and I will be together.
11,9,Dean,"No. No, that’s not going to happen."
11,9,Amara,It’s so simple Dean. We will become one. Why wouldn’t you want that?
11,9,Angel 1,Amara! You’re going to surrender to us and to the judgement of Heaven.
11,9,Amara,Why ever would I submit to anything of God’s creation? Tell your master to come fetch me himself.
11,9,Angel 1,Not even you could survive it.
11,9,Dean,"Whoa, whoa, fellows, dial it down a bit, okay. Look, if you take her down, a whole bunch of people are going to die."
11,9,Angel 1,We’re at the point where sacrifice is inevitable.
11,9,Dean,"Amara, No!"
11,9,Amara,"Maybe now, he’ll hear me."
11,9,Lucifer,"So, have you thought about it, Sam? Do I have an invitation to look forward to?"
11,9,Sam,No. I won’t do it. There has to be another way.
11,9,Crowley,What the hell is going on?
11,9,Crowley [panicking],Why did the warding fail? What’s happening?
11,9,Rowena [calmly],Follow me Fergus.
11,9,Lucifer,"Hey, Sam Winchester. Did you miss me? I bet you did."
11,9,Lucifer,"I have to say, you’re extraordinarily calm given the circumstances."
11,9,Sam,"Well, it’s pretty much exactly how God told me it was going to be. Guess I just have to go with it and play my hand."
11,9,Lucifer,(Chuckles) So I...I guess I am your only hope.
11,9,Sam,It’s never going to happen.
11,9,Lucifer,"Ah, well, settle in there buddy [smiling]. Hey, roomie... Upper bunk? Lower bunk? Or you wanna share?"
11,10,Crowley [excitedly],"Boy, oh boy."
11,10,Crowley [excitedly],"Mum! Mum, I got a Sam."
11,10,Rowena [unenthusiastically],"Good for you, dearie."
11,10,Crowley [excitedly],Santa!
11,10,Santa,"Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho..."
11,10,Crowley [excitedly],Watchya bring me? Watchya bring me?
11,10,Santa,"Oh, let’s see what Santa got for you today."
11,10,Santa,"Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho..."
11,10,Santa,Really Rowena? This is what you dream about?
11,10,Rowena,More of a recurring nightmare actually. [She points to the reindeer ears] These don’t come off. I’ve been having this dream for months. But you... you’re new. Who are you?
11,10,Santa,"Yeah, sorry my manners are a bit rusty."
11,10,Sam,You? The visions... everything... it was all you?
11,10,Lucifer,"Impressive, right?"
11,10,Sam,And Rowena?
11,10,Lucifer,Did as she was told. Groupies... they’re always so eager.
11,10,Sam,So you did all of that just to... to what... jump my bones?
11,10,Lucifer,Literally.
11,10,Sam,"Well, you wasted your time then. You see I know how this ends."
11,10,Lucifer,"Oh, do you now?"
11,10,Sam,"Yeah. You’ll taunt me and you’ll, ah, torture me, and I’ll say no. And eventually, sooner than you think, my brother’s gonna walk through that door and kick your ass."
11,10,Lucifer [laughing],Dean? You’re betting on Dean?
11,10,Sam,I always have.
11,10,Lucifer,Oh Sam. You got me all wrong.
11,10,Sam,"Ha, I doubt that."
11,10,Lucifer,No. No. I’m not here to torture ya. I mean I could.
11,10,Lucifer,I could inflict pain like you can’t even imagine. I could inflict such delicious perfect pain.
11,10,Lucifer,But that was so five years ago. No. I’m not going to harm a glorious little hair on that glorious little head.
11,10,Sam,Then what do you want?
11,10,Lucifer,"To make an offer you can’t refuse. You see Sam, you need me and I’m gonna prove it to you."
11,10,Lucifer,Recognise it?
11,10,Sam,What?
11,10,Lucifer,"We’re in a memory Sam, one of the few good ones from your childhood. By the way, I thought I had Daddy issues, but you, wow! Anyway, I think you recognise the dashing young bean-pole over there."
11,10,Sam,That’s me.
11,10,Crowley,You’re dead!
11,10,Rowena,"Please Fergus, enough with idle threats."
11,10,Crowley,"You betrayed me, in my kingdom."
11,10,Rowena [gasping],Not yours! His! Hell is his! I’m his. So hurt me and what do you think he’ll do to you?
11,10,Crowley,Lucifer will never get out of that cell.
11,10,Crowley,How long? How long have you been working for him?
11,10,Rowena,"Not long, Lucifer came to me in a dream... [Crowley turns to look at Rowena and she smirks]... Not that kind of dream."
11,10,Crowley,So you're just gonna let the big strong man boss you around? Whatever happened to the super-duper awesome coven #girlpower?
11,10,Rowena,Lucifer is no man. He’s perfection. Why do you think I let your droogs find me? Lucifer has a plan and...
11,10,Crowley,"And, he’s the devil."
11,10,Rowena,You say that like it’s a bad thing.
11,10,Crowley,"Oh, I’m a bad thing. He’s a worse thing. Last time Lucifer went topside you know what he wanted? [Rowena smiles at the question]. Death. For you. For me. And every human. And every demon."
11,10,Rowena,He’s changed.
11,10,Crowley,"Oh yes, of course. All he needed was the love of a horrible woman. So... and you’re doing all this... why? Out of the goodness of your heart?"
11,10,Rowena,"Don’t you be daft. After Lucifer stops the Darkness, he’ll ascend to his throne... in Heaven and I’ll be by his side, a loyal follower."
11,10,Crowley,A queen?
11,10,Rowena,"Like it or not, you know I’m right. Lucifer fought the Darkness before and he won. [Rowena stands up and glares at Crowley, angry]. So... unless you’ve got the almighty in your back pocket, I suggest you sit down, shut up and let him work."
11,10,EXTERIOR,Dean drives the impala down a road. He tries to call Sam.
11,10,Dean,Call me! Now!
11,10,Castiel,Dean?
11,10,Castiel,I came as soon as you called. Are you alright?
11,10,Cas,You’re not alright.
11,10,Dean,What are you doing?
11,10,Cas,Stick out your tongue.
11,10,Dean,What?
11,10,Dean,"Alright, are we done?"
11,10,Cas,No. [Cas looks worried and holds up his finger]. Let me take your temperature.
11,10,Cas,How far are we from the event?
11,10,Dean,You mean the angel nuke?
11,10,Cas,Yeah.
11,10,Dean,Ground zero is about a mile down that way.
11,10,Cas,That explains it. You’re suffering from smiting sickness.
11,10,Cas,"Yeah. The angels... what they did... it released a tremendous amount of energy and there’s fallout, so this whole area is poisoned."
11,10,Dean,You can heal me right?
11,10,Cas,"No, I can’t and the closer you get to the blast site the worse your sickness will become."
11,10,Dean,How worse?
11,10,Cas,"The last time there was a smiting of this magnitude, Lot’s wife turned to salt."
11,10,Cas,"Alright Dean, you need to go back."
11,10,Dean,"Ah, no. [He struggles to stand up]. No. No, we gotta... we gotta go see if it worked... see if Amara is alive or dead."
11,10,Cas,We don’t. The fallout doesn’t affect angels. I’ll go in alone.
11,10,Dean,"Okay, ya, it’s probably better that way. I’ll take a drive and go check on Sam."
11,10,Cas,Right. Good.
11,10,Dean,"Hey Cas? If it did work and she is dead, bring her body out."
11,10,Cas,And if she’s not?
11,10,Dean,Run.
11,10,Young Sam,"So, the Aztec priests... they thought if they didn’t sacrifice people the whole world would end. So they built all of these temples. The most amazing ones are in Mexico City."
11,10,Young Sam,"Last year, my Dad took me and my brother on a trip to Mexico."
11,10,Young girl,On vacation?
11,10,Young Sam,Kind of a working vacation.
11,10,Young Sam,Have you ever heard of a chupacabra?
11,10,Lucifer,"Look at that, Sam; the simple girl from the one-stoplight town. And you... the worldly, handsome-ish... Sam Winchester. She didn’t stand a chance. You remember?"
11,10,Sam,"Yeah, why are you..."
11,10,Lucifer,Shhh... this is the best part.
11,10,Young girl,"Sam, you know I didn’t bring you here to study, right?"
11,10,Young Sam,You didn’t?
11,10,Young girl,No.
11,10,Young girl,"I mean, I just think that you’re smart and funny... and cute... so, I mean... if you want to make out?"
11,10,Lucifer,"Boom! That’s it. That’s what I’m talking about right there, man."
11,10,Sam [annoyed],Kissing?
11,10,Lucifer,"No, Sam. This is the Sam Winchester that I remember. Bold. Decisive. Solid B on the tongue action."
11,10,Sam,What is this about?
11,10,Lucifer,"You used to be a hero Sam. Hell, you beat me. Now... I look at you and I don’t even recognise you anymore."
11,10,Dean [yelling],Sam! Sammy!
11,10,Dean,You son-of-a-bitch.
11,10,Crowley,"Miss you too, puddin’."
11,10,Dean,Where are you? Where’s Sam?
11,10,Crowley,"Ah, there was a bit of a hiccup. Your brother is in Hell, with Lucifer."
11,10,Sam,Stull Cemetery.
11,10,Lucifer,I know; where the title fight went down.
11,10,Past Castiel,"Hey, assbutt!"
11,10,Lucifer,"'Assbutt,' I-I-I still don't get that."
11,10,Sam,"Look, I appreciate the stroll down memory lane, but..."
11,10,Lucifer,"Sam, have I ever told you how much I respect you?"
11,10,Sam,What?
11,10,Lucifer,"Oh, don't get me wrong, I don't like you. I never liked you. You're... you're sort of prissy. But in this moment, when you stood toe to toe with me and won, I gotta say, you had balls kid."
11,10,Past Sam,"It’s okay, Dean. It’s gonna be okay. I got him."
11,10,Lucifer,"You were willing to do the hard thing, if it meant saving the world."
11,10,Lucifer,"That’s not you anymore. You’ve gone soft, Sammy."
11,10,Castiel,Who are you?
11,10,Ambriel,"Ambriel. I work in birth death statistics, in Heaven. I’m... I’m an angel."
11,10,Castiel,"Yeah, I know."
11,10,Ambriel,And you’re Castiel. I’ve heard stories about you.
11,10,Castiel,Why are you here?
11,10,Ambriel,Same reason you are.
11,10,Castiel,Heaven wants to know if the Darkness has been destroyed.
11,10,Ambriel,"Yeah, pretty much."
11,10,Castiel,And they sent you?
11,10,Ambriel,Are you going to kill me?
11,10,Castiel,"Is that what they say, that I kill angels?"
11,10,Ambriel,"Well, that’s the nicest thing they say. Well, maybe we can work together... so no-one murders anyone."
11,10,Ambriel,"Okay, so I’ve searched the east end of the forest. Nothing weird."
11,10,Castiel,Really? You know it is the middle of the afternoon.
11,10,Ambriel,Sooo...
11,10,Castiel,"So, why is it dark?"
11,10,Ambriel,Excellent question.
11,10,Dean,"Hey Cas, I know you’re fighting the good fight right now, but, ah, I need you at Third and Pine, Kenesaw, Nebraska, because, ah, I’m going to Hell."
11,10,Billie,Password?
11,10,Dean,"Crowley sent me alright, just open up."
11,10,Billie,Password!
11,10,Dean [frustrated],Really?
11,10,Billie,"Nice work, Bieber."
11,10,Dean,"Yeah, funny for a demon."
11,10,Billie,Not a demon. Name’s Billie.
11,10,Dean,"The reaper, Billie? My brother says you want to kill us."
11,10,Billie,"No. I’m just gonna make sure that when you die, you stay dead. Subtle difference."
11,10,Dean,"So what, you work for Crowley?"
11,10,Billie,"With, not for. Strange days, Winchester. Times like this, it doesn’t hurt to have the King owe you a favor."
11,10,Billie,For the limey.
11,10,Dean,What is it?
11,10,Billie,You’ll see.
11,10,Dean,"Whatever. Alright, just get me when I need to go."
11,10,Billie,That’s the plan.
11,10,Billie,Watch your step. It’s a long way down.
11,10,Past Sam,Thought about what you’re going to say to him?
11,10,Amelia,I’ve thought about it and thought about it. I still don’t know...
11,10,Lucifer,"This is where it all changed, Sammy."
11,10,Amelia,It’s just all so surreal.
11,10,Lucifer,This is the worst thing you’ve ever done.
11,10,Past Sam,Does he know that they told you he was killed in action?
11,10,Sam,Really?
11,10,Lucifer,"After the Leviathans, when your brother was trapped in Purgatory, you were here... with a girl and a dog. You didn’t even bother trying to find him."
11,10,Sam,"You know what? Not that I have to defend myself to you, but Dean and I promised we wouldn’t look for each other."
11,10,Lucifer,"Right... and if he never came back you’d be fine. But he did. So you’re not. Whatever happened to the Sam Winchester who was bold, decisive, and ready to sacrifice for the greater good?"
11,10,Sam,Right here.
11,10,Lucifer,And... so why did you let Dean talk you out of closing the gates of Hell? ‘Cos the old Sam never would’ve done that. Not ever.
11,10,Sam,I didn’t...
11,10,Lucifer,"No wait, here’s my personal favorite, is you doing every stupid thing you could to cure the Mark, even after you knew it would go bad."
11,10,Sam [angry],My brother was dying!
11,10,Lucifer,"Yes! And you’d do anything to save him. And he’d do anything to save you. And that is the problem. Because of this [Lucifer points to Past Sam and Amelia]... you’re so overcome by guilt that you can’t stand to lose Dean again and he could never lose you, and so instead of choosing the world you choose each other, no matter how many innocent people die."
11,10,Sam [angry],You’re going to lecture me about hurting people? You?
11,10,Lucifer,"You know I’m right Sam. You know it! And I know if you’re going to beat the Darkness you have to be ready to die. You have to be ready to watch the people you love die. A long time ago you could have fought the good fight kid, but not anymore. You can’t win this one Sam. You’re just not strong enough."
11,10,Sam,And you are?
11,10,Lucifer,"Hey, snappin' necks and cashin' checks is what I do."
11,10,Rowena,Isn’t this nice? Spending quality time?
11,10,Demon,Your tea is ready.
11,10,Crowley,Finally.
11,10,Rowena,That does sound lovely.
11,10,Demon,How do you take it?
11,10,Rowena,"Like mother, like son."
11,10,Crowley,Excuse me. I need to go vomit.
11,10,Rowena,Hurry back dear. [Rowena pats Crowley’s jacket as he leaves].
11,10,Castiel,"I never wanted this, you know. To be hated by my own kind, I never..."
11,10,Ambriel,"Oh no, I don't hate you, Castiel."
11,10,Castiel,Thank you.
11,10,Ambriel,"I mean, we have a lot in common. Our names rhyme, that's a big one. I look good in a trench coat too, and we're both expendable."
11,10,Castiel,Excuse me?
11,10,Ambriel,"Well, that's why we're here, right? I'm a number cruncher and you... like I said, I've heard the stories. You help. But Sam and Dean Winchester are the real heroes. So, if the Darkness is still alive and she's pissed... and she kills us... no big loss. So sure, maybe we're not super important, but we do the job. You know... I think there's nobility in that."
11,10,Ambriel,You coming?
11,10,Castiel,I’ll catch up.
11,10,Crowley,Welcome to Hell.
11,10,Dean,Where’s Sam?
11,10,Crowley,Don’t worry about Sam.
11,10,Dean,I’m sorry. Have you met me?
11,10,Crowley,"I mean Lucifer needs the moose. He’s not going to kill him, probably. You versus the Devil... trust me there’s easier ways of committing suicide. We need to focus on Rowena."
11,10,Dean,"Okay, great. Let’s kill her."
11,10,Crowley,Easier said than done I’m afraid. And we need Mother to slam the Devil back in his hole.
11,10,Dean,"Well, is she going to play ball?"
11,10,Crowley,She doesn’t have a choice.
11,10,Crowley,"It’s called a witch-catcher. Most of them were destroyed after the Inquisition, but, ah, Billie came through."
11,10,Dean,"Yeah, she’s a peach. What does it do?"
11,10,Crowley,You’re going to love this.
11,10,Castiel,Ambriel!
11,10,Amara,Castiel?
11,10,Castiel,"Amara, what did you do to her?"
11,10,Amara,"I consumed her. Her grace, her spark, her memories, everything... she... oh, she really hit the spot."
11,10,Amara,"Seriously? I mean Heaven brought the thunder and it barely even scratched my paint job. But you and a shiny knife, sure, that’s gonna work."
11,10,Castiel,You think I'm afraid to die?
11,10,Amara,I know you are. You reek of fear and self loathing.
11,10,Amara,"Oh, scary."
11,10,Amara,"She's right you know, you are expendable and weak. And why God took a special interest in you, I'll never understand. My brother always did have horrible taste in men."
11,10,Castiel,Just do it.
11,10,Amara,"Blue eyes, you’re not even worth the effort... and no offence, but you look a bit used up. Plus, I have a job for you."
11,10,Billie,Hey.
11,10,INTERIOR,Rowena is drinking her cup of tea when Crowley returns.
11,10,Rowena,How’s Dean?
11,10,Crowley,Pardon?
11,10,Rowena,"Little tip, love. The next time you go about making secret plans, check your pockets."
11,10,Crowley,You heard?
11,10,Rowena,Everything.
11,10,Dean,Not that it matters.
11,10,Rowena,"What does that mean, big boy?"
11,10,Crowley,A little tip Mother. Never accept a cup of tea from someone who loathes you.
11,10,Rowena [screaming],Get this off bloody thing off of me.
11,10,Crowley,"I would, but this bloody thing makes you my slave."
11,10,Crowley,"Hop, on one foot."
11,10,Rowena,"Please, Fergus. I don't know what kind of Oedipal Fifty Shades you think you're playing at but if you think for a second..."
11,10,Rowena,Bullocks.
11,10,Dean,"Alright, let’s do this."
11,10,Lucifer,"Now Sam, I know this is a lot to take in, so if you need to take some time and noodle on it, that’s cool. But, ah, world is ending [Lucifer points to his watch], clock ticking. You follow me?"
11,10,Sam,What do you want me to say?
11,10,Lucifer,"A little word that starts with Y, ends in E-S."
11,10,Lucifer,"Okay, you don't like me. I get it... I get it; sometimes I don't like me either. But Gabriel and Raphael are dead. God went out for a pack of smokes and never came back... and Michael... well, let's just say prison life hasn't really agreed with Michael. These days he's usually sitting in a corner singing show tunes and touching himself."
11,10,Sam,So you're it.
11,10,Lucifer [laughing],"I'm it! And hey, I'm not the good guy, we both know I'm not, but the Darkness, she's the end of everything."
11,10,Lucifer,"But I can beat her. We can beat her. You and me, together. So come on, Sam. Make the right choice, the big sacrifice one more time, man. Sam, it's time to save the world, man."
11,10,Sam [quietly],No. No.
11,10,Dean,So this spell is supposed to slam Lucifer back in the box. How long’s this gonna take?
11,10,Rowena,About five minutes. Unless Sam says yes.
11,10,Crowley,And if he does?
11,10,Rowena,"If Lucifer finds a vessel, he’ll be anchored to earth. The incantation won’t work."
11,10,Dean,And then we’re screwed.
11,10,Demon,"I’m sorry my lord, I tried to..."
11,10,Dean,Cas?
11,10,Crowley [sarcastically],"Oh good, the angel is here."
11,10,Dean,What’s happened?
11,10,Castiel,Amara. She... she’s alive. She... she sent this message...
11,10,Crowley,I am coming. Is that a threat?
11,10,Dean,Or a promise.
11,10,Lucifer [angry],What do you mean no?
11,10,Sam,You heard me.
11,10,Lucifer,"Okay, now Sam, I gotta tell you, this is selfish, man, everything..."
11,10,Sam,You are done. It’s over.
11,10,Sam,"You know what? You talk a good game. You do. Hell, you almost had me sold a few times. But then I thought what if you’re right? What if you’re telling the truth? What if you can beat her?"
11,10,Lucifer [yelling],I can!
11,10,Sam,"Even though the last time it took you, plus three other archangels. Oh yeah, and capital G, God."
11,10,Lucifer,"Oh okay, what, you mean the dead weight?"
11,10,Sam,"Well, let’s say you gank her... then what?"
11,10,Lucifer [shrugging],I move to LA... solve crimes.
11,10,Sam,"Wrong. Then you go about starting the Apocalypse, again, because you're an old dog and that's your old trick."
11,10,Lucifer,"Okay, first off, you don't know that. Second, even if I did that's better than what she has planned."
11,10,Sam,"Is it? Really? 'Cause this is what I think, I think that whoever wins, you or the Darkness, everyone else loses. So, no. My answer is no. This isn't because of Dean, or the past, this is about me having faith in my friends, having faith in my family. We will find a way. I'm ready to die and I'm ready to watch people I love die, but I'm not ready to be your bitch."
11,10,Lucifer,"Okay, plan B."
11,10,Dean,Sam!
11,10,Crowley [desperately],Don’t!
11,10,Castiel,"Hey, ass-butt!"
11,10,Lucifer,"Dean, ah, the other one."
11,10,Lucifer,Welcome to the party.
11,10,Lucifer,Scared?
11,10,Dean,Not even a little.
11,10,Lucifer,"Ah, ah, ah... moments like this, it’s all about ambiance."
11,10,Lucifer,I can beat the Darkness. Me. Only me.
11,10,Dean,Are you okay?
11,10,Sam,Yeah.
11,10,Lucifer,[Indecipherable]. You know I’m right Castiel. You know it?
11,10,Lucifer,You wanna play that way?
11,10,Sam,We can’t win.
11,10,Dean,We don’t have to win. We’ve just gotta last a few minutes.
11,10,Lucifer,"Alright Sam, I’m gonna make this real easy for you. You say the magic word or your brother dies... and we both know you won’t let that happen"
11,10,Rowena,You’re welcome... anyone?
11,10,Dean,Bite me!
11,10,Crowley,I can make her do that.
11,10,Sam,So what now?
11,10,Crowley,About the Darkness? No clue.
11,10,Dean,We’ll figure it out.
11,10,Rowena,Or die screaming.
11,10,Crowley,"This has been a horrible train wreck, so we’re done. Team up over."
11,10,Crowley,She stays. The rest of you lot... get the hell out of Hell.
11,10,Castiel,I think so. I will be.
11,10,Dean,You want me to give you a lift?
11,10,Castiel,"No, you two go on ahead. I’ll catch up."
11,10,Dean,Okay.
11,10,Sam,Is he alright?
11,10,Dean,Tough day.
11,10,Sam,Yeah. Tell me about it.
11,10,Dean,You good?
11,10,Sam,"I don’t know. I mean what if Lucifer was telling the truth, you know, what if he’s the only..."
11,10,Dean,"No, dude, the Darkness is bad. Her and the Devil, that’s a nightmare."
11,10,Crowley,"Mother, why do you hate me?"
11,10,Rowena,"I hate you, because when I look into your eyes I see the woman I used to be, before magic, before the coven... when I was nothing but Rowena, the tanner's daughter... a pale, scared little girl, who smelled of filth and death. [Rowena starts to massage Crowley’s shoulders]. I hate you, because when you were born, your father said he loved me, then he went back to his grand wife and his grand house, whilst I lay pathetic and half dead on a straw mat... my thighs slick with blood. [Rowena bends down so that she is talking right into Crowley’s ear, tears spilling]. I hate you, because if I didn't, I'd love you. But love... love is weakness. And I'll never be weak again."
11,10,Crowley,Castiel?
11,10,Castiel,Guess again.
11,10,Lucifer,Last words?
11,10,Castiel,Can you really beat her?
11,10,Lucifer,I can.
11,10,Castiel,"Then, yes."
11,10,Rowena [purring],Lucifer.
11,10,Crowley,You can’t be. You finished the spell.
11,10,Rowena,But if he was already in another vessel.
11,10,Lucifer [gleefully],Loophole!
11,10,Crowley,Bloody hell.
11,10,Lucifer,"Ooh, Rowena..."
11,10,Rowena,My liege.
11,10,Lucifer,"You know, what you’ve done for me, I’ll never forget it."
11,10,Rowena,Twas my honor.
11,10,Lucifer,"Yes, twas... you deserve a reward... [Lucifer touches Rowena’s nose, then her lips with his finger]... or some little token of my affection."
11,10,Rowena [breathlessly],Thank you.
11,10,Lucifer,"Oh, just one teensy tiny little question. Can anyone else open the Cage?"
11,10,Rowena,Just me.
11,10,Lucifer,Good.
11,10,Lucifer,"Okay, let’s chat."
11,13,Melissa,Here honey let me (She straightens Dan’s tie)
11,13,Dan,Thanks babe (Melissa kisses him)
11,13,Melissa,Since the day I met you (ringing doorbell) doesn’t stacy know to knock. She’ll wake Tegan
11,13,Dan,She’s getting ready (Stacy kisses him)
11,13,Stacy,Ew I can taste her mom lipstick…you’re telling her tonight right?
11,13,Dan,It’s valentines day
11,13,Stacy,So?
11,13,Dan,So that’s heartless…can’t we talk about this later?
11,13,Stacy,I’m tired of waiting
11,13,Dan,"I told you it’s not that simple. Mel and I…we’ve been together since we were your age. We have a house, a baby…we have a whole life together"
11,13,Stacy,"Dan, don’t you get it that’s what I want. Either tell her tonight or…"
11,13,Dan,Or what
11,13,Stacy,Melissa you look so pretty. (Melissa walks in the room) I love your lipstick.
11,13,Melissa,Thanks…you ready?
11,13,Dan,Mhmm
11,13,Stacy,You scared the hell out of me. What are you doing here? (He massages her shoulders) Mmm that feels good.
11,13,Dean,Morning (Dean stumbles in and opens the fridge and pulls out some Chinese leftovers and takes a bite)
11,13,Sam,Is that a hickey? (Dean spits out his food)
11,13,Dean,And? It was valentine’s day. I can’t help it if I’m a hopeless romantic.
11,13,Sam,You got half of that right.
11,13,Dean,Just doing my civic duty. Helping all the single ladies. You know the best thing about February 14th. You don’t have to be mr right. Just mr right now
11,13,Sam,That’s classy
11,13,Dean,"Yeah and what’d you do judgy? Curl up in your snuggie, watch 50 shades on cable?"
11,13,Sam,Yeah…no. check this out. Stacy altman 19 year old babysitter from Hudson ohio was murdered last night.
11,13,Dean,"Oh that blows. But if her name’s not Amara, how is that us?"
11,13,Sam,Because her heart was ripped out
11,13,Dean,On valentines day? What is that like an ironic werewolf? Alright we’ll check it out. But first I need bacon.
11,13,Sam,No first you need a shower.
11,13,Dean,Is it (Dean sniffs his armpits and makes a face) you’re not wrong.
11,13,Sam,Yeah.
11,13,Dan,It’s like we told the cops. Stacy came over about 6 oclock. We went to dinner by the time we got home
11,13,Melissa,"We found Stacy in the living room, in a pool of blood; Tegan in her crib hysterical. It was awful"
11,13,Dean,Can you think of any reason someone would want to hurt Stacy?
11,13,Melissa,No. Stacy was super sweet and popular and pretty
11,13,Dan,Anyone who met her fell in love with her
11,13,Dean,Maybe it was a crime of passion. Stacy have any crazy ex-boyfriends
11,13,Melissa,Not that I know of... Honey?
11,13,Dan,Why would I have any idea?
11,13,Sam,Was anything stolen? Any chance this may have been a robbery gone wrong?
11,13,Melissa,I don’t think so. I mean nothing was missing. Except for the nanny cam in the living room.
11,13,Sam,Thanks for your time. (They start to walk out) Give us a call if something comes up.
11,13,Melissa,Okay thank you
11,13,Sam,Is it just me or is that guy acting a bit hinky?
11,13,Dean,Yeah I was thinking the same thing.
11,13,Sam,Let’s split up. You can drop my off at the morgue and hit Dan at the office
11,13,Dean,Yeah maybe he’ll be a little more open without his wifey around.
11,13,ME,Based on the autopsy the vic was conscious when her heart was ripped out. Wouldn’t want a front row seat to that show.
11,13,Sam,Any ideas what could have done this
11,13,ME,Typically I’d assume animal attack
11,13,Sam,In the house?
11,13,ME,"Exactly. Plus, no claw marks. I’ll be honest with you, agent. Been doing this for some 20 odd years and I’m stumped."
11,13,Sam,(Takes a picture of the wound) Thanks
11,13,Secretary,Someone’s here to see you Mr. Harper. FBI. An Agent Weller.
11,13,Dan,(closes Facebook) Send him in. Please. (Dean walks in) Please. Have a seat agent. What can I help you with?
11,13,Dean,I need you to be straight with me Dan.
11,13,Dan,I’m not sure what you mean agent.
11,13,Dean,I think you do. I think you’re hiding something. And you didn’t want to talk about it in front of your wife…you’re stooping the babysitter.
11,13,Dan,(Nervous laugh) excuse me?
11,13,Dean,"Oh don’t act all fake offended. I’m actually trying to help you out here. Now personally, I don’t give a rat’s ass who you screw, but I would hate for your…uh…extra-curricular activities to get you involved in a federal murder investigation. (Long silence) Or I could just go talk to your wife."
11,13,Dan,I wanna be straight with you agent. I really do. But I can’t.
11,13,Dean,Sure you can
11,13,Dan,No. Really. I mean this is just too damn weird. You’d never believe me.
11,13,Dean,Try me. (Dan opens a drawer and pulls out a teddy bear) Let me guess. The missing nanny cam.
11,13,Dan,I was having an affair with Stacy. I only took the nanny cam because she kissed me in front of it. I forgot the damn thing was there. (He opens the bear and pulls out an SD card) Anyway. I was gonna erase it as soon as we got home. But then we found Stacy’s body. Melissa ran upstairs for the baby and I…
11,13,Dean,Ran for the cam
11,13,Dan,"I know it was a dick move. But I also know the cam must have recorded the murder. As soon as I erased the kiss I was gonna turn it over to the cops. I swear. Until I saw what was on it. (Dan turns his screen and shows a video of him ripping out Stacy’s heart) I know that’s me, but I swear it wasn’t me. I would never hurt Stacy. I loved her. I was at dinner the entire time. If you don’t believe me, ask Melissa, or the waiter, or any of the 75 other people that were there. You gotta believe me."
11,13,Dean,Relax. I do.
11,13,Dan,You do?
11,13,Dean,(Takes SD card out of computer and puts it in his jacket.) I need you to sit tight. Keep a lid on this for the time being okay?
11,13,Sam,Yo
11,13,Dean,Hey. Find anything.
11,13,Sam,Yeah. Jack. Absolutely nothing points to werewolf.
11,13,Dean,Well. Step aside Urkel. (Dean pulls disk out of his pocket and puts it in Sam’s computer.) It was Dan that stole the nanny cam.
11,13,Sam,Why? (Dean gives Sam a pointed look) He was stooping the sitter. (Sam watches video.) Wait a second. I though Dan was at dinner with Melissa.
11,13,Dean,That’s not Dan.
11,13,Sam,(Sees glowing eyes in video) Shapeshifter.
11,13,Dean,Yahtzee
11,13,Secretary,Is it okay if I head out?
11,13,Dan,(looking out window) Yeah
11,13,Secretary,Are you okay Mr. Harper? I’m happy to stay if you need me. Or maybe you should go home. Be with your family.
11,13,Dan,I’ll be okay Gladys. You have a good night.
11,13,Gladys,Okay. (she leaves towards elevator. Is bumped into by someone leaving elevator) excuse me.
11,13,Dan,Did you forget something? (He turns to see Stacy standing there) Stacy?
11,13,Stacy,uh-huh
11,13,Dan,What’s going on?
11,13,Stacy,I want you to give me your heart.
11,13,Dan,"You’re dead. This isn’t possible. (Dan scrambles away) I saw your heart ripped out of your chest! (She backs him into a wall) Please. What are you doing? What do you want? (She 
rips his heart out)"
11,13,Dean,You were the last person to see your boss alive. Did you notice anything unusual?
11,13,Gladys,"Nothing unusual per se. Just kind of rude. This young girl, brunette, buxom, couldn’t have been more than 19 barrelled out of the elevator as I was leaving. Nearly knocked me over."
11,13,Sam,Is this her? (he shows a picture of Stacy)
11,13,Gladys,Yeah. That’s the girl.
11,13,Dean,Thank you for your time ma’am.
11,13,Sam,Well. Confirms we’re dealing with a shifter
11,13,Dean,Yeah. Who’s upping it’s game by impersonating dead people. I’m guessing it’s the wife.
11,13,Sam,Yeah
11,13,Dean,I’m so sorry for your loss
11,13,Melissa,I just can’t…I can’t even believe it. How is this even possible?
11,13,Sam,That’s what we’re trying to figure out.
11,13,Dean,Where’s the baby?
11,13,Melissa,She’s…she’s with my mom
11,13,Sam,"I…uh…I hate to have to ask this, but I need to ask you a difficult question."
11,13,Melissa,Okay
11,13,Sam,Were you aware that your husband was having an affair with your babysitter?
11,13,Melissa,"Yes. I knew. I know what you’re thinking. Jealous wife kills her cheating husband, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. I loved Dan. Still do. It may sound pathetic, but I thought we still had a chance."
11,13,Sam,Well thank you for your time. We’ll leave you alone. Let you get some rest.
11,13,Dean,"But before we go, would you mind writing down a phone number where we can get ahold of you in case we have anymore questions"
11,13,Melissa,Sure. (Dean slides a silver pen and a business card across the table. Melissa picks up the pen and writes something down)
11,13,Sam,"And if anything strange or out of the ordinary comes up, don’t hesitate to call. We’re staying at the motel on main street."
11,13,Dean,Thanks. (they walk out) Alright so Melissa’s not the shifter.
11,13,Sam,And we are back to square zilch
11,13,Dean,"I need a beer, regroup, maybe get lucky"
11,13,Sam,Didn’t you just get lucky?
11,13,Dean,That was in Kansas. What do you say? You with me? Ready to go scrape a few hearts off the bar room floor?
11,13,Sam,"(laughs) I think I’ll pass. I’m gonna go hit the lore, but you go be you."
11,13,Dean,Suit yourself
11,13,Melissa,"hey it’s me. I think I messed up. I don’t know what happened, but something went wrong. Now Dan is dead and the FBI are asking questions. Just call me back. ASAP."
11,13,Dan,"Honey. Let me in. (She jumps away from the door) Baby, it’s me."
11,13,Melissa,No it’s not
11,13,Dan,"honey, please let me in. I love you. (She continues backing away. He punches through the door. She screams. He opens the door.) Don’t worry honey. I’m not gonna hurt you. I’m your husband. (She screams again, runs away, sprays him with mace, breaks a flower pot over his head, grabs her purse, and runs out the door.)"
11,13,Dean,Hey. Any luck?
11,13,Sam,No. You?
11,13,Dean,Nah. Hey what’s a…uh…dad bod? (frantic knocking. Dean opens the door.) Hey there. (Melissa scrambles in and locks the door) Everything okay?
11,13,Melissa,No. Dan tried to kill me.
11,13,Dean,"Dan, your dead husband, Dan?"
11,13,Melissa,You told me to come to you if anything strange or out of the ordinary happened? Well it did. And I think it’s all my fault.
11,13,Dean,Okay why don’t you come sit down. C’mon.
11,13,Melissa,I swear. I really did love Dan. Maybe a little too much. I just…I wanted him to love me back. So I got some advice and I confided in my hairdresser about the affair.
11,13,Dean,"Wait, women actually do that?"
11,13,Melissa,And she told me there was a way to get him back. I knew she…uh…dabbled in stuff.
11,13,Sam,Wait a second. What kind of stuff are you talking about here?
11,13,Melissa,"She calls herself a uh…white witch. Listen I don’t know if you believe in that sort of thing. I usually don’t, but I was desperate."
11,13,Dean,And let me guess. She gave you a spell
11,13,Melissa,yes. A return to love spell. All I had to do was chant it and seal it with a kiss. I didn’t mean for any of this to happen. I swear. I just wanted my husband back.
11,13,Sam,Do you happen to have a copy of the spell on you?
11,13,Melissa,Oh. Yes. Yes. (She hands a piece of paper to Sam who opens his laptop)
11,13,Sam,Wow. Okay for starters. Not a spell. More like an Aramaic curse.
11,13,Melissa,What?
11,13,Sam,This roughly translates to the kiss of death.
11,13,Melissa,I swear. She never told me that.
11,13,Dean,What does the lore say?
11,13,Sam,There is no lore. My best guess is that this is the white witch’s home cooking.
11,13,Dean,"Terrific. Alright so what do we know. Um, you kiss someone then they die"
11,13,Sam,I guess. Wait a second. You didn’t kiss Stacy?
11,13,Melissa,No of course not
11,13,Dean,No but Dan did
11,13,Sam,So the curse is transmittable?
11,13,Dean,Like a magic STD. Okay that works. Kinda makes you nostalgic for good old fashioned herpes.
11,13,Melissa,Oh god. I killed Dan and Stacy.
11,13,Sam,You didn’t kill anyone. This is all on that witch.
11,13,Dean,Riddle me this. Why did Stacy die first if she was kissed second?
11,13,Sam,I don’t know. Maybe you’re safe if you can pass the curse on?
11,13,Dean,And then if that person dies then it comes back to you?
11,13,Sam,"I mean that would make sense. It would explain why, whatever this is, is working it’s way back to Melissa"
11,13,Melissa,I’m sorry. I’m confused
11,13,Dean,"Yeah cause it’s freaking confusing. Look long story short, it’s like a game of hot potato. You gotta keep paying it forward. You don’t, you die."
11,13,Sam,"Melissa. This curse, it started with you. And I think it wants to end with you."
11,13,Dean,But don’t worry. Okay? We’re not gonna let that happen.
11,13,Sam,What the hell did you do?
11,13,Dean,Come on. Let’s just go. (They run to the Impala and leave. He pulls the car over.) I’d say that went pretty well. What do you think?
11,13,Sam,(getting out of the car with Dean) Wait. Are you serious? You think it’s a great idea to give yourself a fatal curse?
11,13,Dean,Well targets off her back ain’t it
11,13,Sam,I’m just saying. You don’t have to do this. Be the guinea pig.
11,13,Dean,What?
11,13,Sam,Be the martyr. Try to carry the weight by yourself. Do this.
11,13,Dean,"I’m gonna be fine, okay? And as long as I’m good, she’s good and that’s the important thing. Besides. It proved our theory didn’t it. That this whole kiss of death thing is transmittable. I mean I’m not asking for the nobel here, but thank you."
11,13,Sam,How long do you think we have?
11,13,Dean,I don’t know. I mean it’s not like this thing is exactly following a pattern. I don’t even know what I’m looking for here. We cut out of there pretty quick though so maybe I bought us some time.
11,13,Melissa,What was that?
11,13,Dean,"We think it was something called a shapeshifter, but it can’t be because I pumped the thing full of silver and it didn’t even flinch."
11,13,Melissa,What kind of FBI agents are you?
11,13,Dean,The fake kind.
11,13,Sam,We’re hunters
11,13,Melissa,Hunters?
11,13,Dean,Look all you need to know is we save people like you from things like that.
11,13,Sam,"Even if it’s not a shapeshifter, it’s still shifting shapes. If we can find out what it is we can find out how to kill it."
11,13,Dean,Alright. What do you know about the white witch.
11,13,Melissa,Not much. Her name is Sonja. She’s kind of weird. I don’t know. She’s only been my hairdresser for a couple of months.
11,13,Dean,Do you know where she lives?
11,13,Melissa,Not a clue
11,13,Sam,Where did she give you the spell?
11,13,Melissa,In the basement of her salon
11,13,Dean,(reading the sign) The art of dyeing. Well. Can’t say she didn’t warn ya.
11,13,Sam,"Alright, just keep the doors locked and stay put until we get back. Unless Sonja shows up. Then use this on her. (he pulls out a knife)"
11,13,Dean,It won’t kill her but it’ll slow her down.
11,13,Melissa,Are you serious? I can’t stab anyone!
11,13,Sam,Come on
11,13,Dean,"Listen to me. Sonja’s not just anyone. She’s a wicked witch who offed your husband and tried to kill you, so if she shows up here you punch her, you stab her, you drop a freaking house on her if you have to."
11,13,Sam,Witch killing bullets
11,13,Dean,We gotta come up with a better name than that.
11,13,Sam,Locked cabinet. (pries off door) Lookie here.
11,13,Dean,hey hey
11,13,Sam,Alright (pulls out book) got it. It looks like we’re dealing with a Qareen.
11,13,Dean,Never heard of it
11,13,Sam,"It’s a creature, corporeal in form. A slave to your commands."
11,13,Dean,Kinda like a genie
11,13,Sam,"I guess. Here we go. Someone chants a curse, lays a wet one on you, then the victim is seduced and killed by the Qareen, but instead of taking the form of Barbara Eden, the present themselves as your deepest, darkest desire."
11,13,Dean,Makes sense why the sitter was killed by the husband. The husband by the sitter.
11,13,Sam,Yeah. And why Melissa was attacked by Dan. She really loved him.
11,13,Dean,(laughs)
11,13,Sam,What?
11,13,Dean,You know the silver lining about being cursed? I’ll finally get some face time with Daisy Duke. My deepest darkest desire.
11,13,Sam,Seriously?
11,13,Dean,Ever since I was seven
11,13,Sam,So Bach not Simpson
11,13,Dean,"Eh. Guess I wouldn’t say no to either. Alright, how do we kill it?"
11,13,Sam,By stabbing it in it’s heart.
11,13,Dean,(looks at the picture in the book) Well given that it has a giant hole in it’s chest does it even have a heart?
11,13,Sam,Apparently not in him. The person who holds the Qareen’s heart is the one who commands it.
11,13,Dean,So Sonja the hairdresser.
11,13,Sam,"Alright, let’s find us a heart. I’ll take upstairs."
11,13,Sam,Whatever. I’m going upstairs.
11,13,Dean,Okay
11,13,Dean,Find anything? (He turns to see Amara)
11,13,Amara,I understand Dean.
11,13,Dean,Is that right?
11,13,Amara,"the longing in your heart, I feel it too."
11,13,Dean,(inching towards the knife) Well that’s touching. Consider that you don’t have a heart. Qareen.
11,13,Back upstairs,
11,13,Sonja,(takes box from Sam and closes it) I’m guessing you’re not really FBI. What? A hunter?
11,13,Sam,And you’re a witch. Hocking death curses as love spells.
11,13,Sonja,"Someone has to punish these men. But you know the only thing worse than a cheating man, is one who gets away with it."
11,13,Sam,Wow. You’re practically a feminist.
11,13,Amara,Who I am doesn’t matter. The real question is who are you?
11,13,Dean,What do you mean who am I?
11,13,Amara,"You’re a mystery. I can see inside your heart. Feel the love you feel. Except it’s cloaked in shame. When it comes to this, you can’t help yourself, so why fight it. Just give in."
11,13,Back upstairs,
11,13,Sam,Why hurt Melissa? She only wanted to save her marriage.
11,13,Sonja,"They all do. Hundreds of heartbroken women come to me, but they never learn. I mean, a month, a year, however long later, they all come back. Same story, different men."
11,13,Sam,So you tweaked the curse.
11,13,Sonja,"Now it not only punishes the cheaters, but the foolish women who want them back. Guess I’m just weeding out the idiots. And you’re next."
11,13,Dean,"Yeah. You know what? You’re right. The real Amara does have a hold on me, but you? Are nothing but a cheap imitation. (Amara attacks. Dean evades)"
11,13,Melissa,Sonja stop! (Scene cuts back to Dean evading Amara’s attacks and then back upstairs) Please. Enough. It’s enough.
11,13,Sam,Dean!
11,13,Dean,Yeah!
11,13,Sam,So. I got it.
11,13,Dean,Yeah.
11,13,Sam,It’s done.
11,13,Dean,You good?
11,13,Sam,Yeah. You good?
11,13,Dean,Mhmm. Yeah. (Dean leaves. Sam looks around and sees the wreckage and then follows him out.
11,13,Sam,So. You gonna keep me in suspense here or what?
11,13,Dean,About what?
11,13,Sam,Who was it? Bach or Simpson?
11,13,Dean,Neither
11,13,Sam,Huh
11,13,Dean,It was Amara
11,13,Sam,That surprise you?
11,13,Dean,That doesn’t surprise you?
11,13,Sam,Honestly?
11,13,Dean,Honestly? You seriously think the sister of God is my deepest darkest desire?
11,13,Sam,She isn’t?
11,13,Dean,No! She can’t be!
11,13,Sam,Why not?
11,13,Dean,Why? Because if she is that means that I’m…
11,13,Sam,Means you’re what? Complicit? Weak? Evil?
11,13,Dean,"For starters, yeah"
11,13,Sam,"Dean. Do you honestly think you ever had a choice in the matter? She’s the sister of God, and for some reason she picked you and that sucks, but if you think I’m gonna blame you or judge you…I’m not."
11,13,Dean,You know that I want her ass dead
11,13,Sam,"Yes. Of course. And I know you’ve also probably beaten yourself up a hundred times over it, but where has that gotten us? (Long silence) Just how bad is it?"
11,13,Dean,"Standing here right now, every bone in my body wants to run her through. Send her back to that hole she crawled out of. But when I’m near her, I don’t know. Something happens and I can’t explain it, but to call it desire or love…it’s not that. I’m screwed man. We wanna kill the darkness. We need to kill the darkness. And I don’t think I can. I’m sorry to do that to you, ya know, but when it comes right down to it…"
11,13,Sam,I got it Dean.
11,15,INTERIOR,"Inside a hall in Brimson, Missouri there is a wrestling match underway."
11,15,Announcer,"Oh, but only a two count. The rookie, Shawn Harley, fails to take The Hangman down."
11,15,Announcer,Ooh. A stinger to the neck.
11,15,Harley,Are you seriously drunk right now?
11,15,The Hangman,Just shut up and get ready.
11,15,Announcer,"Ooh, and it’s a stinger to the back."
11,15,The Hangman,He’s going in.
11,15,Announcer,Takes him to the turnbuckle.
11,15,Announcer,"Oh, and we know what’s coming next."
11,15,The Hangman,"Bring it on, baby! It’s all over. I’m gonna hang his ass."
11,15,The Hangman,"Oh, yeah, baby."
11,15,Announcer,"It’s all over now, folks. We have lift-off."
11,15,Announcer,As Harley’s struggling to breath now. He’s turning blue.
11,15,INTERIOR,In the locker room after the wrestling match and the Hangman is looking into his locker.
11,15,The Hangman,Has anyone seen my rope?
11,15,Harley,What the hell? I almost died out there.
11,15,Harley,You’re gonna take the wino’s side? Really?
11,15,Gunner,That’s not what this is...
11,15,Harley,"Whatever. You old-timers like to stick together, right? Well, do us a favor, keep a leash on your boy or he might get hurt."
11,15,The Hangman,Hey!
11,15,Sam,"Hey, have you seen the, um..."
11,15,Sam,Ah. Yeah. Thanks.
11,15,Dean,"Yeah, bottoms up."
11,15,Sam,Yeah. What’s with the bag?
11,15,Dean,You remember Top Notch Wrestling?
11,15,Sam,"Yeah. Those, uh, wrestling shows Dad took us to when we were kids."
11,15,Dean,Right. Came across an obituary last night. Larry ‘The Hangman’ Lee died.
11,15,Sam,"Oh no. Wasn't he, uh..."
11,15,Dean,"He was Dad's favorite. Anytime that noose would come out, Dad would be on his feet. It was one of the few times I ever saw him actually happy."
11,15,Sam,Yeah. I remember that.
11,15,Dean,"Anyway, the, uh, funeral’s less than a day’s drive. I say we go pay our respects."
11,15,Sam,"Uh... don’t you think our plates are a little full? I mean it’s bad out there, Dean."
11,15,Dean,"Yeah, Sam. You think I don’t know that? We’ve done nothing but mainline lore for a week, okay? We’ve got jack on another hand of God and Amara, and we’ve got even less jack on how to save Cas."
11,15,Sam,If he wants to be saved.
11,15,Dean,He does... even if he doesn’t know it yet.
11,15,Sam,Dean...
11,15,Dean,"I’m burnt, man. Okay? And I need... WE need to get out of here. Let’s go stretch our legs."
11,15,INTERIOR,"In Crowley’s lair, Lucifer is looking at a clipboard and directing the demons."
11,15,Lucifer,"Oh, good. Yes. Remember, A-B-C. 'Always be closing.' The sooner you little storm clouds find me another Hand of God, the happier I will be."
11,15,Lucifer,"You want me to be happy, don’t you, Dollface?"
11,15,Simmons,"Of course, my Lord."
11,15,Lucifer,"Good answer. All right. You're gonna look high, look low, far and wide. Search every warehouse, every farmhouse, every henhouse, outhouse, and doghouse."
11,15,Lucifer,"What about you, little puppy? You have something to add?"
11,15,Lucifer,Really?
11,15,Crowley [gasping],I would tell you. I swear.
11,15,Lucifer,I believe you.
11,15,Crowley,May I return to my task?
11,15,Lucifer,"Oh, of course."
11,15,Lucifer,"Ah, ah. Just one minor tweak."
11,15,Lucifer,Use your tongue.
11,15,INTERIOR,Sam and Dean enter a room full of mourners for the funeral of The Hangman.
11,15,Dean,"Dude, check it out. It’s ‘The Scream’ Casey Lyons."
11,15,Sam,"Oh, yeah."
11,15,Dean,There’s Wrecking Ball Calhoon. Wow. The Brooklyn Beast?
11,15,Sam,What happened to ‘em? They’re all... broken.
11,15,Dean,Dude. Dude! Gunnar freakin’ Lawless.
11,15,Sam,Hmm. Groupie much?
11,15,Dean,Shut up. Should I go say hi? I should go say hi. I’m gonna go say hi.
11,15,Dean,"Hi, s-sir. I, uh, saw you... saw you standing over here and told my brother that I... I should could over and say hi... so I came over and, uh... Hi."
11,15,Gunnar,Gunnar Lawless.
11,15,Dean,"Oh, I know. I... I got to tell you. I... worshipped you, growing up."
11,15,Gunnar,Thanks.
11,15,Gunnar,I plan on keeping that hand.
11,15,Dean,"Oh, sorry. You know, when I was... when I was 10, I got my first B&E from borrowing some family's pay-per-view so I could watch the cage match between you and the Tower of Power."
11,15,Gunnar,"I’m not sure how I feel about contributing to your juvenile delinquency, but appreciate it all the same."
11,15,Dean,"Yeah, uh... you were robbed, by the way."
11,15,Gunnar,You bet your ass I was.
11,15,Dean,"Oh, yes."
11,15,Sam,Hey. You’re Rio.
11,15,Sam,"Y-you used to manage Superbomb Sanchez, right?"
11,15,Rio,Oh. That was a long time ago.
11,15,Sam,"Well, yeah, b-but you... you... you look great."
11,15,Sam,Sorry. Uh... wrong place. It’s just y-you were my... my first crush.
11,15,Rio,"Ah. You weren’t one of those guys that had my poster above his bed, were you?"
11,15,Sam,Are you still managing?
11,15,Rio,"Oh. Nah. I call some matches sometimes, but I’m mostly behind the curtain, you know, booking the shows and taking care of the guys."
11,15,Sam,Yeah. Must be hard to see one go.
11,15,Rio,"Yeah, well... we spent a lot of time on the road together. We’re like family, and lately, I’ve seen too many of my boys be put in the dirt. I knew Hangman for 25 years. He was a good man. Great family. I just can’t believe he would do this."
11,15,Sam,Do what?
11,15,Rio,Kill himself.
11,15,Sam,Wait. That wasn’t in the obituary.
11,15,Rio,"Ah, the family didn’t want that advertised, so... speaking of which, if you’ll excuse me."
11,15,Dean,Poor soon of a bitch.
11,15,Sam,"Yeah. You know, uh, word is..."
11,15,Dean,"Yeah. I heard. Hey, you know they’re having a memorial show tonight? And I know you’re itching to get back, but, uh..."
11,15,Sam,We should go to it.
11,15,Dean,Really?
11,15,Sam,"Why not? World’s still gonna be screwed tomorrow, right?"
11,15,Dean,Yeah.
11,15,INTERIOR,"Inside a hall, Rio is announcing the wrestling match."
11,15,Rio [yelling],Are you ready?
11,15,Dean,"Yeah. Well, you drink enough, it’ll be just like old times."
11,15,Sam,"Oh, shut up. Dude, we met at the wake. She’s nice."
11,15,Dean,Did you tell her you used to have a poster of her over your bed when you were a kid?
11,15,Sam,No.
11,15,Dean,Yeah.
11,15,Sam,Get this. Guy at the wake told me they’re only making 25 bucks tonight.
11,15,Dean,That’s it?
11,15,Sam,Yeah.
11,15,Dean,"Now, that hardly seems worth it. Yeah, think about that. Town after town, putting your ass on the line for next to nothing? No money. No glory. Wow."
11,15,Sam,You realize you just literally described our jobs.
11,15,Spectator,"Whoa. Excuse me, fellas."
11,15,Spectator,This is gonna be great.
11,15,Son,Yeah.
11,15,Sam,Yeah.
11,15,Dean,"You want to not try and ruin one of the nicest things Dad ever did for us, please? Thank you."
11,15,Rio,Ladies and gentlemen... put your hands together for Hellrazor!
11,15,Rio,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Gunnar Lawless!"
11,15,Dean,Yeah!
11,15,Gunnar,"Oh, yeah!"
11,15,Dean,"Oh, yeah!"
11,15,Gunnar,"Who’s getting it? Who’s getting it, huh?"
11,15,Dean,"Oh, oh, remember this? [He says excitedly to Sam] this is where he takes a glove off and gives it to some kid before the match. Whoo!"
11,15,Child,Cool.
11,15,Dean,Okay.
11,15,Sam [smirking],Maybe next time.
11,15,Dean,It’s all right. I’m not a child. It’s fine.
11,15,Rio [commentating],Big foot to the face!
11,15,Rio,Lawless up on the ropes now.
11,15,Sam,"Get up! Get up, buddy."
11,15,Dean,"Come on, man."
11,15,Sam,"You can do it, Gunnar. Get up, buddy."
11,15,Sam,Get out of it!
11,15,Dean,Up and over! Up and over!
11,15,Rio,"Oh, but it’s all over now, folks."
11,15,EXTERIOR,An ambulance is outside the venue.
11,15,Sam,"Hey, buddy, try to keep your head up, okay?"
11,15,Dean,Poor kid.
11,15,Sam,Yeah.
11,15,Dean,What’d they say?
11,15,Sam,You’re not gonna believe this. The body... was marked.
11,15,Dean,"Wow. By what? What, he get in a tickle fight with Edward Scissorhands?"
11,15,Sam,"Dude. Look. The cuts look deliberate, you know? Ritualistic."
11,15,Dean,"What, you think this is a case?"
11,15,Sam,You think it’s not?
11,15,Dean,Okay. What are you thinking?
11,15,Sam,"I don’t know. A witch, maybe? You know what? I’ll head back to the motel, look into the symbol."
11,15,Dean,"I’ll stay here, shake some trees."
11,15,Dean,Hello? FBI. I got some questions... [and then when no-one answers] Bueller?
11,15,Dean,Whoo!
11,15,Dean [yelling],Oh yeah!
11,15,Rio,Nice moves.
11,15,Rio,Are you all right?
11,15,Dean,"Yeah, good."
11,15,Rio,Oh.
11,15,Dean,"Uh... agent, uh, Roussimoff, FBI."
11,15,Rio,"You were at the wake, weren’t you?"
11,15,Dean,"I was. Yeah, and then the body dropped, and back on the clock. Did you know the deceased?"
11,15,Rio,"Oh, I... I sold him some tickets. He had a kid, right?"
11,15,Dean,Yeah.
11,15,Rio,Wow. Maybe my boys are right. Maybe we really are cursed.
11,15,Dean,Cursed?
11,15,Rio,"Back in Shreveport, our first stop on the tour, a maintenance guy found a body stashed in a dumpster behind the VFW, and now this."
11,15,Dean,"Could I get a list of your whole crew? Wrestlers, roadies, anybody that you roll with?"
11,15,Rio,"Oh, we use locals for all the setups and concessions. I can only afford to travel my boys."
11,15,Dean,And where would they be right now?
11,15,Rio,Try the nearest bar. I know that’s where I’ll be.
11,15,Dean,Okay. Thanks.
11,15,INTERIOR,"Inside Crowley’s lair, Crowley is back in a cage. The demon Simmons opens the door."
11,15,Simmons,We don’t have much time. I’m getting you out of here. Now.
11,15,Simmons,"You can. You still have friends... people who want you back... who want Lucifer gone. I don’t know what he’s done to you. I can’t imagine... but you’re... you’re not a slave, a dog. You’re Crowley, and the Devil should be afraid of you."
11,15,INTERIOR,Dean enters a bar. There is a girl dancing on the pool table and many of the wrestlers enjoying a drink. He sees Rio and she nods to him. He sees Harley pouring tequila into a girl’s mouth. Then he sees Gunnar Lawless and goes to sit with him at the bar.
11,15,Dean,Hey.
11,15,Gunnar,"Hey. [He gives Dean a drink.] Dean, right?"
11,15,Dean,Yeah.
11,15,Gunnar,You enjoy the show?
11,15,Dean,The show was great.
11,15,Gunnar,"Yeah, yeah."
11,15,Dean,"You were great. After the show, not so much, but, uh..."
11,15,Gunnar,"Yeah, I heard. It’s a damn shame."
11,15,Dean,Yeah.
11,15,Dean,"That’s, uh, kind of why I’m here. Uh..."
11,15,Gunnar,"Kind of buried the lead on that one, huh?"
11,15,Waitress,You’re welcome.
11,15,Gunnar,It’s a rough crowd... inside the ring and out.
11,15,Dean,Yeah.
11,15,Gunnar,"’92, I’m leaving the ring and some damn reprobate goes at me with a broken beer bottle."
11,15,Dean,"Wow. A couple of years ago, a, uh, perp got the drop on me, decided to take a chunk of my leg as a keepsake."
11,15,Dean,"Wow. But yet you’re still out there, still doing it."
11,15,Gunner,"I've been beat up, spit on, stabbed, roughed up. But I will be damned if I didn't always get back up. One thing I learned, you got to keep on grinding no matter what's thrown your way."
11,15,Dean,"Damn, you’re awesome."
11,15,Gunnar,Tell that to my ex-wives.
11,15,Sam,"A lot, actually. Uh, so every stop on the Top Notch tour, somebody turned up dead. It didn’t all happen at the venue, and most of them look like accidents, but they all had the symbol... Hangman, too."
11,15,Dean,"Well, I thought he killed himself."
11,15,Sam,"Yeah, that’s what Rio said, but the cops are treating it like an open case. They’re thinking, and I quote, “It’s some kind of weird satanic crap.”"
11,15,Dean,Awesome.
11,15,Sam,"Yeah, it gets better. That symbol... ancient Sumerian. Said to have the power to “pluck the spark of life.”"
11,15,Dean,And that means?
11,15,Sam,"Souls, maybe?"
11,15,Dean,So we’re talking demon?
11,15,Sam,It’s worth checking out.
11,15,Dean,"Well, Rio says that they use locals to set up, so..."
11,15,Sam,So it’s got to be one of the wrestlers.
11,15,Dean,Maybe. All right. Just get here.
11,15,Sam,What are you gonna do?
11,15,Dean,I’m working on it.
11,15,Gunnar,"Hey, Harley, go easy. I think you’ve had enough."
11,15,Harley,Screw off.
11,15,Gunnar,Just trying to help.
11,15,Harley,Like you helped me in Fort Worth?
11,15,Harley,What? You think I don’t know you got me kicked off the card?
11,15,Gunnar,"You wouldn’t job to Crazy D, and I couldn’t abide by that."
11,15,Harley,"Yeah, I think you just can’t stand the thought of me stealing your thunder."
11,15,Gunnar,"Kid, I got no worries about that."
11,15,Rio,All right. That’s enough.
11,15,Harley,"Get up, old man. Or do you need your go-juice?"
11,15,Rio,What?
11,15,Harley,That’s right. I saw him and his dealer. Your golden boy’s a freaking junkie.
11,15,Gunnar,He’s lying.
11,15,Harley,Like hell.
11,15,Rio,"All right, all right. Harley, we got two days till Memphis. Sleep it off. Gunnar, I’ll talk to you about this tomorrow. [Rio pushes Harley.] Go."
11,15,Dean,Hey.
11,15,Gunnar,Hey.
11,15,Dean,You okay?
11,15,Gunnar,"Ah, yeah, yeah. I’ve been hit harder by guys a lot tougher."
11,15,Dean,"Yeah. Why, uh... why didn’t you fight back?"
11,15,Gunnar,I got nothing to prove.
11,15,Dean,Yeah.
11,15,Wrestler,"You okay, boss?"
11,15,Gunnar,"Yeah. Just another day, huh?"
11,15,Dean,"Well, hey. Here’s, uh... here’s to being the bigger man, right?"
11,15,Gunnar,Obliged.
11,15,Dean,We’re gonna need more shots. A lot more.
11,15,INTERIOR,"In Crowley’s lair, Simmons is leading Crowley to the door."
11,15,Simmons,This way.
11,15,Simmons,How did you...
11,15,Crowley,I’m Crowley.
11,15,INTERIOR,"Back at the bar, Sam has just wandered in and he looks for Dean. The waitress is closing up and everyone is gone, except for Dean who is lying on one of the benches. He groans."
11,15,Sam,Dean? Dean. Hey!
11,15,Sam,"Dude, you okay?"
11,15,Dean,Yeah. Ah.
11,15,Sam,What happened?
11,15,Sam,"So, did anyone react?"
11,15,Dean,No.
11,15,Sam,And you got them all?
11,15,Dean [squinting],"Uh, except, uh, Harley, the ultimate douchebag. He bailed before I could get to him. Why is it so bright in here?"
11,15,Sam [unsympathetically],All right. Let’s go find him.
11,15,Dean,Okay.
11,15,Sam,Dude!
11,15,Dean,I’m coming.
11,15,EXTERIOR,"Sam and Dean are in the impala, driving into a motel driveway. They pull up and knock on the door of one of the motel rooms."
11,15,Dean [yelling],Harley. Harley.
11,15,Dean,"Well, that’s not good."
11,15,Sam,"Uh, ya think?"
11,15,EXTERIOR,"Crowley walks down a dark laneway. He adjusts his watch. He looks comfortable and cocky, wearing his usual black suit and tie. He joins Simmons."
11,15,Simmons,My Lord?
11,15,Crowley,That’s better. Now let’s go find the ace up my sleeve.
11,15,INTERIOR,"Back in Harley’s motel room, Dean is checking for EMF and Sam is looking at an i-Pad."
11,15,Sam,"Hey, check this out. Come here."
11,15,Dean,Got something?
11,15,Sam,"Yeah, uh, security-cam footage. All right, let’s see if we got anything. Um, so this is 1.07 am. Harley heads to his room. Um..."
11,15,Dean,Who’s...
11,15,Sam,"No idea. But, in there for a few minutes, and that’s Harley."
11,15,Dean,Wow. He looks knocked out.
11,15,Sam,"Yeah. Now, let’s see."
11,15,Dean,Lawless?
11,15,Sam,"If Harley is a demon, then how did Gunnar get the drop on him?"
11,15,Dean,Let’s find him and ask him.
11,15,INTERIOR,Harley is bound to a chair. There is canvas covering the floor of the small dark room. His face is bloody and he struggles against his bindings.
11,15,Harley [yelling],Hey! Help!
11,15,Harley,"Dude, what the hell is going on? Look. I know I’ve been a dick, but I’m sorry, okay? I took a shot at you. It was a cheap shot. It was... it was a cheap-ass shot. And I just... just don’t hurt me. Please."
11,15,Gunnar,It’s not my call.
11,15,Duke,"Hello, Shawn. [Duke’s eyes flash red, revealing that he is a demon]. I’m your new best friend."
11,15,INTERIOR,Back in Harley’s motel room.
11,15,Sam,"Okay, traffic cameras show the truck heading north on Wilson, past First and Second, but it never got to Third. Wait a second. That’s... that’s by the..."
11,15,Dean,Yeah.
11,15,EXTERIOR,The white van is parked outside Trenton Hall where the wrestling took place.
11,15,INTERIOR,Harley is still bound to the chair.
11,15,Harley,You want my what?
11,15,Duke,"Forget what I want. What do you want? Money? Women? Glory? A big, shiny belt? Say the word, and it’s yours."
11,15,Harley,Because you’re a demon?
11,15,Duke,Businessman.
11,15,Harley,"Dude, what the hell is..."
11,15,Duke,"Eyes on me, champ. Think about it. No more crappy motels, Podunk towns. You’ll have the life you always wanted... gumdrops and G-strings as far as the eye can see. And all I ask in return is..."
11,15,Harley,My soul.
11,15,Duke,"And your service. See, I might occasionally ask you to do me a teeny, tiny, little favor."
11,15,Harley,What kind of favor?
11,15,Duke,The kill-somebody kind.
11,15,Harley,Why me?
11,15,Duke,Because I like you. You’re brash and driven and hungry. I’m looking for new franchisees. Why have one when I can have two?
11,15,Harley,You did this?
11,15,Duke,Gunnar’s what I like to call a satisfied customer. So... do we have a deal?
11,15,Harley,"No. Look, man. I’ve never been much for God or whatever. I sort of just thought that when your curtain came down, that was it. Night, night. But if you’re a demon, that means there’s a Hell. And if there’s a Hell, there is a Heaven. And I’m not giving up my shot at paradise for a belt I can win on my own."
11,15,Duke,That so?
11,15,Duke,"You’re talented, Shawn. But the human body it’s just so fragile. One injury, one wrong step... like, say, if somebody severed your Achilles tendon. Poof... you’re done."
11,15,Gunnar,"Duke, no."
11,15,Gunnar,He’s just a kid.
11,15,Duke,Do it.
11,15,INTERIOR,Crowley and Simmons are standing at the entrance to a storage lockup.
11,15,Simmons,What is this?
11,15,Crowley,"My personal lockup... keepsakes, mementos, things I’d prefer the rabble not to get their grubby hands on."
11,15,Simmons,Is that you?
11,15,Crowley,"Oh, the good old days."
11,15,Simmons,Why are we here?
11,15,Crowley,"For this. The Rod of Aaron... created by God on the sixth day and given to Aaron, brother of Moses. I knew it was powerful but had no idea that it was a..."
11,15,Simmons,A Hand of God. Can I touch it?
11,15,Crowley,"With all due respect, Simmons, I don't think you can handle my rod."
11,15,Lucifer,I bet I can.
11,15,Lucifer [smirking],Is it just me or is it getting a little phallic in here?
11,15,EXTERIOR,"Sam and Dean arrive at Trenton Hall. They pull up the impala beside the white van, and then enter the hall with their guns drawn. Gunnar is standing over Harley’s bloody body, knife still in hand."
11,15,Dean,Drop it.
11,15,Duke,Isn’t this a fun surprise?
11,15,INTERIOR,Crowley’s lockup.
11,15,Lucifer [mocking],You really thought you could double-cross me? Me?
11,15,Lucifer,"You know I invented the double-cross. Like literally. Of course, I couldn’t have orchestrated all of this without the lovely, talented Simmons here."
11,15,Lucifer,"She, um, she hates you, B-T-Dubs."
11,15,Simmons,Yeah. I really do.
11,15,Lucifer,"Yeah, they all do. Like, every demon in Hell. Can’t really blame them, can you? I mean, maybe once you were the evilest evil that ever eviled... present company excluded. But now... you’re nothing but Dean Winchester’s number-one fan."
11,15,INTERIOR,Trenton Hall.
11,15,Duke,"Sam and Dean. I got to admit... after all the stories, I thought you’d be more."
11,15,Dean,"Well, sorry to disappoint."
11,15,Duke,"It’s my fault. You get your hopes up. You want an L.A. 10, but you settle for a Kansas 5. Life, right? The name’s..."
11,15,Sam,We don’t care.
11,15,Duke,Okay. Small talk over. [He looks at Gunnar]. Kill them.
11,15,Dean,"Gunnar, Gunnar, no. Wait."
11,15,Sam,Dean!
11,15,INTERIOR,Crowley’s lockup.
11,15,Lucifer,"I knew you were hiding something. I could see that last spark of defiance in your eyes. [Lucifer grabs hold of Crowley’s jacket, pulling him closer]. And rather than beating it out of you, which... doable, but messy... I let you lead me here. [He pushes Crowley out of the way]. So I’m gonna take this... [Lucifer taps the box and turns to face Crowley]... and then I’m gonna take you. And, oh, puppy, you’re not gonna like what comes next."
11,15,Crowley,You looking for this?
11,15,Crowley,"you really think you could double-cross me? Me?! I perfected the double-cross. Like, literally."
11,15,Crowley,"So this is what it feels like to be God. Not bad. Tingly. So, if this can hurt something as powerful as the Darkness, I wonder... what can it do to you?"
11,15,INTERIOR,Trenton Hall. Gunnar is tying Dean to a chair.
11,15,Gunnar,"Sorry, kid. I don’t want to do this."
11,15,Dean,"Oh, then don’t."
11,15,Gunnar,"You say that like I got a choice. That guy out there, he’s a..."
11,15,Dean,"He’s a demon. I know. And I know about Hell and deals... all of it. What’s he got over you? You sold your soul, didn’t you?"
11,15,Gunnar,"Ten years ago, I wanted another shot at the belt; 50,000 people screaming my name. I was desperate and dumb."
11,15,Dean,But you only had the title for like a week.
11,15,Gunnar,Desperate and dumb.
11,15,Dean,"Okay. Okay. Look, you screwed up, all right? Trust me. I’ve been there. But it is never too late to do the right thing."
11,15,Gunnar,You really believe that?
11,15,Dean,I have to.
11,15,INTERIOR,Crowley’s lockup.
11,15,Lucifer,"You made me bleed my own blood. [He walks towards Crowley]. You’re out of juice, huh?"
11,15,Crowley,Bollocks.
11,15,INTERIOR,Trenton Hall. Duke still has Sam pinned against the wall.
11,15,Sam,Does Crowley know you’re doing this?
11,15,Duke,"Crowley’s Lucifer’s bitch boy, which is why I’m doing this."
11,15,Sam,Stealing souls?
11,15,Duke,"Building a nest egg. With the Darkness out and the Devil running Hell, well it's kind of every demon for him/her/shimself."
11,15,Sam,So why do you need Lawless?
11,15,Duke,"Well, I can’t be everywhere. When the g-man’s deal came due, I gave him a choice... end up hellhound chow or collect souls for me. I’m delegating. That’s what good managers do."
11,15,Dean,Hey!
11,15,Duke,"Hey, yourself, handsome."
11,15,Duke,"Now, this... this is my favorite part."
11,15,Sam,Dean. Hey. [He helps Dean up]. Dean. Hey. You all right?
11,15,Dean,"Yeah, I’m good. I’m good."
11,15,Sam,What?
11,15,Dean,Hellhounds.
11,15,Gunnar,I always wondered what they’d sound like.
11,15,Dean,"Listen, man. You, uh..."
11,15,Gunnar,No. I’ve never been a good man. I look in the mirror and I hate the face looking back at me.
11,15,Gunnar,"No, I, uh... I got this coming."
11,15,Gunnar,Go on. Get out. Now!
11,15,INTERIOR,Sam and Dean come down the stairs into the Bunker.
11,15,Sam,Are you okay?
11,15,Dean,"Not even a little bit. Lawless was a good guy. He didn’t deserve to go out like that, you know?"
11,15,Sam,"Dean, you know what? He made a bad decision. We’ve been there."
11,15,Dean,"Yeah, you, me, now Cas."
11,15,Sam,"Dean, we’ll get him back. We will. We just got to..."
11,15,Dean,"Keep grinding. No matter how much it hurts, no matter how hard it gets, you got to keep grinding."
11,15,Sam,Right.
11,15,Dean,"And that’s how we’re gonna win. And we’re gonna win. We’re gonna save Cas, we’re gonna ice the Devil and we’re gonna shank the Darkness. And anyone that gets in our way, well, God help them."
11,15,Sam,Damn right.
11,15,Dean,Damn right.
11,17,INTERIOR,"Inside the cabin, a body slams heavily into a table, smashing it to pieces. It is Sam. A man stands above him, growling, baring his teeth; a werewolf. Sam aims his gun, but the werewolf kicks it out of his hand and then tries to slam his boot on Sam’s chest. Just in time, Sam rolls out of harm’s way."
11,17,EXTERIOR,"There’s a cabin in the woods. We hear insects, an owl hooting, and other gentle sounds of nature."
11,17,INTERIOR,"Inside the cabin, a body slams heavily into a table, smashing it to pieces. It is Sam. A man stands above him, growling, baring his teeth; a werewolf. Sam aims his gun, but the werewolf kicks it out of his hand and then tries to slam his boot on Sam’s chest. Just in time, Sam rolls out of harm’s way."
11,17,Sam,How’s it going over there?
11,17,Dean,Same.
11,17,Sam,Hmm.
11,17,Dean,"And you, anything?"
11,17,Sam,"Yeah, I... I think so."
11,17,Dean,"Yeah? On Amara, Lucifer, Hand of God?"
11,17,Sam,"No, no, it's a... it's a case. Werewolves, looks like. [Sam reads from an article on his laptop.] Um... a pattern of missing campers... five in the last three months."
11,17,Dean [frustrated],So they got lost.
11,17,Sam,"Well, that's what the rangers thought, too, until a couple days ago, when they found a body..."
11,17,Dean,Let me guess... minus a heart?
11,17,Sam,"Yeah. Now, they're calling it an animal attack, but..."
11,17,Dean,"All right, well, we make a call and we put somebody on it."
11,17,Sam,"Yeah, but... [He sighs, closes his laptop and looks at Dean]. We'll get him back."
11,17,Dean,How?
11,17,Sam,"I... I don't know. But we'll figure it out. Meantime, we got to get out of here. Clear our heads. I mean, this is a case. Let's do what we do. Let's work it."
11,17,Corbin,"Baby, you still with me?"
11,17,Dean,"Okay, okay. All right. Almost got it. Almost got it."
11,17,Dean,"Right there. Come on, come on! Okay, there we go. There we go. Look at that, huh? Hey!"
11,17,Dean,"Well, you know what? We got to keep that one. That one's gonna be a little memento. We'll laugh about it some other time."
11,17,Corbin,Guys? She ain't doing so good.
11,17,Dean,Here.
11,17,Sam,Thanks.
11,17,Corbin,"The one he killed, he's got the key."
11,17,Dean,Good. Okay.
11,17,Michelle,W-What were they?
11,17,Dean,Werewolves.
11,17,Michelle,Told you they were monsters.
11,17,Corbin,"That's right, baby. You called it."
11,17,Michelle,"I thought werewolves needed night time, a full moon?"
11,17,Michelle,"We've been here for days. These guys, they can change any time."
11,17,Corbin,Okay.
11,17,Dean,"How we doing? How we doing, huh? You good, you good?"
11,17,Sam [panting],Yeah.
11,17,Dean,"All right, keep pressure on it. Keep pressure."
11,17,Corbin,You don't have a cell phone?
11,17,Sam,"Yeah, no, I know."
11,17,Dean,Okay.
11,17,Michelle,Are you okay? I thought yesterday...
11,17,Corbin,Just a couple scratches.
11,17,Corbin,"Hey, we're coming!"
11,17,Dean,"No, no, no, no, no."
11,17,Corbin,"Oh, no, we can't stay here, not with the others still out there."
11,17,Sam,Others?
11,17,Dean,"Okay, listen, my brother's been shot. He can't stay here alone."
11,17,Dean,"Sam, hey."
11,17,Sam,I'm fine.
11,17,Sam,Whew!
11,17,INTERIOR,Sam and Dean are talking to the waitress.
11,17,Rose,"You know, I used to be good with faces, but it's my age and the number of folks that come through this place. I seem to have lost the knack, so... These days, everybody under 40 looks the same to me. I'm sorry."
11,17,Sam,"All right, look... we know we're in the right place. We've tried all the big landmarks outside of the park... the police station, the... the... the fleabag motel we're staying in, this bar."
11,17,Dean,"Yeah, well, we're running out of things to interrogate, unless you want to go outside, start talking to the trees."
11,17,Sam,"Right. All right, let's call it a night."
11,17,Dean,Right. [to the waitress] Grab the check?
11,17,Sam,"You know, we can go to Park Services in the morning, talk to the rangers."
11,17,Rose,"You know what I was thinking? You boys should check out one of the easement cabins. It's private property within the park. It's just held onto for tax purposes, so campers stumble on them and they can hole up in there for weeks. Some of your missing could be in one of them."
11,17,Sam,"Do you mind, um, showing us about where they are?"
11,17,Rose,"Oh, yeah, sure. Right about there [she points to the location on Sam’s map]."
11,17,Sam,"Well, that is a big help. That's great. Thank you."
11,17,Rose,No problem.
11,17,Dean,Thanks.
11,17,Dean [concerned],"Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on. Okay."
11,17,Dean,Yeah.
11,17,Corbin,"Guys, over here."
11,17,Dean,"Hey, look at that."
11,17,INTERIOR,"Dean opens the door to the cabin and shines flashlight inside, making sure it is empty. He reaches out to Sam, helping him stumble inside. Corbin and Michelle follow."
11,17,Dean,"Okay. All right, see if you can find a... a radio or a phone."
11,17,Sam,Anything?
11,17,Dean,"No, it's dead."
11,17,Dean,I got matches over here. I'm gonna light those up.
11,17,Sam,Yeah.
11,17,Corbin,"I... look. Hey, Michelle's real sick, but she's got a chance. Him... he's slowing us down. And if they find us..."
11,17,Dean,"We saved you, okay? We saved both of you."
11,17,Corbin,It's three lives versus one.
11,17,Corbin,Whoa... hey!
11,17,Sam,"Dean, stop! Dean... he's right. You guys need to... to go. Move. Go find help, come back for me."
11,17,Dean [angrily],"No, Sam! No! I'm gonna go outside, I'm gonna find some wood, gonna build you a litter, and [to Corbin] we are going to carry him the rest of the way."
11,17,Dean [desperately],It's only a couple of miles.
11,17,INTERIOR,The waitress Rose and the big man from the bar are now in the other cabin. They are the other werewolves that Corbin talked about. They survey the damage.
11,17,Werewolf,Now what?
11,17,Rose,Well... we're burned here. So clean up their mess and we'll get gone.
11,17,EXTERIOR,"Dean is collecting branches to make a litter for Sam. He works by torchlight, urgently piling up the wood. His jacket gets caught on a tree and he swings wildly at it; hitting the tree with another branch."
11,17,Dean,Get off me!
11,17,Dean,Okay. Okay. Okay. [He continues to work.]
11,17,INTERIOR,"Sam is sitting on the floor, leaning against the counter. He is in so much pain, clutching his stomach and groaning. Perspiration covers his face. He coughs weakly."
11,17,Sam [scared],Guys? Guys? Go find Dean. Get out of here.
11,17,Sam,"Hey, please. Go. You got to go."
11,17,Corbin,He won't leave you. And we won't last out there without him.
11,17,Sam [uncertainly],"Wait, what?"
11,17,Corbin,I'm sorry.
11,17,Corbin,Dead.
11,17,Dean,We got to go. [He sees Sam lying motionless on the floor.] Sam? Sammy?
11,17,Dean,What happened?
11,17,Corbin,I... I... I don't know. He just went.
11,17,Dean,No. Sammy?
11,17,Dean [softly],Sammy
11,17,Michelle,"No, no, no."
11,17,Michelle,No. What?
11,17,Corbin,He wants to stay.
11,17,Michelle [desperately],"No, you can't!"
11,17,Corbin,"Hey, hey, you stay, you fight, you die. And so do we. Look...he's gone. I'm sorry, but he's gone. Help us. Please."
11,17,Sam,"All right, so, I think if we head in that way, should be about a four-mile trek to the cabin. You know, we always talk about taking a break, going camping. This could be like camping. It could be fun."
11,17,Dean [grumpy],"Yeah, which part? Hmm? Freezing our nuts off in the middle of the woods on a thin lead?"
11,17,Sam [laughing],"Yeah, that part. Oh, come on."
11,17,Dean [sighing],Okay.
11,17,Michelle,Talk to me.
11,17,Corbin,"I saved us. Look, you're hurt bad and... and I love you, Michelle. I can't lose you. I did what I had to do."
11,17,Dean [yelling],"Oh, whoa, whoa. Hey! Hey! Wait!"
11,17,Dean [yelling],"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Right here, right here! Okay. [He turns to Corbin and Michelle.] Come on, guys. Okay, here we go."
11,17,Dean,She needs medical attention right away.
11,17,Sheriff,"Hey, hold up."
11,17,Dean,"No, no, just take care of them. I got to get back to my car, back to my brother."
11,17,Sheriff,"Hey, first, everyone is gonna settle down and tell me what the hell is going on."
11,17,Dean,"Officer, I don't have the time."
11,17,Sheriff,"Hey, hey, hey! You'll make time."
11,17,Dr Kessler,Don't try to move if you can help it. You got a couple broken ribs I haven't tended to yet. That... and what is probably... [she flashes a light into his eyes] a nasty concussion.
11,17,Dr Kessler,"Hey, do us both a favor. Get some rest."
11,17,Dean,Mm.
11,17,Corbin,"Then his brother... his brother just died. [Michelle looks at him sadly.] And we ran. The bad guys, they're still out there."
11,17,Michelle [angry],Monsters. Werewolves.
11,17,Corbin,We don't know what their deal was. Only what that guy told us.
11,17,Michelle,"“That guy” saved us, and so did his brother."
11,17,Corbin,Michelle... we made it.
11,17,Dr Kessler,"Okay, your wife is stable now. Time for me to get a look at you."
11,17,Corbin,I'm fine.
11,17,Dr Kessler,I'll be the judge.
11,17,Corbin,"No. Really, I'm... I'm good."
11,17,Dr Kessler,What did this? [She starts to clean the wound.] How do you feel?
11,17,Corbin,"I feel, uh... good."
11,17,Sheriff,"Come on, Charlie, pick up. Come on."
11,17,Michelle [smiling],Hi.
11,17,Dean,Hey.
11,17,Dean,Sure.
11,17,Michelle,"I... I just wanted to see how you were doing. And to tell you th... [Her voice shakes with emotion and she pauses.] I'm sorry. You saved our lives and... [another pause] well, my mom used to say, um... I didn't believe her then, but I... I think I do now. She used to say... death... it's not the end."
11,17,Michelle,Dean?
11,17,Michelle,What are you doing?
11,17,Dean,"I need to... I need to talk to a... well, I wouldn't call it a friend, more like a... scary, crazy death machine. Werewolves aren't the only monsters out there."
11,17,Michelle,"How exactly do you talk to an evil, scary death machine?"
11,17,Dean,Easy. I die.
11,17,Michelle,What?
11,17,Dean,"Look, if you don't... If you want to leave, I get it. But if you want to help me... I'm looking for pretty much anything with “barbital” in the name."
11,17,Michelle,Yeah. This will work?
11,17,Dean,It has to.
11,17,INTERIOR [cabin],"The camera pans slowly up Sam’s motionless body. There is blood all over him. Suddenly, Sam opens his eyes and gasps loudly, sucking oxygen into his lungs. He coughs and groans, and looks around the room."
11,17,INTERIOR [hospital],Dean spills two types of pills onto the table. He shovels a pile of them into his hand and turns to look at Michelle.
11,17,Dean,"Okay. After I do this, go get the doc and tell her to, um... Tell her to bring me back, if she can. If not... no hard feelings, okay?"
11,17,Dean,"Yeah, I do."
11,17,INTERIOR [cabin],"Sam groans as he touches the wound in his stomach and sees how much blood he has lost. His head falls back to the ground, gasping with pain. He pants, steeling himself to sit up. It’s a monumental effort to reach the counter and pull himself up to his feet. He leans against the counter and looks around the room."
11,17,Sam,Dean?
11,17,EXTERIOR,The truck pulls up outside the cabin. Rose and the other werewolf get out and approach the cabin.
11,17,Rose,Go around that side.
11,17,INTERIOR [hospital],Dean is waiting for the pills to take effect.
11,17,Michelle,How do you feel?
11,17,Michelle,Dean?
11,17,INTERIOR [cabin],Sam is stumbling down stairs into the basement.
11,17,INTERIOR [hospital],Dean collapses.
11,17,INTERIOR [cabin],"Sam falls heavily down the stairs, crying out in pain."
11,17,INTERIOR [hospital],Dean is on the floor and Michelle bends down to check on him.
11,17,Michelle,Dean! Oh! Dean?
11,17,Michelle,It's in here.
11,17,Dr Kessler,"Damn it. Uh, grab me naloxone. It's the little bottle, middle shelf, and a bag of saline. We need to run a line. Damn it."
11,17,INTERIOR [cabin],"The werewolf kicks the door down, walking slowly into the cabin. He looks cautiously around the room. In the basement, Sam stumbles and almost falls, and then he hears the floorboards creaking above. He looks up as dust falls from the ceiling onto his face. The werewolf sniffs the air, and looks towards the basement door. He walks in that direction, and Sam, hearing the footsteps, looks frantically around for somewhere to hide. The werewolf pushes open the door, the hinges squeaking."
11,17,INTERIOR [hospital],"Dean thrashes violently on the floor, making gurgling noises as the froth continues to leak from his mouth. Dr Kessler and Michelle are struggling to hold him still."
11,17,Sheriff,Holy hell.
11,17,Dr Kessler,Help us!
11,17,Dr Kessler,No. Roll him over.
11,17,Michelle,I got him.
11,17,Dean’s spirit,"Well, it took you long enough."
11,17,Billie,Dean Winchester.
11,17,Dean’s spirit,What's with the freeze-frame?
11,17,Billie,"Just savoring this. Though I have to say of all the ways I thought you'd go... heart attack, some fang, choking on a burger while binge-watching “Charles in Charge”..."
11,17,Dean’s spirit,"Well, that was peak Baio."
11,17,Billie,"Point is, never took you for the suicide type. Doesn't fit your whole martyr thing. So... 'sup?"
11,17,Dean’s spirit,We need to talk about Sam.
11,17,Billie,What about Sam?
11,17,Dean’s spirit,I need him back.
11,17,Billie,Back?
11,17,Dean’s spirit,"Stop playing. Look, you've got him, I need him. Let's make a deal."
11,17,Billie,Pass [she turns to leave].
11,17,Dean’s spirit,Really? Just like that?
11,17,Billie,Just like that.
11,17,Dean’s spirit,"You know, the Darkness is out there... and the world is gonna burn. And once she gets started, that's the end of everything, including you. Now, Sam's the only one who can stop it."
11,17,Billie,Hmm. How's that?
11,17,Billie,"That's what I thought. It's cute, though. You pretending you're trying to save Sam for the greater good, when we both know you're doing it for you. You can't lose him. But even if Sammy could win the title bout... the answer would still be “no.” The answer will always be “no.” Game's over, Dean. No more second chances. No more extra lives. Time to say bye-bye to Luigi, Mario."
11,17,Billie,"I'm not here to bargain with you, kid. I'm here to reap you. And the kicker is... Sam's not dead. [Dean looks stunned] But you are. Or will be, soon enough."
11,17,Dr Kessler,Pulse is fading. Throw me that cardio tray.
11,17,Billie,"Trust me. If the big “W” bit it, I'd get a call. [The realisation that Sam is alive crosses Dean’s face, and he looks at Billie’s outstretched hand.] Come along now, Dean. It's time. The empty... it's waiting."
11,17,Dr Kessler,Turn him on his side.
11,17,Sheriff,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay."
11,17,INTERIOR [cabin],"The werewolf makes his way slowly down the stairs into the basement, the thud of each footstep loud. He sees the pool of Sam’s blood at the foot of the stairs and stops to smell it. He walks slowly through the basement, looking carefully for any sign of Sam."
11,17,INTERIOR [hospital],"Dr Kessler and Michelle help Dean to his feet, while the Sheriff looks on."
11,17,Michelle,"He? Sam? Oh, thank God."
11,17,Dean,"Yeah, not so much. I need a... I need a car."
11,17,Sheriff,"No. No, not a chance."
11,17,Dean,"Look, pal, I'm not asking."
11,17,Dr Kessler,No.
11,17,Sheriff,"Can we have a word outside, please?"
11,17,Dr Kessler,More drugs is the last thing he needs. He could die... again.
11,17,Sheriff,"Fine, just keep your eye on him. I'm gonna call over to White Bird, get some backup in here."
11,17,Dean,Sammy?
11,17,Sam,"Dean, yeah."
11,17,Sam,Where are you?
11,17,Dean,"I'm, uh, at the Urgent Care on 54."
11,17,Dean,Sammy?
11,17,Sam,Is Corbin with you?
11,17,Dean,Sam?!
11,17,Sam,Dean!
11,17,INTERIOR [hospital],Dr Kessler is walking down the corridor and she hears a man yelling and groaning. She knocks on the door.
11,17,Dr Kessler,Hello? You okay?
11,17,Corbin,I really am.
11,17,Michelle,Are you okay?
11,17,Michelle,I don't know.
11,17,Michelle,Corbin?
11,17,Corbin,"Hey, baby. Please, don't be scared of me. I didn't want this. Okay, any of this, but... it's happened and it feels so... you'll see. [Michelle whimpers.] We'll be together."
11,17,Michelle,No. Please.
11,17,Corbin,Forever.
11,17,Michelle,No!
11,17,Michelle [screaming],No! No!
11,17,Dean,It took you long enough.
11,17,Dean,Hey.
11,17,Michelle,Hey.
11,17,Dean,How you doing?
11,17,Michelle,How's your brother?
11,17,Dean,"The doc says that, um... well, when Corbin choked him, um, Sam's body went into shock and his breathing, his heartbeat slowed down to almost nothing. So he was, uh... he was just mostly dead. But he'll be okay."
11,17,Michelle,Must be nice. That wasn't... Corbin wasn't a killer.
11,17,Dean,I know.
11,17,Michelle,He did it for me.
11,17,Dean,"Michelle, this is gonna be very hard. But you will be okay. And, eventually... eventually you'll get back to normal."
11,17,Michelle [sighing],"No, I won't."
11,17,Michelle,They said I could leave... [she sighs] an hour ago. But... where am I even supposed to go? After everything we survived together... [turning back to Dean] I watched the man I love die. There's no normal after that.
11,17,EXTERIOR,Sam and Dean leave the hospital.
11,17,Dean,"So, that's it, huh? Two quarts O-neg, and you're good to go."
11,17,Dean,She's strong. She'll be all right. Those stitches gonna hold?
11,17,Sam,"Oh, yeah... uh, professional grade. Couple days of antibiotics and some bed rest, and I'm, uh, back to normal."
11,17,Sam,"Hey, so, what did you do? When you thought I was dead? What did you do?"
11,17,Dean,"Thought about redecorating your room [Sam chuckles], you know, putting in a Jacuzzi, a nice disco ball... really class up the joint."
11,17,Sam,"Right, seriously."
11,17,Dean,"What, I, uh... I knew you weren't dead."
11,17,Sam,Right.
11,17,Dean,I knew.
11,18,EXTERIOR,Aerial view of a tent in the desert. It is surrounded by torch flames.
11,18,INTERIOR,"A man in white robes enters the tent, joining three other men who are conversing in Arabic. They sit for a drink, but then the tent begins to shake as the wind gusts outside. Crowley arrives."
11,18,Crowley,"Noel, I came when you asked. You're looking a trifle peaky. [Noel chuckles weakly.] Do you truly have it?"
11,18,Noel,And it's yours... if you hold up your end of the bargain.
11,18,Noel,I've had a good life... thanks to you. Very few of the world's secrets I haven't cracked. It seemed worth a soul... at the time.
11,18,Crowley,Oh. It always does.
11,18,Noel,Destroy that thing.
11,18,Crowley,Show me the object first.
11,18,Noel,"A shofar. The Horn of Joshua, touched by the hand of God. [Crowley reaches to take it.] Easy. Easy there."
11,18,Crowley,It's authentic. I can feel it.
11,18,Noel,Now tear that thing up.
11,18,Noel,Thank God. I don't think I have long.
11,18,Crowley,How very prescient of you.
11,18,Crowley,Amateurs.
11,18,EXTERIOR,Crowley is walking down a dark city street. Torrential rain is falling.
11,18,INTERIOR,In the bunker.
11,18,Crowley,"Honestly, you cynicism is depressing."
11,18,Crowley,Why would Lucifer force me to discuss the very means of his destruction?
11,18,Dean,What are you talking about?
11,18,Crowley,A weapon... one that channels divinity.
11,18,Crowley [sighing],"Yes, powerful enough to help destroy a force like the Darkness, [Crowley teleports to the top of a building site as he continues the conversation], or Lucifer. Tell me you haven't been searching for such a thing."
11,18,Dean,A Hand of God? Of course we have.
11,18,Crowley,Thought as much. St. Louis. The old post office on Beekman.
11,18,Dean,Crowley. [His cell phone beeps as connection is gone.] Sam!
11,18,INTERIOR,Inside an abandoned warehouse. Amara is lying on a table.
11,18,Amara [weakly],"How do I know that any of this is working? I don't feel any different, for all of your promises. I warn you, I'm not one to be trifled with."
11,18,Amara,And who are you again?
11,18,Rowena,"One who communes with the natural forces and channels them to help the less fortunate, such as yourself."
11,18,Amara,Really?
11,18,Rowena,Mm-hmm.
11,18,Amara,You're his mother.
11,18,Rowena,"Say what, dear?"
11,18,Amara,Uncle Crowley's mother.
11,18,Rowena [surprised],Uncle?
11,18,Amara,He tried controlling me when I was a child. Did he send you to bring me back?
11,18,Rowena,"Heavens, no. My son and I loathe each other."
11,18,Amara,Then why are you helping me?
11,18,Rowena,"Because you're going to win, my dear. Yes, I know about the grievance between you and your brother and his archangel. I have my own axe to grind with Lucifer."
11,18,Amara,You know him?
11,18,Rowena [scoffs],Know him?
11,18,Flashback,We see Lucifer snapping Rowena’s neck.
11,18,Amara,"And yet, you live?"
11,18,Rowena,"Aye. Like yourself, I'm a survivor. A hard life has taught me to be prepared. I, long ago, secreted within my person...(Rowena reveals a scar on her right thigh.) ...a wee casket of powerful magic."
11,18,Flashback,"We see Lucifer and Crowley leave the room, with Rowena dead on the floor. A spell is activated from her right thigh."
11,18,Rowena,When the spell inside me sensed my life-force ebbing... it went to work. (The spell reaches her heart and the energy travels throughout her body.) And I was revived.
11,18,Flashback,"We see Rowena waking up, gasping. Her neck forces itself back into place and she heals. Rowena looks furious."
11,18,Amara,"Where is Lucifer now? He's hidden himself from me, and I, too, have a score to settle."
11,18,Rowena,"All in good time. Right now, you're still weak from that pesky angel smiting."
11,18,Amara,And you can fix that?
11,18,Rowena,"Aye, and so much more. You can destroy your enemies and, I imagine, remake the world any way you choose. And I... will be by your side."
11,18,INTERIOR,"Dean and Sam enter another abandoned warehouse. There are cobwebs everywhere, so thick that Sam gets tangled and has to shake the cobwebs off. Crowley is waiting inside."
11,18,Dean,Nice digs. The Crypt Keeper out of town?
11,18,Crowley,I'm lucky to be alive. Lucifer had me trussed up like a dog in my own palace.
11,18,Dean,"""Palace""? Oh, you mean the abandoned nuthouse."
11,18,Crowley,"He kept me in a kennel! [Dean and Sam both smile, amused.] And he turned all his demons... my demons... against me. They scour the earth, day and night, looking to kill me. He has to be dealt with."
11,18,Dean,So is this why you brought us here? Some lousy grudge match with Lucifer?
11,18,Sam,"Yeah, where's this, uh, Hand of God you were talking about?"
11,18,Crowley,I'm getting to that. Your only hope of subduing Amara is to match the level of power that she possesses.
11,18,Dean,No kidding. And?
11,18,Crowley,And I have the Horn of Joshua.
11,18,Sam,Joshua? As in the Joshua that won the battle of Jericho?
11,18,Crowley,"And I'm willing to entrust it to your capable hands. [Sam and Dean look at each other, both sceptical.] What? I just said I'd give you the thing."
11,18,Crowley,"Is this how you say ""thank you""? You think these things grow on bloody trees?!"
11,18,Dean,"Cut the crap, Crowley. With you, there's always an ""if""."
11,18,Crowley,"Fine. I will give you the Horn ""if"" you help me exorcise Lucifer from Castiel's vessel and then return him immediately to the Cage."
11,18,Sam,"Oh, that's all? Huh."
11,18,Dean,Okay. And where is this horn?
11,18,Crowley,"Safely hidden, naturally."
11,18,Dean,Yeah.
11,18,Sam,"Crowley, even if we could exorcise Lucifer out of Cas, the Cage is damn near impenetrable. It took a spell from the Book of the Damned to spring Lucifer, and Rowena hid the book."
11,18,Dean,And we would need both the book and her to even have a shot.
11,18,Crowley,Did I say this would be easy? No. I did not.
11,18,Sam,Do you even know where Rowena is?
11,18,Crowley,"Rotting somewhere, I assume. Lucifer snapped her neck."
11,18,INTERIOR,"In the corridors of heaven, an angel [Jofiel] is checking the doors. He suddenly spots Lucifer."
11,18,Jofiel,Lucifer.
11,18,Lucifer,Jofiel. How's it hangin'?
11,18,Lucifer,"Easy, there."
11,18,Jofiel,"So perfect. Castiel, one of heaven's most wanted, possessed by heaven's most hated."
11,18,Lucifer,I come in peace. I just want to be a part of the action again. I want to lend a hand.
11,18,INTERIOR,Lucifer is addressing a room full of angels.
11,18,Lucifer,"Okay, guys. So, trying to smite the Darkness was a bust, huh? You had all of the power of heaven behind you. Couldn't even slow the bitch down. Well, no need to feel like abject losers. You learned a valuable lesson here. You need me. [He looks around, waiting for a response from any of the angels.] All right. Not giddy with awe."
11,18,Angel #1,You... exploded Jofiel.
11,18,Lucifer,Or did Jofiel explode himself? Just sayin'.
11,18,Angel #2,God cast you out of heaven.
11,18,Lucifer,"And who do you think spread that tabloid headline? It was Captain G, the Eternal One. And why? [Lucifer puts his face close to Angel #2, intimidating him with gentle forehead bumps.] Because I didn't buy in to His obsessive-compulsive love for mankind."
11,18,Angel #1,Mankind is His creation.
11,18,Angel #2,He said you're evil.
11,18,Angel #1,Incarnate. E-Evil incarnate.
11,18,Lucifer [smirking],It's marketing. He's creating a need in the consumer's mind. Can't be a Super Savior if you don't have a Super Villain.
11,18,Angel #3,"So, what are you offering?"
11,18,Lucifer,"Well, a way out of this pickle."
11,18,Angel #2,"By ""pickle,"" you mean the Darkness."
11,18,Angel #3,You can reason with her?
11,18,Lucifer,"Well...I doubt that. But I can lock her away. This time for good. Done it before. Oh, Pops didn't tell you that, huh?"
11,18,Angel #1,"Once you've... gotten rid of her, you'll want... to... stay around?"
11,18,Lucifer,"Oh, I like the way you think. [He claps.] Man, am I jazzed! Hey. If it makes you comfy, could call me God."
11,18,INTERIOR,"Sam, Dean and Crowley continue their conversation."
11,18,Dean,"Hold on, okay? Let's just put it in reverse. We will put Lucifer back in the Cage after we put Amara back on ice. It has to happen in that order, otherwise there is no Lucifer, there's no Cage, there's no nothing."
11,18,Crowley,He's spent years marinating in hate against us! He has to go.
11,18,Sam,"Problem is, we may need him."
11,18,Dean,He's been down this road with Amara before. He might be the only one powerful enough to use the Horn against her.
11,18,Crowley,"He had me cleaning the floors with my tongue! He called me ""puppy""! He made me beg!"
11,18,Dean,All right. Come on. Is this what this is about? Huh? Your stupid ego? The fact that he dissed you in front of a bunch of stupid demons? You're smarter than this. Come on!
11,18,Sam,Dean's right. Priority is to put the Horn in Lucifer's hands and set him loose on Amara.
11,18,Dean,After we exorcise Lucifer out of Cas and put him into a new vessel.
11,18,Sam,What? Really?
11,18,Dean,"Yes, really. We're not gonna send Lucifer into battle inside Cas. What if he doesn't make it?"
11,18,Sam,"Dean, it's a strong vessel. It's held Cas for years, and we know what he's been through. I'm guessing it can hold Lucifer."
11,18,Dean,"""It""? It's not an ""it,"" Sam. It's Cas."
11,18,Sam,And Cas wanted to do this.
11,18,Dean,"Yeah, well, there's times I want to get slapped during sex by a girl wearing a Zorro mask. That don't make it a good idea."
11,18,Sam,"Dean, this is exactly how we screw ourselves. W-We make the... the heart choice instead of the smart choice."
11,18,Dean,"Oh, okay. Thank you, Dr. Phil. Cas is family."
11,18,Sam,"Yes, and his choice deserves to be respected."
11,18,Dean,Even if it kills him?
11,18,Crowley,"It's killing me. I would rather stick white-hot skewers in my eyes than listen to you two bitches bicker! I gave you the terms of my deal. If Lucifer's not back in the Cage, the Horn stays hidden."
11,18,INTERIOR,Rowena continues to work her magic on Amara.
11,18,Rowena,The vessel is healing nicely. Soon you'll be shipshape and Bristol fashion.
11,18,Amara,You seem pleased with my progress. But I don't sense in you the capacity for kindness or...concern.
11,18,Rowena,"Kindness gets you a hug, not a seat at the big boys' table."
11,18,Amara,And what is it you want?
11,18,Rowena,"Oh, like yourself, I want revenge on Lucifer. But more than that, I want to be there when you remake the universe to your taste."
11,18,Amara,Oh? I'm told my tastes run towards the catastrophic.
11,18,Rowena,Aye. The Winchesters say you are all about destruction.
11,18,Amara,"The Winchesters are right. (Rowena starts to look worried.) But... what they call ""destruction"" [sighs] I call renovation. My blueprints. Not God's."
11,18,Rowena,That's my girl. Do things the way you would have done them.
11,18,Amara,I will. And where do you fit into that?
11,18,Rowena,"Oh, I can be useful. Provide you with information on the troublesome brothers and Lucifer... their plans. And even if it is born out of my own self-interest, I ... I care about you. I'm someone you can talk with. Confide in. Have you... have you ever had that?"
11,18,Amara,I've always been alone.
11,18,Rowena,"Oh, you don't have to be, darlin'!"
11,18,Amara,"Well... whatever you're doing, it seems to be working. Maybe I should try a little test."
11,18,INTERIOR,"In heaven, the angels are leaving the room."
11,18,Lucifer,"Thank you. Hey, I like your spunk. There's always room for a go-getter in my organization."
11,18,Lucifer,"Hey, I know I can count on you. But what about your people? They on board, or we need to do a little wing-twisting?"
11,18,Lucifer,Don't you think about it too long. You know what they say... he who hesitates...(snaps his fingers) ...disintegrates.
11,18,INTERIOR,"Sam, Dean and Crowley continue their conversation in the abandoned warehouse."
11,18,Sam,"You know, this is a dick move, Crowley. Even for you. You're not being reasonable."
11,18,Crowley,I don't have to be reasonable. I'm the king.
11,18,INTERIOR,Heaven
11,18,INTERIOR,Rowena watches as Amara closes her eyes and spreads her arms out.
11,18,Dean,What the hell was that?
11,18,EXTERIOR,"Sam, Dean and Crowley walk outside and look at the sky, which is stormy. Lightning breaks through the swirling clouds, while thunder crashes."
11,18,Dean,"You know what, fellas? I think that's her."
11,18,Lucifer,"Well, that... was a little payback, ladies and gents. I don't think Auntie Amara appreciated your little half-assed smiting. And, uh, guess what... this... this is just a teeny taste of what's to come. So, clearly my expertise is gonna come in handy. 'Cause God knows what's next. Ouch. I almost forgot. Um... God doesn't care."
11,18,INTERIOR,"In the warehouse, Rowena looks at Amara in fear and awe."
11,18,Amara [chuckling],Okay. I'm back.
11,18,INTERIOR,"Sam, Dean and Crowley go back inside."
11,18,Sam,"Okay. So now we all just saw what happens when she's in a bad mood, which, apparently, she's been in since the dawn of time."
11,18,Dean,I think she just rattled heaven with a flick of her pinkie finger. That's not a big enough dose of reality for you?
11,18,Crowley,Why are we arguing? We all know that he has to go back in the Cage.
11,18,Dean,"Yes, when it makes sense. Amara's the big picture here now, okay? Look, in order to take her out, Lucifer has got to have the Horn of Joshua. He does her, we do him. Check, please."
11,18,Amara,Well? What are the Winchesters preparing to do?
11,18,Rowena,"Mm, nothing. Paralyzed with fear. They don't know what to do."
11,18,Amara,You're right. You're actually handy to have around. [She pats Rowena on the face.]
11,18,INTERIOR,"Sam, Dean and Crowley continue their argument."
11,18,Dean,"Crowley, ticktock. You with us?"
11,18,Crowley,"The crux of your dispute is your contention that Lucifer, and only Lucifer, can use the Horn to beat Amara, right?"
11,18,Dean,You got it.
11,18,Crowley,"Well, that scenario only works if you actually possess said Horn, which you do not."
11,18,Sam [frustrated],"No, we don't. But you do, so..."
11,18,Crowley [yelling],"Exactly! I do! This isn't a negotiation. I have the high cards, and you have... Hold on. Give me a second. Let me have a look... no cards! My offer stands."
11,18,Dean,"When we sprung Lucifer from the Cage, we had Rowena and the Book of the Damned. Both of which we will need to put him back in the Cage, both of which are gone."
11,18,Sam,Guys.
11,18,Sam [louder],Guys. Look at this...
11,18,INTERIOR,"Inside a church, Dean spray-paints warding onto the floor. Sam holds a wooden cross. Rowena lurks in the background. She waves to the brothers."
11,18,Sam,I hate this.
11,18,Dean,Yeah.
11,18,Sam,"And, by the way, where the hell is Crowley? I mean, we're essentially all set up."
11,18,Dean,"Yeah, I mean, he's the one that boxed us into doing this. You'd think he'd have the decency to..."
11,18,Crowley,"Show up? He does. Because without the bait, well... a trap really isn't a trap, is it?"
11,18,Crowley,"First impressions can be deceiving, Moose. For instance, I once thought of you as dull and plodding. [Sam glares.] Oh, never mind. Bad analogy."
11,18,Dean,"For the record, we still think this is a bad idea. We should be using Lucifer, not icing him."
11,18,Crowley,I'm aware. So I'll be standing right here should you hesitate. The hand that giveth can so quickly taketh away.
11,18,Dean,"Yes, we getteth it."
11,18,Crowley,"So, Mummy, you were telling us your fascinating tale of resurrection. But you never did say exactly where you'd been this whole time."
11,18,Rowena,"Same as you, Fergus. Hiding. Once the Dark Prince knew I was alive, I wouldn't be."
11,18,Crowley,No mucking about like last time. The warding and the holy fire won't keep an archangel but for a moment. If he shows up at all.
11,18,Dean,"Oh, he'll show. He's too hungry to take Amara out, and we've got the blaster to do it."
11,18,Dean [yelling],"Sam, now!"
11,18,Lucifer,"I'm sorry. Your prayer implied that I'd be... joining the team, but I'm just not feeling the warm and fuzzy here. [Dean and Sam glance at one another, as Lucifer notices the Horn.] Wow. There it is. Powered up by Dad himself. Well, that bad boy plus me... That ought to take her out all right. [He claps and rubs his hands together in glee.] Let's get to it. Douse the flames. [He snaps his fingers impatiently.] Or don't?"
11,18,Dean,"Cas! Castiel, show yourself!"
11,18,Dean,Cas.
11,18,Castiel,What are you doing? What's... What's going on?
11,18,Dean,"Cas, listen to me. We don't have a whole lot of time, okay? You have got to..."
11,18,Dean,Cas.
11,18,Dean,"Castiel, show yourself!"
11,18,Dean,"Cas, expel him! You got to kick Lucifer out! Do you hear me?!"
11,18,Lucifer,"Honestly, I think he's happy with the arrangement. I mean, he did invite me in and all, Dean."
11,18,Lucifer [mockingly],Cas!
11,18,Lucifer,Hand over the weapon. What do you say? Or we can just wait for this warding to fail and I'll take it.
11,18,Crowley,Bloody hell.
11,18,TV announcer,Is it going to be all right?
11,18,TV crowd,It's going to be all right!
11,18,Crowley,Castiel?
11,18,Castiel,"Oh, Crowley. What are you doing here?"
11,18,Crowley,Is this the Winchesters' kitchen?
11,18,Castiel,"Sort of. I come here in my mind to pass the time. For some reason, it has excellent reception."
11,18,Crowley,What's wrong with you? What has Lucifer done to you?
11,18,Castiel,"Well, he mostly just leaves me alone. I'm just waiting here, you know, for the battle with the Darkness."
11,18,Crowley,He's really got his hooks in you. Snap out of it. Do you know what's happening out there? The Winchesters have trapped the abomination so that you can expel him so that they can put him back in the Cage...
11,18,Castiel,"Well, that doesn't sound like a very good idea."
11,18,Crowley,"In your current state, you're in no position to judge."
11,18,Castiel,"Wait. That was Dean I saw a minute ago, wasn't it?"
11,18,Crowley,Yes.
11,18,Castiel,And he wants me to expel Lucifer?
11,18,Crowley,Yes!
11,18,Castiel [laughing],"Ha, ha, ha! Well... he may have a more objective view of the situation. Maybe I should."
11,18,Crowley,"So, let's do it now before it's too late."
11,18,Lucifer,"It already is. [He sighs.] Really, Crowley? You want to put me back in the Cage? Well, I'm not going anywhere, and neither are you."
11,18,INTERIOR,Back in the church.
11,18,Sam,"You know, he's been gone a long time. I mean, what do you think is going on?"
11,18,Dean,"I don't know. Maybe Cas isn't willing to play ball. I mean, you said it yourself... he wanted this."
11,18,Rowena,"Can't you people do anything right?! Whilst all this dithering goes on, we're losing time! Look... the warding's beginning to fail."
11,18,Dean,"Come on, Cas. What the hell?"
11,18,Lucifer,"You second rate bean counter. [He picks Crowley up again and tosses him onto the table, barely missing Castiel’s TV.]"
11,18,Crowley,Aah!
11,18,Castiel,"Guys, you're gonna break something."
11,18,Lucifer,You wanted my throne. You plotted to replace me!
11,18,Crowley,Aah!
11,18,Lucifer,As if ambition and posturing were the same as majesty!
11,18,Sam,...omnis incursio infernalis adversarii. Omnis legio! Omnis con...
11,18,Lucifer,Everyone in hell despises you and sees you for exactly what you are... nothing.
11,18,Sam,"...potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii. Omnis legio! Omnis congregatio et secta diabolica! Ergo, Draco maledicte et omnis..."
11,18,Sam,"...legio diabolica, adiuramus te! Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii. Omnis legio! Omnis congregatio et secta diabolica! Ergo, Draco maledicte et omnis legio diabolica, adiuramus te!"
11,18,Sam,Crowley.
11,18,Crowley,Useless. Lucifer's hold on him is too strong.
11,18,Rowena [screaming],"Lads, the fire!"
11,18,Lucifer,"Ah. Trick me? You lied to me. You know, I could have been your warrior. [Smiling] Ah. Who needs ya? Well. It's just like Crowley to leave right when the party's getting started. Have a seat. [He motions and Sam and Dean, without control, are forced to sit.] As much as I get a giggle out of you two, and I do, there comes a time when every relationship has... run its course. So..."
11,18,Amara,"Oh, Lucifer. Dear nephew, my, how you've changed. [Lucifer smirks.] I was tracking her [she indicates Rowena] when she left my side."
11,18,Lucifer,You were safely sealed away. You're gonna wish you'd stayed there.
11,18,Amara,"I think you and I need to have a nice, long chat."
11,18,Dean [yelling],Cas?
11,18,INTERIOR,"Sam and Dean in the bunker. Sam brings a beer to Dean. It looks like they’ve been drinking for a while, with several empty beer bottles on the map table."
11,18,Sam,"So, Rowena and Crowley... like mother, like son, huh? They both took exactly one split second to take off when things started going south."
11,18,Dean,Yep.
11,18,Sam,"Here [handing the beer to Dean]. By the way, what's Rowena doing with Amara?"
11,18,Dean,"My guess... she's playing the odds. When sucking up to Lucifer didn't work out, maybe she thought Amara was the best bet. Then she heard Lucifer had a shot, so she switched horses again."
11,18,Sam,"I thought Lucifer had a shot. Apparently, uh, archangel plus God power doesn't trump God’s sister."
11,18,Dean,"But if the thing has to be used by God's chosen, then maybe an archangel who got the boot doesn't qualify. Either way, horn's out of ammo, so..."
11,18,Sam,"So, back to square one."
11,18,Dean,Yep. [Sighing.]
11,18,Sam,"Listen, um... I know I came down on the side of wanting Cas to deal with Amara, so..."
11,18,Dean,"Well, that's what he wanted, though, right? Besides, didn't we say that we were gonna swear off getting in the way when one person makes a choice the other doesn't agree with?"
11,18,Sam,"Yeah, um... Yeah, we did say that."
11,18,Dean,So...
11,18,Sam,"Okay. So, that's our policy."
11,18,Dean,"Which sounds damn good. [Sam chuckles.] Well, let's go find that idiot and bring him home."
11,18,INTERIOR,Amara throws Lucifer against the wall.
11,18,Amara,Really?
11,18,Lucifer,You hadn't considered? We both have an axe to grind with God. I know his soft spots. He can't handle us both.
11,18,Amara,"Do you, for one moment, think that I would actually consider trusting you for anything? I did trust you once. You and my brother conspired to seal me away for eons. But you're right. You might be of some use to me."
11,18,Lucifer,All right. Good. Now we're talking.
11,18,Amara,"As God's favorite, his first son, you may be the one thing in all of creation that he still cares about, the one thing that could finally make him show himself so that I can confront him and he can acknowledge the wrongs he's done me. And then he can witness the utter destruction of all his creation... before he himself is swept away."
11,18,Lucifer [smirking],You're expecting him? Oh. Well... I wouldn't wait up. I'm pretty sure he caught the last train out.
11,18,Amara,"Well... we'll see, won't we?"
11,19,EXTERIOR,Wide shot of woods with small creek and half-dried bushes.
11,19,Jesse,It finally happened.
11,19,Matt,What? You didn’t get detention this week?
11,19,Jesse,"Me and Jackie, we kissed."
11,19,Matt,"Okay, can I stop hearing about him every two minutes now? “You think he likes me?”, “Jackie looked at me. I-I think he looked at me.”"
11,19,Jesse,He definitely likes me.
11,19,Matt,"Jesse, you know you gotta be careful, right?"
11,19,Jesse,I’m not an idiot.
11,19,Matt,"Yeah, I know, but it’s not just Ned and Charlie and those dicks who’ll stomp your head in. I mean, everybody at school and in town … they won’t leave you alone."
11,19,Jesse,Okay. I wish we were gone already. Can’t you lie and say you’re 18 and get a fake ID?
11,19,Matt,"California’s expensive, okay? We just gotta save some more money."
11,19,Jesse,You can sell your collection.
11,19,Matt,"I will, okay? When it’s time. I can get at least $900 for the Buffalo nickel and another $400 for the double eagle."
11,19,Jesse,That’s a lot.
11,19,Mattther,"Look, Jess."
11,19,Matt,"As soon as I turn 18, I promise, we’re gonna get out of here, okay?"
11,19,Jesse,Can I see it?
11,19,Matt,Yeah.
11,19,Matt,Come on. Here.
11,19,Matt,"Gotta go get that early morning bit, right?"
11,19,Jesse,Hang on. I gotta pee.
11,19,Jesse,[aware] Matty? Matty?
11,19,EXTERIOR,The bushes where Matt and Jesse are talking before.
11,19,Matt,[in the distance] Jesse! Aah!
11,19,Jesse,[screaming] Matty! Matty!
11,19,Matt,[in the distance] Jesse! Aah!
11,19,Jesse,Matty! [chases the creature] Matty! Matty! Matty!
11,19,EXTERIOR,The Men of Letters’ bunker walls and surrounding woods. The Impala parks just outside the entrance.
11,19,INTERIOR,"The bunker’s War Room. Dean is sitting on one of the chairs, reading a book. Sam comes in carrying a bowl of cereal."
11,19,Sam,"Dude, you even move since last night?"
11,19,Dean,[tiredly] Sleeping is the new smoking.
11,19,Sam,"What? No, it’s not. It’s sitting. Sitting is the new smoking."
11,19,Dean,That’s can’t be right.
11,19,Sam,"Dean, we’ll find Cas, okay? He’s stronger that he looks."
11,19,Dean,"You know, we gambled with Cas, and now Amara has him."
11,19,Sam,"For a reason, which means he’s still alive."
11,19,Dean,"[shakes his head] I’ve been with Amara. Her beef is with the big guys … with God, with Lucifer. The small fries, even an angel like Cas, doesn’t even register. And if it meant hurting Lucifer, killing Cas would mean nothing to her."
11,19,Sam,It’s been a week. We’ve still got no leads.
11,19,Dean,You think I don’t know that? [rises from the chair]
11,19,Sam,So … so we get back out there. We get back to work. We keep moving. We keep working. We’ll catch a break on Cas. We have to. It’s … it’s karma.
11,19,Dean,"[looks to another book] You know, karma’s been kicking us in the teeth lately."
11,19,Sam,"Yeah. [puts bowl down and lifts laptop] So … let’s kick it back. Here, check this out [opens laptop]."
11,19,Sam,"Libby Strauss. Uh, went missing near Gunnison, Colorado. Now Libby’s friend claimed she was carried off by a mutant creature with green eyes."
11,19,Dean,[sits back on the chair] Demon?
11,19,Sam,"That’s what I thought, but it gets better. The friend chased after ‘em and she found Libby, only it wasn’t Libby anymore because now she, too, is a green-eyed mutant."
11,19,Dean,Demon swap suits?
11,19,Sam,Only one way to find out.
11,19,EXTERIOR,The Impala drives on the road.
11,19,EXTERIOR,A police station on the countryside with mountain view on the background.
11,19,INTERIOR,"Sheriff’s office, Sam and Dean sat with the female coloured-skin sheriff."
11,19,Sam,How many missing do you have?
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,"Six, all in the last forty-eight hours. They’re disappearing one by one."
11,19,Sam,"Okay, uh, let’s start with Libby Strauss. I understand that she was from out of town?"
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,"Uh, she and a friend were visiting from Tuscon. Libby was the first reported missing."
11,19,Dean,But all the rest have been local?
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,All residents.
11,19,Sam,you got any leads?
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,[inhaling] The only eyewitness I have is the friend. Not the most reliable source.
11,19,Dean,Why is that?
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,She and Libby were on the last legs of their cannabis tasting tour. Fumes still coming off the girl when I questioned her.
11,19,Dean,A trippin’ trip.
11,19,Sam,Have you had anything odd like this happen around here before?
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,"[gets up from her chair and moves closer to Sam and Dean, leans on her desk] Twenty-seven years ago. About a dozen residents went missing. Twenty-seven years before that, another eight disappeared."
11,19,Dean,All within the same time frame? Couple days?
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,"Same time of year, too."
11,19,Sam,And how far back do the disappearances go?
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,[shrugs] That’s it. The town’s only been here since the fifties. It was all virgin forest till they found coal here.
11,19,Dean,So then how do people explain the missing?
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,"[sadly] Mostly they don’t. People come and go in this town. I’ve only been here two years, myself. There are some old-timers with their theories."
11,19,Sam,Such as?
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,Town’s built on an Indian burial ground. Forest folk are pissed because we stole their coal.
11,19,Sam,And what’s your take?
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,"We’re a small town. People get bored, they get fed up, they leave. Once a few get free, it’s like a jail break. Encourages the others."
11,19,Dean,Every twenty-seven years like clockwork?
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,"Honestly, I-I’m just focused on the missing that I have right now. You’re welcome to take a look at the files, talk to the witness. I’ve got panicked residents I need to talk down."
11,19,Sam,Right. Sure.
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,"walks out of her office, leaving Sam and Dean."
11,19,Dean,What the hell is going on here?
11,19,Sam,"No idea. Whatever it is, it’s moved in. Or keeps coming back for seconds. All right, I’ll go check on the reports on the other missing."
11,19,Dean,Oh. I guess that leaves me Ganja Girl.
11,19,INTERIOR,"Outside interrogation room, a cabinet with folder filing ,table lamp, and coffee machine was on top of the cabinet. An officer is seen taking a drink from the water dispenser. Dean is inside the interrogation room with Ganja Girl, or Cori."
11,19,Cori,You’re gonna say I was hallucinating. The weed was laced with PCP or something.
11,19,Dean,"It’s okay, Cory, just … just …. Tell me what you remember. And nothing is too strange or weird to mention."
11,19,Cori,"[hesitates] The thing that took Libby was naked and pale. Except for the eyes. I swear to God, they flashed green for a second."
11,19,Cori,And it didn’t have any hair. Anywhere.
11,19,Cori,It was shaped like a man. Or was it a woman?
11,19,Dean,[curiously] Was it a man or a woman?
11,19,Cori,It didn’t have a … [points downward with her fingers]
11,19,Dean,A penis?
11,19,Cori,[wide-eyed] It didn’t have anything.
11,19,Dean,What you’re saying it was junkless?
11,19,Cori,Completely.
11,19,Dean,"Okay, uh … anything else unusual you can remember? Sounds? Smells?"
11,19,Cori,"Definitely sound. When I found Libby, when was just standing there … shivering, shaking."
11,19,FLASHBACK,"We see Libby standing in the dark, looking down and her hands are shaking, unusual sound is coming out from her. Cori was approaching her."
11,19,Cori,Libby?
11,19,Cori,What happened?
11,19,INTERIOR,Interrogation room.
11,19,Cori,It wasn’t Libby. [paused] I don’t know what it was.
11,19,Dean,The buzzing … was coming from her body?
11,19,Cori,[nods] We heard the same sound right before that thing jumped out at us.
11,19,INTERIOR,"File room in the police station, Sam is browsing through old files with his laptop open and Dean sits on the desk in front of his brother."
11,19,Dean,"Green eyes, buzzing. Weed alone doesn’t conjure up that kind of scenario. [turns to Sam] Isn’t that right, Sam?"
11,19,Sam,"[turns to Dean with a caught expression] Dude, I was eighteen."
11,19,Dean,Sinner. [smirked]
11,19,Sam,It was college. It was probably oregano anyways.
11,19,Dean,Rebel. [smiled]
11,19,Sam,"You’re an idiot. Look, I’m coming up empty also. Uh, nothing on Junkless or the green-eyed shaker."
11,19,Dean,[turns to Sam] So we think Junkless turned Libby?
11,19,Sam,"Hold up. We’re not actually gonna go with “Junkless” on this, are we?"
11,19,Dean,Eh. [shrugs head]
11,19,Sam,"Dude, that’s a new low, even for us."
11,19,Dean,"Well, something happened. You got the eyes, the buzzing."
11,19,Sam,"Yeah, I know you’re right. That’s can’t be a coincidence. Uh, here, I found this, [picks a file from the pile of paper], the, uh, the sheriff who was here in ’89, Cochran [hands the papers to Dean]. Those are his notes. There’s no mention of buzzing. But he seemed to be closing in on some of the missing, and then his notes, they just kind of abruptly stop."
11,19,Dean,"[reading the papers] He take a flyer, too?"
11,19,Sam,"No. he remained sheriff for a few more months. He ended up resigning and, uh, then he fell off the radar. I asked around the station, but that was a few sheriffs ago, so … [shakes head]."
11,19,Dean,Nothing?
11,19,Sam,"The dispatcher said she thought he moved to Florida, but that was a dead end."
11,19,Dean,Kind of like this case.
11,19,Sam,"Yeah [flips another file papers]. Wait a second. Most of the witnesses in ’89 and ’62, they’re all dead or they’re moved away, but there’s does seem to be one holdout from the ’89 case, Etta Fraser [turns to Dean]."
11,19,Dean,Let’s go talk to Etta.
11,19,INTERIOR,Living room of a suburban house.
11,19,Sam,Your husband was one of the people who disappeared in 1989.
11,19,Etta,"Oh, my second husband. Barely that. Pete only stuck around a couple months."
11,19,Dean,So he left voluntarily?
11,19,Etta,"Oh [chuckles], Pete was volunteering himself all over the place [nods]. Right before he disappeared, people saw Pete diddling two different women in public, separate occasions."
11,19,Dean,You mean they actually saw him in the act?
11,19,Etta,"[deadpans] What does “diddling” mean to you? Uh, Pete was never a showman, but apparently, Doris Kagen and Missy Petersen brought out the hog in him."
11,19,Sam,"Doris and Melissa, uh, Missy, they disappeared that year, too."
11,19,Etta,"[scoffs] Oh, yeah. Surprise, surprise. I’d bet my mortgage Pete ran off with one of them."
11,19,Sam,But you reported them as missing.
11,19,Etta,"Well, he didn’t come home for three days. I thought he was dead in a ditch somewhere. We didn’t find out about the women for a long time after."
11,19,Sam,Is that … is that white sage?
11,19,Etta,"[nods] Mm. yeah, you know your herbs [smiles flirtatiously]."
11,19,Dean,"You, uh, planning on taking a trip? [nods to the suitcases on the hall]"
11,19,Etta,"Uh, yeah, I’m going to stay with my sister a few weeks."
11,19,Dean,For any reason?
11,19,Etta,[turns her head from the suitcases] You’re gonna think it’s real out there.
11,19,Sam,"Well, you’re be surprised at the kind of crazy we hear [smiles]."
11,19,Etta,"Well [licks her lips], when Pete went missing and we found out about the women, my grandma said that he “got the chitters”. According to her, once a generation around the spring equinox, people in town start going nuts, have orgies, copulating in the woods. And then they disappear, never to be heard from again."
11,19,Dean,"Well, that’s certainly one explanation for Pete."
11,19,Etta,"I never really, um, believed what she said, but … now people are disappearing again [nods]. She always said burn sage to protect yourself [shrugs]."
11,19,Sam,Hmm. So why did she call it “the chitters”?
11,19,Etta,"Oh, that was the word Gran used to describe the sound coming from the woods when the orgies were happening. Yeah, kind of a buzzing, rattling."
11,19,Dean,"Did your Gran ever mention something about, uh, green eyes?"
11,19,Etta,"Oh, yeah [nods]. Gran said that if you got the chitters, you get so revved up with lust that your eyes would shine like emeralds [looks affectionately to Sam]."
11,19,Sam,[smiles nervously] Uh …
11,19,EXTERIOR,Outside Etta’s house.
11,19,Sam,"So, we got spring equinox. Which was yesterday."
11,19,Dean,"Orgies, buzzing green-eyed freaks. Sounds like a rager."
11,19,Sam,"All right, let’s pick up a six-pack."
11,19,Dean,Just six?
11,19,Sam,"Oh, whatever. Let’s hit the books."
11,19,EXTERIOR,"A path under the bridge, the walls are filled with graffiti. A couple of man and woman was walking through the path, talking."
11,19,Girl,Just don’t be a wuss. It’s faster this way.
11,19,Cliff,"And it smells like a urinal, but whatevs."
11,19,Cliff,Whoa.
11,19,Woman,[screams]
11,19,Cliff,Come on!
11,19,EXTERIOR,The police station with siren blaring in the distance. The Impala is parked outside.
11,19,INTERIOR,The interrogation room. Sam and Dean are asking the girl from previous incident under the bridge.
11,19,Woman,"We ran, and then another one with green eyes came from nowhere. It was Coach Hollister."
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,Grant Hollister?
11,19,Woman,"He attacked us. He had these teeth that were pointed. He ripped into Cliff. I could hear him screaming, but … I ran."
11,19,Woman,He killed Cliff.
11,19,Sam,"Did you, by any chance, recognize the couple?"
11,19,Woman,"[nods] It was one of the Deaver brothers, the tall one, and Mrs. Limoski."
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,You’re sure about this?
11,19,Dean,Did you see anybody else?
11,19,Woman,"I couldn’t see their faces, but I’m pretty sure there was more of them down the alley, past the couple. I-I could see them moving around."
11,19,Dean,"The, uh, the couple that-that was going at it, would you say this was a … orgy-like situation?"
11,19,Woman,I’ve never seen an orgy.
11,19,Dean,No?
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,Enough.
11,19,Sam,Excuse us a second.
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,[turns to face the brothers] I got a dead kid minus a chunk out of his neck and all the people that girl ID’ed missing.
11,19,Dean,"Were missing. Yeah, not they’re all having sex with each other."
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,Then there’s that.
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,"Putting aside the fact that Rob the fireman is screwing the librarian, and I am friends with his pregnant wife, now I’ve got two witnesses claiming they saw … what? I don’t even know. Aliens? Attacking people. Yeah. What is this? Spanish Fly gone bad?"
11,19,Dean,"Well, I can honestly say this is a new one for us."
11,19,Sheriff Tyson,I gotta go contact the families.
11,19,Sam,Right.
11,19,Dean,So we have confirmed orgy-ish behaviour.
11,19,Sam,"Yeah, just like Etta’s husband."
11,19,Dean,"What, the chitters? [walks]"
11,19,Sam,"[follows his brother] Well, we should go check the crime scene."
11,19,Dean,"[answers phone] Agent Lewis. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey [stops and listens to the person on line]. Cori, calm down! Where exactly? [listens to Cori on the phone] All right, I’m on my way [lines off phone]."
11,19,Dean,"Ganja Girl’s pretty hysterical, says she just saw her friend walking in the woods. She’s too freaked out to go, so …"
11,19,Sam,You go. I’ll grab the alley.
11,19,Dean,Great.
11,19,EXTERIOR,"The woods near the suburb area. The Impala is seen coming and stops inside the woods. Dean steps out and starts checking the surroundings. There’s a rattling sound coming near him, and he turns. There’s a girl standing with her head down."
11,19,Dean,Libby?
11,19,Dean,"Hey, Libby, there’s a whole lot of people looking for you."
11,19,Dean,Uhh!
11,19,Cesar,You hurt?
11,19,Dean,"No, I’m-I’m-I’m good. Thanks."
11,19,Cesar,"Jesse, I think it’s dead."
11,19,Jesse,Just making sure.
11,19,Dean,[confused] Who the hell are you guys?
11,19,Jesse,You wouldn’t believe us.
11,19,EXTERIOR,The view of the woods and mountain behind it. The Impala and another car are parked outside a countryside-styled restaurant.
11,19,INTERIOR,The restaurant with billiard balls colliding on the background. A waitress brings two bottles of beer to Dean and the other men’s table.
11,19,Dean,"So, how long you guys been hunting? [looks to Cesar and Jesse in turns]"
11,19,Jesse,"Together? About seven years. And we’ve heard of the Winchesters, but we also heard you bit it a couple years ago."
11,19,Dean,"Ah, that’s a long, ugly, ugly story [shakes head and turns to the entrance door when Sam walks in]."
11,19,Sam,Hey [waves].
11,19,Dean,"Sam, hey. Uh, Jesse and Cesar [waves hand to Jesse, then Cesar]."
11,19,Sam,"[shakes hand with the other hunters] You guys are hunters, right?"
11,19,Cesar,Yeah.
11,19,Sam,I’m surprised we never ran into you [sits next to Dean].
11,19,Cesar,"Well, we’re mostly in Mexico. Sometimes we make a run over into Texas."
11,19,Sam,"Nice. Uh, nothing in the alley, by the way [taps Dean’s shoulder]. Thanks [looks to the waitress who brings him beer, smiles to Dean, and takes a second look to the waitress]."
11,19,Dean,You guys have any idea what we’re hunting?
11,19,Jesse,They’re called Bisaan. It’s a kind of cicada spirit.
11,19,Sam,We couldn’t find any lore on ‘em.
11,19,Jesse,"They’re rare, at least in America. People think that they originated in Malaysia, in the forests there."
11,19,Dean,So what are they doing here?
11,19,Jesse,"What they always do. Every 27 years, they come up from the underground, they mate like crazy for a few days. That generation dies off, and the whole cycle goes on repeat."
11,19,Sam,So they’re reproducing?
11,19,Dean,"But we’re-we’re dealing with townsfolk here. I mean, they didn’t just crawl out of a hole a few days ago."
11,19,Jesse,"This is what surfaces [gets his tablet]. Bisaan can’t reproduce on their own [shows a picture of wayang on the screen], so they take over a human body to do the deed. They enter through the mouth, like a hermit crab climbing into a shell."
11,19,Cesar,Only they don’t care that the shell’s not empty.
11,19,Dean,"Well, that explains Junkless."
11,19,Sam,What about the buzzing?
11,19,Jesse,It’s how they communicate. It’s a mating call.
11,19,Dean,"And you, um, kill them by taking off their heads, I see."
11,19,Jesse,Seems to do the trick.
11,19,Sam,How do you guys knows so much about these things?
11,19,Jesse,One of them took my brother 27 years ago.
11,19,Sam,[looks to Jesse] I’m sorry to hear that.
11,19,Jesse,"I’ve been waiting years to come back and have this shot at them. So, I hope you understand, I’m gonna ask you two to take a step back from this one."
11,19,Dean,"[nods] Well, catch us up. Where have you guys been?"
11,19,Jesse,"In the woods, where the action is, looking for their burrow and saving your ass."
11,19,Jesse,What?
11,19,Cesar,"Well, one of the reasons we’ve been holed up in the trees is because Jesse hates the town and everyone in it."
11,19,Jesse,"Because they’re ignorant and useless. [turns to Cesar] They didn’t believe me 27 years ago, they’re not gonna start now."
11,19,Cesar,[sternly] It’s boneheaded not to be following leads in town.
11,19,Jesse,"Hey, nobody stopping you from talking to the whole box of crackers."
11,19,Dean,"Ah, you guys fight just like brothers [chuckles], almost as bad as us."
11,19,Cesar,"Well, [paused], it’s more like an old married couple."
11,19,Dean,[laughed] That’s … [looks to Cesar]
11,19,Dean,"[with realisation] Oh, so … [points back and forth to Jesse and Cesar]"
11,19,Cesar,Yeah.
11,19,Dean,"Okay, that’s …"
11,19,Dean,"What’s it like, settling down with a hunter?"
11,19,Cesar,"Smelly, dirty. [turns to Jesse] Twice the worrying about getting ganked."
11,19,Dean,[nods] Huh.
11,19,Sam,"Jesse, you’re from here. Do you know anything about the sheriff, Cochran, who worked the case back in ’89?"
11,19,Jesse,That son of a bitch was incompetent. He shut himself away years ago.
11,19,Sam,Do you know where he is?
11,19,Jesse,"Turned tail, ran off into the hills, couple towns over. [angrily] Lives like a hermit."
11,19,Sam,"Can you take us there? Uh, it seems like he was honing in on some of the missing."
11,19,Jesse,[sternly] We need to find the burrow.
11,19,Cesar,"[patiently] Jess, we’ve been beating around the woods for two days."
11,19,Jesse,[stubbornly] That’s where they are. You saw the tracks.
11,19,Cesar,I can keep searching on my own. We’re losing.
11,19,Dean,Why don’t I go with you? [looks to Cesar] We’ll start where-where I got jumped.
11,19,INTERIOR,The Impala was going down the road. It’s raining.
11,19,Dean,How long do we have before these things are gone?
11,19,Cesar,"[sitting on the passenger seat] We gotta find the burrow tonight. By tomorow, the Bisaan will be underground, dying. Won’t be able to find them or their eggs. [angrily] And Jesse will wait another 27 years."
11,19,Dean,Well there’s four of us now.
11,19,Dean,We’ll smoke those sons of bitches.
11,19,Cesar,"Yeah, it’ll eat him alive if we don’t."
11,19,Dean,"It’s hard to watch someone go through that, isn’t it?"
11,19,Cesar,"[huffs] Yeah, [pauses], I never had a brother or a sister, but I’ve seen it over and over, when someone loses someone when they’re young. It never heals over."
11,19,Dean,"No, it doesn’t."
11,19,Cesar,"And the insane thing is, how many hunters have you seen over the years get their revenge?"
11,19,Dean,A few.
11,19,Cesar,"Yeah. Me too. [pauses] And they are never fixed, are they?"
11,19,Dean,"No, I guess not. [pauses] But, you gotta help him get that revenge anyway [turns to Cesar]."
11,19,EXTERIOR,"The woods where Dean met Cesar and Jesse before. Dean and Cesar investigate the surroundings using torches. They found footsteps to the deeper side of the woods. Cesar signals to Dean to check it out, while he’s looking for another signs of Bisaan around the woods."
11,19,EXTERIOR,Jesse and Cesar’s SUV vehicle.
11,19,INTERIOR,"Jesse driving the car, and Sam sat on the passenger seat."
11,19,Jesse,"[sighs] I must’ve stumbled around searching for Matty, ten, twenty minutes. I was shaking and panicking. Told myself I had to focus, find him, and I did. Those green eyes staring at me. It wasn’t human. [looks to Sam] I took off, didn’t look back."
11,19,Sam,You never saw him again after that?
11,19,Jesse,"[shakes head] Everybody in town, including my Mom, thought some pervert had taken him. She was falling apart, crying. Why didn’t I remember what the guy looked like? Why was I making up this lie?"
11,19,Sam,She still live here?
11,19,Jesse,Moved as soon as she could. Still thinks I should’ve done something. Saved him. Everybody did.
11,19,Sam,"They couldn’t accept that your brother was taken by a monster, huh? [smiles understandingly]"
11,19,Jesse,They couldn’t accept a lot of things. But Matty did. [pauses] He was a great brother.
11,19,EXTERIOR,The woods where Dean and Cesar are looking for the Bisaan’s burrow.
11,19,Dean,You good?
11,19,Cesar,Go!
11,19,EXTERIOR,"An old wooden house on the hill. Jesse’s SUV is parked outside the house, along with the house owner’s car."
11,19,INTERIOR,"Living room of the house, table is full of beer bottles. Sam and Jesse are sitting in front of the former sheriff, Cochran."
11,19,Cochran,"I don’t care if you’re FBI or not. It was thirty years ago, I don’t remember a damn thing. Except we never found him."
11,19,Jesse,"Well, one of them is a sixteen-year old boy, and that was my brother."
11,19,Cochran,A lot of folks lost family that year.
11,19,Jesse,"And you didn’t help a damn one of them, did you?"
11,19,Sam,[turns to Jesse] Jesse …
11,19,Sam,"Mr. Cochran, we’re here because more people have gone missing. The same M.O."
11,19,Cochran,"No. No, it’s done. It’s done."
11,19,EXTERIOR,The woods where Cesar and Dean are.
11,19,Dean,Cesar?
11,19,Cesar,You lost it?
11,19,Dean,"[pants] No. no, I followed it. I saw where it went. I think I found the burrow."
11,19,Cesar,[sighs] Thank God.
11,19,Dean,I think that’s why he attacked you. He was being protective.
11,19,Cesar,Of what?
11,19,Dean,"The females, the burrow."
11,19,Cesar,"Oh, that makes sense. Must be laying their eggs by now."
11,19,Dean,You gonna be all right?
11,19,Cesar,Yeah. Where are we headed?
11,19,Dean,It’s a hike.
11,19,Cesar,That’s okay.
11,19,Dean,"I tried to call Sam, there’s no service."
11,19,Cesar,Do you think the whole brood’s there?
11,19,Dean,[nods] If we’re lucky.
11,19,Cesar,Let’s go.
11,19,Dean,All right.
11,19,INTERIOR,Wash basin inside a kitchen.
11,19,Cochran,"Okay, I’ll tell you what. Leave your card, and if anything comes back to me, I’ll call."
11,19,Sam,"Mr. Cochran, you don’t own a phone. Look, we’re not asking for a lot. Just please tell us what you know."
11,19,Cochran,I couldn’t find them. So that’s on me.
11,19,Cochran,"[sighs] I never recovered from it. I-I … [scratches his nose] So, I bought this little slice of heaven and made my peace. I wish you all better luck."
11,19,Jesse,"Joe, please. I was twelve when my brother got taken. [rises from his seat] I never got over what I lost that day, the one person in the whole world I loved the most."
11,19,Cochran,"Okay, I’m gonna say this once. It’s time for you to go."
11,19,Sam,"Listen, we know what took Jesse’s brother, [rises from his seat] and what took all the townspeople then and now. You know, Jesse was only a kid at the time, but he was telling the truth. What took these people was not human."
11,19,Cochran,[sceptically] How do you know?
11,19,Sam,It’s what we do.
11,19,Jesse,I saw one of the creatures today.
11,19,Cochran,"I knew she was something. I-I didn’t know what. I tracked one of those things down in ’89. It-it-it was sick and dying. I … I followed it back to its-its lair, I guess. [pauses] My daughter was there. [sobs] Couple of days before that, she had left to go back to school, I … [sobs] I don’t know what happened. But she was one of them [sobs]."
11,19,Sam,Wait a second. You never reported her as missing.
11,19,Cochran,"[looks to Sam and shakes his head] I knew where she was. [sobs] All the missing people were … scattered all around, dead. I think she and that other thing had killed them. [pauses] I tried … I tried talking to her, but she attacked me like some kind of rabid wolf. Teeth like thorns. I killed her."
11,19,Jesse,[angrily pushed Cochran down the chair] You son of a bitch.
11,19,Jesse,You knew the whole time! You knew where they were when everybody was suffering.
11,19,Cochran,[pushes Jesse off him] I was suffering too!
11,19,Sam,"[pulls Jesse away from Cochran and tries to calm him down] Jesse. Hey, hey. Hold on. Hold on."
11,19,Cochran,You think anybody would’ve believed me? Monsters?
11,19,Jesse,"[points to his head] You told me I was making it up! We could’ve told people together, found those things!"
11,19,Cochran,They were already dying. All the missing people were dead.
11,19,Jesse,"No. you didn’t wanna say that your kid was one of them, a monster, and that you …"
11,19,Sam,Hey [pushes Jesse back].
11,19,Jesse,… killed her.
11,19,Sam,Jesse.
11,19,Jesse,You killed her.
11,19,Sam,"Jesse, stop. Stop. [turns to Cochran] What did you do? What, did you just erase her from your life? pretend that she just went away somewhere?"
11,19,Cochran,"[takes a picture of his daughter from under the newspaper] Yeah, better to bury it. [voice cracks] All of it. We just let the townspeople think their loved ones had run off for a big, bright life."
11,19,Sam,Where was she? Where did you find her?
11,19,Cochran,By Taylor Creek [sobs]. The old Donnelly mine [looks and hugs the picture of his daughter].
11,19,Sam,Come on [taps Jesse’s chest and pulls him out from the living room]
11,19,EXTERIOR,The woods dark and eerie.
11,19,Dean,[sighs happily] Oh.
11,19,Cesar,[pants] I hate it when I lose my blade.
11,19,Dean,Yeah [pants]. You could’ve jumped in anytime [stands up using the shovel].
11,19,Cesar,What is this place?
11,19,Dean,It’s a maternity ward/subway station. That’s home … I think that’s a tunnel.
11,19,Cesar,That’s gotta go topside eventually.
11,19,Dean,"Mothers area already dead. Males weren’t protecting them, they were protection the eggs?"
11,19,Cesar,They must gestate inside for years ‘til they hatch.
11,19,Dean,"Yeah, well, these aren’t. I got about five gallons gasoline in the car. I’ll go pull her around."
11,19,EXTERIOR,"The Impala, her boot is opened and Dean is tightened a gasoline bottle. There’s light coming from another car. It’s Jesse and Sam."
11,19,Sam,[closes the car door] Did you guys find the burrow?
11,19,Jesse,Where are they?
11,19,Dean,"They’re in the mine. Don’t worry, they won’t be coming back out. We just gotta take care of the eggs."
11,19,Jesse,You okay?
11,19,Cesar,"Hell, yeah. It’s finally over [smiles]."
11,19,Dean,You wanna finish them off? [lifts the gasoline]
11,19,Cesar,Let’s give him a minute.
11,19,INTERIOR,"The burrow, there are many remains of Bisaan’s victims. Jesse was on his knees in front of one of the victims, while the other men came and give him lights."
11,19,Jess,"Ah, jeez. Hey, bro. [sobs] We found Matty."
11,19,Jesse,"Ah, jeez. [picks something from underneath the remains] Oh, God."
11,19,FLASHBACK,Jesse looks at the nickel the first time as a boy.
11,19,Cesar,We’ll give him a proper burial.
11,19,Jesse,[sobs] What about the others?
11,19,Dean,"Don’t worry. We’ll, uh, [lifts the gasoline] we’ll take care of it."
11,19,EXTERIOR,"Daylight, the other side of the woods."
11,19,Sam,"You know, whenever you and Dad used to leave me to go hunting, and I-and I wouldn’t hear from y’all for a while, I, um, I was always sure that some vamp or rugaru, or take your pick, I always figured one of them finally got ya. I tried to think what to do, you know, the next step to take. [shakes head] I was just lost."
11,19,Dean,"We came back, though, every time."
11,19,Sam,Yeah.
11,19,Dean,"And look at Jesse, I mean, he turned out all right."
11,19,Sam,They’re a good team.
11,19,Dean,"They are. I was thinking, maybe they could give us a hand with Amara, you know, with Cas."
11,19,Sam,"Fresh eyes. Could use the extra muscle, too."
11,19,Dean,Yeah.
11,19,Cesar,You did it [places arm around Jesse’s shoulder].
11,19,Jesse,We did it [holds Cesar’s hand on his shoulder]. Thank you.
11,19,EXTERIOR,Walking path on the woods.
11,19,Sam,"You know, it’s a good thing you guys had that fire extinguisher."
11,19,Jesse,"Yeah, for a second there, I thought the whole mine was gonna go up in flames."
11,19,Cesar,"Yeah, you loved it. Like twenty-seven birthdays and Christmases all in one fireball."
11,19,Dean,"Well, you’re awfully upbeat for a guy who spent half the night in a cave."
11,19,Cesar,"That’s because we have a deal. When we finished this hunt, if we caught them, we hang up our spurs."
11,19,Sam,Nice.
11,19,Jesse,Unless your hides need saving.
11,19,Dean,No [shakes head].
11,19,Dean,"[smiles] No, we’re all set."
11,19,Sam,"So, uh, what’s freedom look like?"
11,19,Jesse,Nice little spread in New Mexico. We’ve been paying on it for years. Set foot on it about … twice?
11,19,Cesar,"Gonna raise horses. And if that goes bust, Jesse used to be an EMT."
11,19,Jesse,"Oh, so now I’m supporting your ass?"
11,19,Cesar,It’s time to start living.
11,19,Sam,"Couldn’t do it, huh?"
11,19,Dean,"[shakes head] No, didn’t feel right."
11,19,Sam,Yeah. I know what you mean. Two hunters who make it to the finish line?
11,19,Dean,"Yeah, you leave that alone."
11,21,Dean,"What the hell's going on here, exactly?"
11,21,Chuck,"I'm happy to... fill in the blanks, but maybe we should go somewhere where we could actually sit down."
11,21,Dean,"We're not going anywhere with you. Okay, how do we even know that you're really Chuck and not just some [suddenly, Boys and Chuck are in the bunker]
crazy spell or manifest...ation. [Kevin appears just behind Chuck's shoulder]"
11,21,Sam,Kevin?
11,21,Kevin,"Guys! You're looking stressed. Especially you. [to Dean] I-It's cool. Trust Chuck. Whatever it is he needs you to do, he must think you can handle it. I always trusted you."
11,21,Dean,"Yeah, that ended well."
11,21,Sam,"How did you – Are you okay, or – uh?"
11,21,Kevin,"Um... Yeah, I mean, you know, given the circumstances."
11,21,Chuck,"Yeah, I don't mean to interrupt. Kind of a plateful here. And, Kevin... you've been in the Veil long enough. It's time you had an upgrade. [Chuck waves his hand and Kevin transforms into soul-light, ascending through ceiling]"
11,21,Dean,Holy crap.
11,21,Sam,"Okay. So, wow, um, Chuck – [Chuckles] Well, I guess we don't call you that, huh?"
11,21,Chuck,I prefer it.
11,21,Sam,"Okay, uh, ""Chuck"" it is. [Sighs] I'm sorry. You're gonna have to, uh, give Dean and me a moment to start to process. We didn't even know you were around. I mean, we knew about Chuck, but we just didn't know about... Chuck. I mean, I-I-I was hoping you were around. I-I-I prayed and I- but I don't know if they got, uh, lost in the spam or if—"
11,21,Dean,Sam?
11,21,Sam,Yeah?
11,21,Dean,Babbling.
11,21,Sam,Okay.
11,21,Chuck,I'm getting that not everyone's totally on board.
11,21,Dean,"Here's the thing, um...Chuck... And I mean no disrespect. Um... I'm guessing you came back to help with the Darkness, and that's great. That's, you know – It's fantastic. Um, but you've been gone a – a... long, long time. And there's so much crap that has gone down on the Earth for thousands of years. I mean, plagues and wars, slaughters. And you were, I don't know, writing books, going to fan conventions. Were you even aware, o-or did you just tune it out?"
11,21,Chuck,"I was aware, Dean."
11,21,Dean,"But you did nothing. And, again, I-I'm not trying to piss you off. You know, I don't want to turn into a pillar of salt."
11,21,Chuck,I actually… didn't do that.
11,21,Dean,"Okay. People – People pray to you. People build churches for you. They fight wars in your name, and you did nothing."
11,21,Chuck,"You're frustrated. I get it. Believe me, I was hands-on – Real hands-on for, wow, ages. I was so sure if I kept stepping in, teaching, punishing, that these beautiful creatures that I created... would grow up. But it only stayed the same. And I saw that I needed to step away and let my baby find its way. Being overinvolved is no longer parenting. [Sighs] It's enabling."
11,21,Dean,But it didn't get better.
11,21,Chuck,"Well, I've been mulling it over. And from where I sit, I think it has."
11,21,Dean,"Well, from where I sit, it feels like you left us and you're trying to justify it."
11,21,Chuck,"I know you had a complicated upbringing, Dean, but don't confuse me with your dad."
11,21,Amara,"End your suffering, Lucifer. Call out to him. Beg him to save you."
11,21,Chuck,"You have to understand this about the Darkness – she's relentless, a force beyond human comprehension. It's the only reason I came off the sidelines."
11,21,Sam,"Must have been great being her brother, huh?"
11,21,Chuck,"It was the worst. Always telling me what to do, making me do what she wanted. I mean, you guys know how that works."
11,21,Dean,"So, where is she?"
11,21,Chuck,"No freakin' idea, fellas. She's warded herself specifically against me. What have you come up with?"
11,21,Dean,"Zip, and we've been at it for months."
11,21,Chuck,Well...matter of time. I've always had faith in you... ...even if you didn't return the favor. Where's the guest room? I could use a shower.
11,21,Sam,"Uh, it's, um... just down the hallway – the fourth door on the left."
11,21,Dean,"[Sighs] Hey, Chuck. You know that she's got Lucifer, right?"
11,21,Chuck,Uh-huh.
11,21,Sam,"The way we heard it, um... last time when you bottled up the Darkness, it – it took more than just you. I mean, we heard that Lucifer was involved."
11,21,Chuck,No.
11,21,Dean,No?
11,21,Chuck,"Lucifer was perhaps my greatest hope and my bitterest disappointment. Do you think if I could have trusted him for a moment, I would have put him in the Cage? And I wasn't gonna mention this, but thank you so much for springing him."
11,21,Sam,"That wasn't really the plan, um..."
11,21,Chuck,"Now, as bad as he was, after all this time in prison, he's probably worse. And by now, he could have formed an alliance with Amara. Not walking into that trap, guys. So, no. Thus spake the Lord."
11,21,Amara,Something's out there.
11,21,Casifer,"Hmm, always is."
11,21,Amara,This is new. Something's changed.
11,21,Casifer,Maybe Dad picked up on your latest slaughterfest.
11,21,Amara,"Spoiled brat. I needed solitude and he needed a fan club, so he made all that. Then when I complained, he stuffed me in a hole for eons – with your help."
11,21,Casifer,Stop whining.
11,21,Amara,"I don't need this. [swipes at Casifer with power, knocking him out]"
11,21,Dean,"[Sighs] Come on, Amara. Where are you?"
11,21,Amara,"I've missed you, Dean. It's been a while since we've spoken. I'm aware my brother has surfaced. If you should cross paths, if he should reach out to you, he should know this – Lucifer, his favorite, isn't doing so well. [Casifer appears, tortured and beaten] To say nothing of the vessel, your friend Castiel. By choosing to ignore me, my brother is allowing this to happen. These and... other things. I thought you should know. [She fades away]"
11,21,Dean,Anything?
11,21,Sam,"Nada. [accepting drink] Yeah, thanks."
11,21,Dean,Yeah.
11,21,Sam,"You know, I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but, for once, I actually wish Rowena was here. I mean, maybe she could track down Amara. She's done it before."
11,21,Dean,"Yeah, but you can bet she and the Book are gonna stay stashed until this whole thing is over. Where's Chuck?"
11,21,Sam,"[shrugs] Sleeping in, I guess."
11,21,Dean,Does God sleep?
11,21,Sam,I know he takes really long showers.
11,21,Dean,"Right, and sings, too – like, crappy old folk songs. I had to tell him to cool it three times."
11,21,Sam,You told God to cool it?
11,21,Dean,"Yeah, I sleep."
11,21,Sam,"You know, I know this is a really strange situation and all, but it's also really amazing, you know? I mean, it's God. [Chuckles] There's so many things I want to ask him, uh, like, uh, t-the planets, you know? Why are they round? Or ears. I always thought they were strange—"
11,21,Dean,"Okay, fanboy, calm down. Let's stay focused. We got to find Lucifer before it's too late."
11,21,Sam,Too late?
11,21,Dean,"Amara is – she's in my head. [Sam looks at him sharply] Hey, I didn't ask for it, okay? She just showed up. But she's showing me visions of – of Lucifer. By Lucifer, I mean Cas, and he looks like crap – like she's really doing a number on him."
11,21,Sam,[to Dean] Shh. [to Chuck as he enters room from hallway] Hey. Morning.
11,21,Dean,[does doubletake] Is that my robe?
11,21,Chuck,"I'm telling you guys, it's a mistake to get mixed up with Lucifer. Much as it pained me, I had to walk away. Too much drama. Do you have any bacon?"
11,21,Dean,You eat bacon? [grins]
11,21,Chuck,Yeah.
11,21,Sam,"Hey, guys, this just came up. Looks like that fog, the, um... Amara fog, uh, hit another town."
11,21,Dean,And?
11,21,Sam,"And this one wasn't as lucky as the last one. Thousands died. Uh, everybody died. But, uh, except for one man."
11,21,Dean,"[to Chick, with some scorn] How'd you miss that one?"
11,21,Chuck,She's baiting me. I can't respond every time. I won't be manipulated.
11,21,Dean,"Yeah, but thousands of people are dead."
11,21,Chuck,Unfortunately. So find her.
11,21,Reporter,"We have breaking news at this hour on the most recent freak weather event. State police are now confirming that a mysterious toxic fog engulfed the town of Lewis, Oklahoma, late last night."
11,21,Reporter,Reports are also confirmed there were mass fatalities. Descriptions of the event are identical to those of the fog that overwhelmed another town in the days –
11,21,Dean,[answers phone] What?
11,21,Metatron,"I notice you've been in touch with Chuck. Well, I've got some... information you're gonna need to know."
11,21,Dean,"Okay, say it."
11,21,Metatron,No. It's got to be in person – something I got to show you.
11,21,Dean,Professor Redfield. FBI.
11,21,Donatello,Call me Donatello. Yeah. I'm named after him. [Chuckles]
11,21,Dean,[slightly confused] The… Mutant Ninja Turtle?
11,21,Donatello,"The, uh, Renaissance sculptor."
11,21,Dean,"Right, of course."
11,21,Donatello,The cops think I'm a terrorist. I-I teach chemistry at the university. I-I lead a quiet life. I have a cat! Had a cat.
11,21,Sam,"Well, we are, uh, sorry for your loss. Just a few questions. Um, other than the fog, did you notice anything or anyone that seemed out of place on the street that night?"
11,21,Donatello,"It – It all happened so fast. I, uh... It was like it came out of nowhere. We hardly ever get fog, and never like that. [Chuckles] It was horrible. They were clutching their throats like- like – like they were choking. And, oh. Their bodies – oh, my God – these terrible black streaks. [flashbacks of fog incident] [Gasping] And that's when it happened. It was like nothing I've ever felt before in my life. [Screaming] It was like my head was exploding, only not with pain – with – with – with knowledge and – and clarity! Things that I'd never known before. Symbols and – and voices – in languages I don't speak! Then... horrible...[flashback of Donatello being engulfed in light and eyes glowing] horrible visions... of destruction... and death. You think I'm crazy."
11,21,Sam,"No, uh, not at all. Just, uh, you know, will you give us a moment?"
11,21,Sam,"I mean, you get that this is all sounding familiar, right?"
11,21,Dean,"Yeah. Yeah, like when Kevin found out he was a prophet. So, what, this guy's a prophet?"
11,21,Sam,"Yeah, but I thought Crowley rounded up all the future prophets and tried to kill them."
11,21,Dean,"Yeah, but we rescued them and Donatello wasn't a part of that, but, yeah, it's possible Crowley missed a few."
11,21,Sam,"And, obviously, he had no idea he was next in line after Kevin, so."
11,21,Dean,"How would he? He hadn't gotten hit by the God power yet. So, Amara's fog – could it have been Amara's God power?"
11,21,Sam,It's still God power.
11,21,Dean,"All right, I need a coffee."
11,21,Sam,Yeah.
11,21,Donatello,Um... am – am I under arrest?
11,21,Sam,"No, just, um... want to check out a few more aspects of your story. Here we go. Would you look at this? Try and read it a little."
11,21,Donatello,"Oh, I can't. I – I don't know anything about it. [looks at paper and enochian symbols a moment] ""Behold the face of God"" [Looking in shock to Sam] That came right to me. Who speaks this language?"
11,21,Sam,Angels.
11,21,Amara,"I need to see you, Dean. Events are moving swiftly and everything will change. I need to meet with you, but not like this. Somewhere alone."
11,21,Donatello,"I can't be a prophet. I'm an atheist and a chemist! I-I believe in molecules, not God."
11,21,Dean,"All right, well, we're pretty sure that prophets don't even know they're in the game until they've actually been touched by God, so..."
11,21,Donatello,I-I was touched by God?
11,21,Dean,"Or possibly his sister, Amara."
11,21,Donatello,He has family?
11,21,Sam,Yeah. She wants him gone so she can annihilate the universe. That's the headline.
11,21,Donatello,What?
11,21,Dean,"And since you might have a hotline to her, we're hoping you can help us find her."
11,21,Donatello,W-Why would you want to find her?
11,21,Sam,We got to rescue this guy she's holding.
11,21,Donatello,Who is it?
11,21,Dean,Lucifer
11,21,Sam,her nephew.
11,21,Dean,Who's possessing an angel at the moment.
11,21,Sam,Yeah.
11,21,Donatello,Oh.
11,21,Sam,It's locked.
11,21,Dean,"Yeah, that, too. Sometimes we keep monsters in the back."
11,21,Donatello,I – I – I can't do this!
11,21,Dean,"Yeah, you can."
11,21,Donatello,"No, I promise you I can't."
11,21,Dean,"Look, we can't force you to do this. You've got to want this."
11,21,Donatello,It – It's like asking me to believe in Santa Claus.
11,21,Dean,"Oh, well, actually –"
11,21,Sam,"Dean, not now."
11,21,Dean,"Okay, look, we – we're not asking you to believe that this is true, just act like you do. People do it all the time."
11,21,Sam,What?
11,21,Donatello,I – I-I don't know. I – I think I'm sensing something. Something big.
11,21,Sam,Like Amara?
11,21,Donatello,"I don't think so. Although, how would I know? [Sighs] Could it be... Him?"
11,21,Dean,"Hey, Chuck. We, uh, found someone. I think he's the next prophet."
11,21,Chuck,Neat-o.
11,21,Dean,Is that my computer?
11,21,Chuck,I've never seen so much porn. Not in one sitting.
11,21,Dean,"It's – I'm gonna... [Dean carefully closes laptop] So, uh, listen. He – He's – He's a little nutted out about the whole booga-booga of it all, so maybe just dial back the – the God stuff."
11,21,Dean,[shakes head] No pants on. [turning to staircase] Sam?
11,21,Sam,Yeah?
11,21,Dean,Yeah.
11,21,Sam,"All right, you're safe. Come on. [to Donatello]"
11,21,Chuck,"[Sighs] Donatello, good to see ya. Sorry about your cat."
11,21,Donatello,You – You know me?
11,21,Chuck,"I made you. I made all of you, even the ones who aren't born yet."
11,21,Donatello,"Oh, my God. It's you. G-Good to meet you, Sir! Your – Your celestial magnificence, your –"
11,21,Chuck,"Hey, hey, hey, it's okay."
11,21,Sam,He – He just kind of goes by Chuck.
11,21,Chuck,"So, we good? Y'all signed up?"
11,21,Donatello,"Uh...I-I-I guess you know that I was an atheist, until 10 minutes ago. Is that an issue?"
11,21,Chuck,"Not for me. I mean, I believe in me. But your skepticism is to be expected. I did include free will in the kit. [Chuckles] [Clicks tongue] Welcome aboard."
11,21,Metatron,"Oh, uh, barkeep, dos margaritas! Top-shelf tequila please for my amigos. Their treat."
11,21,Sam,All right. We're here. Don't try to pull any crap.
11,21,Metatron,And what variety of crap could I possibly pull? I've lost my grace. Look at me. I got nothing.
11,21,Dean,"Okay, why did you have to see us? What's so urgent?"
11,21,Metatron,"[Sighs] So, I, uh, notice you've been in touch with Chuck. A.K.A., you know who."
11,21,Sam,"Yeah, yeah. Is this going anywhere? Yes, Chuck agreed to take on Amara."
11,21,Metatron,He said that? Used those words?
11,21,Sam,Pretty much.
11,21,Metatron,Huh.
11,21,Sam,"So, what – he's not confronting Amara?"
11,21,Metatron,"Oh, no. No, no, no. He's – He's going to – He's gonna...meet with her. He's just not gonna take her down. He's gonna... sacrifice himself. Let her do whatever she wants with him."
11,21,Sam,Do you really expect us to buy this?
11,21,Metatron,"No. Of course not. Here. Buy this. [Tosses manuscript onto table in front of Sam with loud Thud] Ignore the typos, but read it. It's in his own words. It's not an autobiography. It's a suicide note."
11,21,Chuck,"You wanted to talk. This seemed as good a place as any. [watching boy playing in sandbox with blocks] Look at him – endlessly optimistic. The wind blows over his tower, he rebuilds. Always gets me."
11,21,Dean,"If that's so, why are you bailing? When you see Amara, you're throwing in the towel?"
11,21,Chuck,[Sighs] Metatron. Loose lips. But you think I'm a dick. Why do you care?
11,21,Dean,Because before you went M.I.A... you did a lot.
11,21,Chuck,"Thank you. And what you call throwing in the towel, I call strategy."
11,21,Dean,How is death by your sister a strategy?
11,21,Chuck,I know her. Her beef is with me.
11,21,Dean,"Yeah, but I still don't understand how – how dying is a – a blueprint for success."
11,21,Chuck,I won't be dying. I'll be caged. I trade myself for... everything I created. It goes on.
11,21,Dean,"Okay, well, the, um, Amara that I know is... a mountain of – of pissed off. I mean, she spent a – a gazillion years in solitary. The only thing she's thinking is – is it's her turn."
11,21,Chuck,"And I'll give it to her, as long as she accepts the deal."
11,21,Dean,"The deal? What... She's gonna eliminate you, and then she's gonna destroy everything that you've created. She's told me this personally. [Sighs] You started this. You started all of this, but does that give you the right to end it? You know, we're not just some toys you throw away. I think you owe us more than that."
11,21,Chuck,"If my plan doesn't work, then humans will step up. You, Sam, others that are the chosen will have to find a way. It's why I saved you years ago. You're the firewall between light and darkness."
11,21,Dean,"No. No, I... Look, give me a – a vampire, and I'm good. But this – God's sister? That is way above my pay grade. I... It... Bottom line is i-it's you who has to take her out. And look, then after that, you know, get a condo in Cancun. I don't care!"
11,21,Dean,I got you a beer. I don't know if you drink.
11,21,Donatello,I do now.
11,21,Dean,Well... [Sighs] I don't know... if Chuck is leaning our way.
11,21,Donatello,You don't know?
11,21,Dean,"If we do get Lucifer for the added muscle, then...maybe he'll play ball."
11,21,Donatello,I thought they hated each other.
11,21,Dean,"Yeah, they do."
11,21,Donatello,Wow. I so miss being an atheist.
11,21,Sam,"All right, Metatron. Make it quick. Don't touch anything."
11,21,Metatron,Fine. Dean! Thanks for inviting me.
11,21,Dean,Inviting you? You've been circling the building all night. You sent me 200 text messages with dumbass emojis. You got three minutes.
11,21,Metatron,"Oh. Donatello! Pleasure to meet you. Metatron, scribe of God. I was there when you were designed. I wrote your name on the inside of the angels' eyelids."
11,21,Donatello,He's freaking me out.
11,21,Dean,"Okay. You said you wanted to help. Besides world-class douchery, what do you have to offer?"
11,21,Metatron,"Oh, nothing. I just transcribed the angel tablet and know all the spells. And I know what makes Amara tick. And I had a relationship with the big guy for eons. Shall I keep going?"
11,21,Sam,Ah! That's mine! [takes beer from Metatron] [Turning to Dean] As much as I hate to admit this... he kind of has a point.
11,21,Dean,I don't know.
11,21,Metatron,[Scoffs] You need all the help you can get – even douche help.
11,21,Dean,And since when did you jump on the God wagon? You never used to give a damn.
11,21,Metatron,"Well, I didn't – at one time. Now that he's gone all kamikaze, leaving us with the Darkness, I... [Sighs] I was by his side since the creation. He believed in me. If there's something I can do to help save him and his creation, then... ...uh, it seems like I should."
11,21,Dean,The plan is to rescue Lucifer from Amara. Then he teleports us out of Amara's hideout and we convince Chuck to use him to fight her.
11,21,Metatron,[Scoffs] That's your plan? Do you even know where Amara is?
11,21,Donatello,"Um, I think I might know where she is. I've been getting this vibe. Uh, it's like a ping in my cerebral cortex."
11,21,Metatron,"Oh, so either Amara or a stroke.  And how are we supposed to keep Amara busy while we're... liberating Lucifer?"
11,21,Amara,"Thank you for reaching out to me, Dean."
11,21,Dean,You said you wanted to meet.
11,21,Amara,I missed you. And the... sensations you arouse. I know you feel the same way. So...what do we do?
11,21,Dean,There can be no us. We should just walk away.
11,21,Amara,Then why don't you?
11,21,Casifer,"Oh, goody. Larry, Curly, Moe. Search and rescue? Oh, wow. [to Donatello] It's one of Dad's favorites. Your ticket finally got punched, huh? It's wacky, isn't it? One minute, you're...nobody. And then – Shazam – you're Joan of Arc. Let's, uh – Let's hope this ends better than that."
11,21,Sam,"All right, can the small talk. We're busting you out of here."
11,21,Casifer,"Well, it seems fair since I wouldn't be here if you lunatics hadn't set me up to be grabbed by Amara."
11,21,Sam,"You're gonna help us take her down. If you say no, we'll just leave you here in Abu Ghraib."
11,21,Casifer,"[Chuckles, coughs] Say no? You see what she's done to me? Do I look like a fan?!"
11,21,Amara,"This place, this world hasn't been especially easy for you. Why not at least consider my offer?"
11,21,Dean,This world is flawed. I will give you that. But I am not ready to say goodbye to it just yet.
11,21,Amara,"But one way or the other, you will. It's inevitable. My brother won't stop me again, because he can't. Dean, give up your... smallness, your humanity and become boundless within me."
11,21,Metatron,"Eeroh, mahday saytah!"
11,21,Casifer,Did you grab this from the steno pool?
11,21,Sam,You understand you'll be working with your father. Is that gonna be a problem?
11,21,Casifer,[Groans] That's family. This is bigger.
11,21,Sam,"So, you'll table all the old stuff?"
11,21,Casifer,What happens in Heaven stays in Heaven.
11,21,Metatron,"[chanting in concentration] Kahtoh, mahday, tayroh!"
11,21,Sam,"Metatron, are we getting any closer? Dean can't stall forever."
11,21,Metatron,I'm – I'm – I'm narrowing it down.
11,21,Dean,"You're right. I am drawn to you. And it bothers the hell out of me, 'cause I can't control it."
11,21,Amara,Then why fight it? What you're feeling is that I am the end of your struggle. Something stops you. Keeps you from having it all.
11,21,Metatron,"Sahboh, taylah!"
11,21,Casifer,"Oh, oh! Yes."
11,21,Amara,Where are your thoughts? Something's different.
11,21,Sam,"Hey, Lucifer, zap us out of here – quick!"
11,21,Casifer,"Oh, no can do."
11,21,Sam,What do you mean you can't do it?
11,21,Casifer,Temporarily grounded. Equipment malfunction.
11,21,Amara,[backing away from Dean] You've spoken with God. You've seen him. You betrayed me.
11,21,Donatello,"Guys, I'm – I'm feeling her! She's coming!"
11,21,Sam,"All right, we're out of here. [lifting Casifer, arm thrown over his shoulder] Okay. Come on."
11,21,Sam,"All right, Metatron, come on."
11,21,Metatron,"It's okay, Sam. You go."
11,21,Sam,What?! Come on!
11,21,Metatron,I'm serious. I got this.
11,21,Amara,"The secretary. [Metatron activates spell] You were kidding with that, weren't you?"
11,21,Metatron,He meant well. Spare the universe.
11,21,Amara,"Spare this. [She blasts Metatron with power, and he is sucked away into portal, then gone]"
11,21,Amara,You really aren't worth sparing. None of you. [she raises her arms to strike]
11,21,Donatello,What happened?!
11,21,Donatello,Where are we?
11,21,Sam,[entering maptable room – Scoffs] Home.
11,21,Chuck,"[Entering room, Sighs] Occasionally, I do answer a prayer."
11,21,Chuck,[looking at Casifer] [Sighs] You've changed.
11,21,Casifer,You've changed.
11,21,Chuck,"Well, still... I'm really pretty much the same."
11,21,Dean,"Still twitchy, huh? Now, you've met God, Lucifer and the Darkness. You're gonna need a spa day."
11,21,Donatello,[Chuckles]
11,21,Dean,"That or a pair of hookers. [bitchface from Sam, Dean smirks]"
11,21,Donatello,"Ah, I have to sort it all out to see what comes next. I don't feel much like returning to academia and... I sure as hell can't go back to being an atheist."
11,21,Dean,"Yeah, I hear you."
11,21,Donatello,"Thank you... I guess. And, uh... if there is a tomorrow... Given your line of work, I'll probably see you again."
11,21,Sam,"Stay tuned, we may need you."
11,21,Dean,[to Sam] So Metatron took one for the team.
11,21,Sam,Yeah.
11,21,Dean,"Well, I wouldn't have called that."
11,21,Sam,"[Sighs] So, you want to tell me about it? [Dean looks at him in question] I mean Amara obviously figured out something was going on and... she didn't rip your head off."
11,21,Dean,"She wants me to be a part of her. Not metaphorically, I'm talking literally. Forever. So in other words…. adios. [Dean turns and walks away, Sam watching in concern, follows]"

12,1,INTERIOR,TONI OPENS THE DOOR AND WALKS DOWN THE STAIRS.  SAM’S RGHT FOOT HAS BEEN BURNED BY THE BLOW TORCH.  SAM GROANS WEAKLY.
12,1,INTERIOR,"GREGORY IS SITTING IN FRONT OF HIS DESK WITH CASTIEL, DEAN, AND MARY STANDING BEFORE HIM."
12,1,INTERIOR,"SAM COMES OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS. HE FINDS HIMSELF ON THE FLOOR, UNCHAINED, AND SITS UP.  CLEARLY IN PAIN, SAM LOOKS AT HIS FOOT THAT HAS BEEN WRAPPED.  HE LOOKS AROUND REALIZING HE’S ALONE IN THE CELLAR.  HE TOUCHES HIS NECK AND FEELS A NEEDLE PUNCTURE. LOOKING UP HE SPOTS A CAMERA AND REALIZES HE’S BEING WATCHED.  THE VIEW SWITCHES TO A MONITOR WHERE TONI AND MS WATTS ARE WATCHING SAM."
12,1,EXTERIOR DAY,"DEAN AND MARY, IN THE FRONT SEAT, DRIVE OFF WITH CASTIEL."
12,1,INTERIOR,SAM IS LIMPING AROUND THE CELLAR.  HE RATTLES THE OUTSIDE CELLAR DOOR WHICH IS CHAINED SHUT.
12,1,EXTERIOR DAY,DEAN IS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND WE LOOK INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE IMPALA.
12,1,INTERIOR,IN THE CELLAR OF THE FARM HOUSE SAM IS STILL HEARING HIGH PITCHED RINGING.   HE DROPS TO HIS KNEES AND LOOKS UP TO SEE A HALLUCINATION OF JESSICA BURNING ON THE CEILING.  TONI KEEPS WATCH ON THE MONITOR.

12,2,TONI,"No. No, they work for us. Tools. They kill. They don't think."

12,2,DEAN,"All right. I don't know. You know, check... real-estate offices. See if anybody bought a place or rented a place. I mean, these people had a freakin' plane. Maybe they do things legit."
12,2,CASTIEL,"Okay, I understand. I'll call you in the morning."
12,2,DEAN,"Cass, hey. So, here's the thing. It's been kind of weird here with, you know, Mom being back. It's like we don't know how to act around each other, so we just kind of make this small talk and act normal, but it's – it's so not normal."
12,2,CASTIEL,"Um, I'm – I'm not sure. What – what has she said to you?"
12,2,DEAN,"Well, nothing. That – that – that's the whole point."
12,2,CASTIEL,"Okay, what have you said to her?"
12,2,DEAN,"Well, nothing. I'm – I don't know what to say to her, you know? It – it's – it's like it's all just too much, and...I don't want to overwhelm her."
12,2,CASTIEL,"Don't make things needlessly complicated, as you humans tend to do. I'll call you."
12,2,DEAN,Yeah. Great. That's helpful. Thanks.
12,2,MARY,Any news on Sam?
12,2,DEAN,"Um, so somewhere outsi– here. Somewhere outside of Aldrich, Missouri. Cass is going through it with a fine-toothed comb, and I've cracked every database I could."
12,2,MARY,Every what?
12,2,DEAN,Right. No Internet your first time around.
12,2,MARY,Our house didn't have an electric typewriter. So...are you really afraid of overwhelming me?
12,2,DEAN,"Mom, look, I am... thrilled that you're back. I mean, I'm so damn happy, I-I-I can't even stand it."
12,2,MARY,"I just... it's just gonna take me a second to catch up, you know?"
12,2,DEAN,"Yeah, no, no. Look, take – take all the time you need, all right? It's – it is what it is."
12,2,MARY,And when we do find Sam... how am I gonna face him?
12,2,DEAN,What do you mean?
12,2,MARY,That yellow-eyed thing would never have come for him that night if I... I started all of this.
12,2,INTERIOR,SAM IS LAYING ON HIS STOMACH WITH TONI BEHIND HIM STROKING HIS BACK.
12,2,TONI,"It's just surprising that for all your efforts, yours and all the Hunters, monsters remain rampant in this country."
12,2,SAM,"Yeah, we just, uh – just keep plugging away, I guess."
12,2,TONI,Do you ever think – and don't take this the wrong way – that some of your soldiers may have been compromised? Or bought.
12,2,SAM,"I mean... No, I-I don't, um..."
12,2,TONI,Is everything all right?
12,2,SAM,No!
12,2,TONI,Is everything all right?
12,2,SAM,"No! I shouldn't – I shouldn't be talking to you. 
THE SCENE SWITCHES BETWEEN THE CELLAR AND THE BEDROOM AND END IN THE CELLAR WHEN SAM RAISES HIS HEAD.  SAM IS CHAINED AND IN THE CHAIR.  TONI IS SITTING IN HER USUAL SPOT."
12,2,TONI,"You'll have to admit, it was fun while it lasted."
12,2,SAM,What did you do to me?
12,2,TONI,"An hallucination created by potion and powerful spell work. So...was it good for you? Hm. Sadly, I can't do the spell again. Your brain would liquefy, which we don't want. Yet. So... I'll have to resort to less... pleasant methods."
12,2,TONI,Enhanced interrogation was never part of my job description.
12,2,TONI,But as it turns out... ...I'm a quick study.
12,2,INTERIOR,"BUNKER, DEAN IS SITTING IN KITCHEN IN FRONT OF THE LAPTOP WHEN MARY WALKS IN."
12,2,DEAN,"Hey, how'd you sleep?"
12,2,MARY,I had dreams all night.
12,2,DEAN,Good dreams?
12,2,MARY,Stuff I'd forgotten about. Funny stuff your dad did. He was a great father.
12,2,DEAN,"Hey, Cass, what do you got?"
12,2,EXTERIOR,"DAY, CASTIEL IS STANDING SLIGHTLY BEHIND A VERY LEAFY TREE."
12,2,CASTIEL,"I think I may have found Sam's location. It's a farm. It appears empty, but it was rented two weeks ago to a woman with an English accent."
12,2,DEAN,Did you have a look inside?
12,2,CASTIEL,"No No, it's – it's powerfully warded."
12,2,DEAN,"Powerfully warded? Okay, see, buddy, that – that was your headline right there."
12,2,CASTIEL,Are we still discussing the same thing?
12,2,DEAN,Where are you?
12,2,CASTIEL,I'll text you the address.
12,2,DEAN,"Okay, got it. I'm on my way."
12,2,MARY,I'll get my coat.
12,2,DEAN,"Wait. Uh Okay. Why don't I take this one solo, okay? We just – we don't know what we're walking into here."
12,2,MARY,We never know. We're Hunters.
12,2,DEAN,"Right. Um... Okay, I-I can't do my job if I'm worried about you."
12,2,MARY,"Dean. You won't have to be. I can handle myself. Okay? All right, good talk."
12,2,DEAN,"Oh, boy."
12,2,INTERIOR,WATER IS THROWN INTO SAM’S FACE.
12,2,TONI,"Good morning, Sam. Let's start again, shall we? Take our time. I've cleared my calendar. I would like names and locations of every Hunter... the passcodes to each and every Men of Letters database held in the bunker, and then – oh, yes –  let's do discuss your relationship with the demon Ruby."
12,2,TONI,Mick.
12,2,EXTERIOR,"DAY, MICK IS WALKING AROUND MS. WATT’S CAR.  SHE’S LAYING INSIDE."
12,2,MICK,"You've been a bad girl, Toni. And I've come to fetch you."
12,2,TONI,I have Sam Winchester. He's close to breaking. Just leave me be.
12,2,MICK,"No can do. You disobeyed orders. Oh, and you should know, your Ms. Watt – quite dead. Courtesy of Dean Winchester and friends."
12,2,INTERIOR,INSIDE A RESTAURANT.  ROWENA IS SITTING AT A TABLE WITH A MAN.
12,2,ROWENA,"Sent me to the grandest boarding schools, but I was a wee imp and ran away for a life in the arts. Mother didn't speak to me until I became a star."
12,2,BEN,A star? Of?
12,2,ROWENA,"Uh, do you follow the Royal Ballet?"
12,2,BEN,Not a bit.
12,2,ROWENA,The Royal Ballet.
12,2,BEN,"You know, it reminds me a lot of my story. I left school to work in a steel mill. I rose up through the ranks, and now I own half a dozen."
12,2,ROWENA,You're not serious?
12,2,CROWLEY,"More wine, madam?"
12,2,ROWENA,You're like a boil that keeps coming back no matter how many times I have it lanced.
12,2,CROWLEY,"Let me guess. Your dinner date is loaded, single, and possibly in delicate health."
12,2,ROWENA,What of it?
12,2,CROWLEY,"Well, just a stab, but you probably don't want me to reveal that his snookums is 300 years old and a witch."
12,2,ROWENA,"Fergus, the man treats me like a queen. It's my chance to leave behind monsters and demons and moldy hideouts. So help me, if you muck this up."
12,2,CROWLEY,"Oh, I wouldn't dream of it, Mummy... if you do me one tiny favor. Help me with Lucifer."
12,2,ROWENA,Lucifer?
12,2,CROWLEY,I have a score to settle.
12,2,INTERIOR,THERE’S THE SOUND OF CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.  HARD ROCK MUSIC IS PLAYING.  THE CAMERA PULLS BACK AND WE SEE A LOGO FOR VINCE VINCENTE’S WORLD TOUR.THE BAND BECOMES VISIBLE AS THE SONG ENDS AND THE CROWD CHEERS.
12,2,ANNOUNCER,"Let's hear it for Vince Vincente and the rest of the band! See you the next time around. Good night, Cleveland!"
12,2,WOMAN #1,Whoo! I love you guys!
12,2,ANNOUNCER,"Good night, Cleveland! We love you!"
12,2,TOMMY,"Hey, Vinny, we're hitting the town tonight. Come with us. Check out the wonders of Cleveland."
12,2,VINCE,"Yeah, um... I'm good, thanks."
12,2,BAND MEMBER,"Tommy, Tommy, come on!"
12,2,TOMMY,"Yeah. Hey, I'll catch up with you guys later."
12,2,TOMMY,"Dude, you – You got to start living your life, man. You perform, you drink, you sleep, perform, drink."
12,2,VINCE,I-I get it. I get it.
12,2,TOMMY,"Look. Vince, it's been years since Jen died. All I mean, brother, is, don't you think she'd want more for you than just –"
12,2,VINCE,"Get out of here, Tommy. Go see Cleveland."
12,2,EXTERIOR,"NIGHT, THE IMPALA IS DRIVING AWAY FROM THE CAMERA.  THE SCENE CHANGES TO THE INSIDE OF THE IMPALA."
12,2,MARY,I'm your mother. You have to do what I say. Look. They targeted the bunker. They obviously know a lot about you and Sam. They'll be expecting you. I'm the last person they'd expect.
12,2,DEAN,"You were good at this, weren't you?"
12,2,MARY,"Very. The thing is, Hunters... no matter how good they are, they all end up the same way."
12,2,DEAN,"You know when you died, it changed Dad. I mean, he was Hell-bent on finding out what happened. The Hunter life, it just took him over. I guess I was the same. But Sammy – Sammy, he was different. He wanted out. He went to school. He went to Stanford."
12,2,MARY,Sam had a chance to get out? And he came back?
12,2,DEAN,"When Dad disappeared, Sam and I looked around, and something became very clear. That the only thing we had in this world – the only thing, aside from this car – was each other."
12,2,INTERIOR,"VINCE OPENS THE DOOR TO HIS ROOM AND ENTERS.  THERE ARE SEVERAL PICTURES OF JEN.  VINCE GOES INTO THE BATHROOM AND TURNS ON THE WATER.  THE WATER RUNS OVER VINCE'S HANDS AS HE LOOKS INTO THE MIRROR.  THE WATER CHANGES TO BLOOD.  NOT LOOKING, VINCE BRINGS HIS HANDS TO HIS FACE AND WIPES.  HE OPENS HIS EYES TO SEE THE BLOOD ON HIS FACE AND SCREAMS."
12,2,INTERIOR,VINCE’S HOTEL ROOM.  VINCE LOOKS AROUND THE CORNER INTO THE BATHROOM.  THE WATER IS STILL RUNNING BUT IT’S JUST HOT WATER. VINCE CHECKS HIS FACE TO FIND NO BLOOD.  THE ELECTRICITY CRACKLES AND LIGHTS BEGIN TO FLICKER.  VINCE MOVES TOWARDS THE LIVING ROOM AND TURNS THE LIGHTS ON AND OFF. THEY’VE STOPPED FLICKERING.  THUNDER CRASHES IN LOUDLY.  THE TV TURNS ON BUT JUST SHOWS STATIC.
12,2,FEMALE VOICE,Vince. Vince.
12,2,VINCE,"Hello, front desk? Hello?"
12,2,FEMALE VOICE,Vince. Vince.
12,2,FEMALE VOICE,Vince. Vince.
12,2,VINCE,No. Jen.
12,2,JEN,"Yes, Vince."
12,2,VINCE,How? Why?
12,2,JEN,I needed to say I'm sorry. Swallowing those pills was selfish.
12,2,VINCE,I've had to live all these years knowing how I treated you.
12,2,JEN,"At the time, leaving you seemed fair since you left me so many times."
12,2,VINCE,All I want is you.
12,2,JEN,"That can happen, Vince."
12,2,VINCE,What can happen?
12,2,JEN,You and me together.
12,2,VINCE,Are you a ghost?
12,2,JEN,No. I'm an angel.
12,2,VINCE,Those are real?
12,2,JEN,"Real and very powerful, Vince. I can take away your pain. Bring you peace. You only have to do one easy thing."
12,2,VINCE,What?
12,2,JEN,Will you invite me in?
12,2,VINCE,Yes.
12,2,INTERIOR,SCENE CHANGES TO ROWENA IN A ROOM LIGHT BY CANDLES.  SHE’S STANDING IN FRONT OF A TABLE WITH HER HANDS HOVERING ON THE SIDES OF A CRYSTAL BALL.
12,2,ROWENA,Ostende illum mihi quen quaero.
12,2,CROWLEY,What's the bloody hold-up? He's the one and only Satan in the phonebook.
12,2,ROWENA,"It's witchcraft, not Google Maps. And normally I'd have a piece of hair or a belonging to lock on to. You don't even know what he looks like!"
12,2,CROWLEY,He has an aura. Supreme evil. Lo on to that. Do I have to do everything?
12,2,ROWENA,I can't believe I'm once again down some dank hole seeking the devil! When does it end? It's exactly why I'm retiring to Boca Raton. With Ben.
12,2,CROWLEY,Ben? Who makes oatmeal look fascinating.
12,2,ROWENA,"He's successful, stable, and I'll outlive him."
12,2,CROWLEY,Lucifer?
12,2,ROWENA,I think so. Yes. I'll give you the location.
12,2,CROWLEY,"No, no, no. Not now. I just want to know who we're dealing with before we attack."
12,2,ROWENA,"By ""we,"" I presume you mean the Winchesters and their pet angel?"
12,2,CROWLEY,I don't need them. Just you.
12,2,CROWLEY,"Look, it's obvious. We got to put Lucifer back in the cage. You're the only one that can do it."
12,2,ROWENA,"Should've known. No, Fergus! I'll not be involved in that nonsense again!"
12,2,CROWLEY,"Maybe I should tell Ben about you. Maybe just kill him. Either way, it's bye-bye, Boca."
12,2,ROWENA,"You are a hateful snake. In any case, Lucifer can't be sent back to the cage while he's in a vessel."
12,2,CROWLEY,He won't be. Not by the time we're ready.
12,2,INTERIOR,IN THE CELLAR SAM HAS BEEN BLOODIED BY TONI’S KNIFE.  THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO SHOW HIM ALONE IN THE CELLAR.
12,2,EXTERIOR,"DAY, OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE.  THE IMPALA PULLS UP.  CASTIEL IS LEANING AGAINST THE TRUCK.  DEAN AND MARY EXIT THE IMPALA AND WALK UP TO CASTIEL."
12,2,DEAN,Where's all this warding you mentioned?
12,2,CASTIEL,It's cloaked. It's very powerful. You brought your mother?
12,2,MARY,"Hello, Castiel. Yes, he did."
12,2,DEAN,You sure there's anyone inside?
12,2,CASTIEL,"No. The agent said the lease was handled long distance, but someone warded the house."
12,2,DEAN,I'm gonna go have a closer look.
12,2,DEAN,"Mom, I got this."
12,2,MARY,"You can keep me from driving, Dean. Not from hunting."
12,2,CASTIEL,I'm locked out by the warding. I could use the company.
12,2,DEAN,Thanks.
12,2,INTERIOR,HALLWAY OF VINCE’S HOTEL.  TOMMY KNOCKS ON THE DOOR.
12,2,TOMMY,"Dude, it's noon. Let me in. Whoa. Look at you."
12,2,TOMMY,"Pretty dressed up for rehearsal, don't you think?"
12,2,LUCIFER,Rehearsal.
12,2,TOMMY,"Brother, are you okay?"
12,2,LUCIFER,"Yeah, I just can't make it to rehearsal."
12,2,TOMMY,"Yeah, you got better plans?"
12,2,LUCIFER,I do.
12,2,TOMMY,"Vince, I'm serious."
12,2,VINCE,So am I.
12,2,TOMMY,"All right. Look, stop screwing around."
12,2,VINCE,I said I had plans.
12,2,EXTERIOR,"THE FARMHOUSE.  DEAN IS WALKING OUTSIDE AND HEARS A THUD IN THE DISTANCE.  HE GOES TO INVESTIGATE AND ENDS UP OUTSIDE THE CELLAR.  HE TRIES TO OPEN IT, LOOKS UP, AND STEPS ONTO A SYMBOL THAT BEGINS TO GLOW."
12,2,DEAN,Son of a bitch.
12,2,INTERIOR,"TONI OPENS THE DOOR TO THE CELLAR.  BREATHING HEAVILY, SAM LOOKS UP AT HER."
12,2,SAM,Screw yourself.
12,2,SAM,Dean.
12,2,TONI,"I'm as happy to see him as you are, 'cause while you may be able to withstand my snapping apart your body joint by joint, can you watch it happen to Dean?"
12,2,INTERIOR,SCREAMS ARE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE AS LUCIFER WALKS DOWN THE HALL.  HE ENTERS HELL’S THRONE ROOM TO SEE CROWLEY SITTING ON THE THRONE READING A COMIC BOOK.
12,2,LUCIFER,They told me you'd be here.
12,2,CROWLEY,Really?
12,2,LUCIFER,"Get off my furniture, squatter."
12,2,CROWLEY,"Lucifer. Wearing Vince Vincente, second-tier star. I would've thought Bieber was more your style."
12,2,LUCIFER,You're either mad or dim.
12,2,CROWLEY,"I have a proposal. I mean, why in Hell would you want to rule over a motley, witless crew of demons? God's on sabbatical again. You could reclaim Heaven. Now, that's real estate that's worth ruling. I can handle the branch office."
12,2,LUCIFER,"Hmm. Or...I could raise my hand, smite you into oblivion."
12,2,ROWENA,Manete. Manete. Manete. Manete. Manete. Manete. Manete.
12,2,CROWLEY,Problem?
12,2,ROWENA,Manete. Manete. Manete. Manete.
12,2,CROWLEY,"Mummy's little paralyzing spell. Trust me, it works."
12,2,LUCIFER,Trust me.
12,2,LUCIFER,Not for long.
12,2,CROWLEY,Oh...
12,2,CROWLEY,"Well, actually, it's top-shelf sulfuric acid. Harmless to you, I know, but to your vessel, not so much."
12,2,INTERIOR,"THE CELLAR, TONI LOOKS OVER HER TORTURE TOOLS AND PICKS UP BRASS KNUCKLES.  SHE WALKS OVER AND SLUGS DEAN."
12,2,TONI,"Passcodes, Sam. Not yet?"
12,2,TONI,Anything to add?
12,2,DEAN,"No. No, I just came by for some tea and a beating."
12,2,TONI,PUTS DOWN THE BRASS KNUCKLES AND PICKS UP A CUP OF TEA.
12,2,TONI,"Really? See, I thought you might be on for a little chat about your mate, Benjamin Lafitte. I'm sorry. You called him Benny. You know, the vampire whom you released from Purgatory and befriended. I see. Well... the English are nothing if not patient."
12,2,INTERIOR,"HELL, LUCIFER SCREAMS AS THE ACID DISSOLVES HIS FACE."
12,2,CROWLEY,"Now. His essence, send it back to the cage."
12,2,ROWENA,"Wah tay, fay roh lah!"
12,2,CROWLEY,Mother!
12,2,ROWENA,Manete! Manete! Manete!
12,2,CROWLEY,It's not working.
12,2,ROWENA,Manete! Manete!
12,2,LUCIFER,"Bad, bad Crowley."
12,2,ROWENA,Seriously?
12,2,LUCIFER,You spoil that boy.
12,2,INTERIOR,THE CELLAR.
12,2,SAM,Dean.
12,2,DEAN,Hey.
12,2,SAM,I thought you were dead.
12,2,DEAN,I'm not sure that I'm not.
12,2,SAM,So?
12,2,DEAN,"I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything, okay? First off, who's Angry Spice?"
12,2,SAM,"She, uh – she's – she's Men of Letters. Uh, British Men of Letters."
12,2,DEAN,Is that a thing? What the hell? Aren't we supposed to be on the same team?
12,2,DEAN,"Oh, God."
12,2,TONI,"Gentlemen. So, to recap – you live in the Men of Letters bunker, awash in the world's greatest collection of occult knowledge, and yet you know ""nothing."""
12,2,DEAN,Right. What a waste.
12,2,TONI,"It seems you apes have never read a single book. The Men of Letters has a long tradition of intellectual excellence. In London, we've undertaken exhaustive studies of even the most arcane topics."
12,2,TONI,"For example, parts of the body most sensitive to intense pain."
12,2,TONI,"The ear drum. Decaying tooth. Below the belt, of course. And my favorite – under the eyelid."
12,2,TONI,Did you know it's possible to die from pain?
12,2,MARY,Get away from my boys.
12,2,SAM,Mom?
12,2,DEAN,Yeah.
12,2,MARY,Drop it. Ground.
12,2,MARY,That's the ground.
12,2,DEAN,Holy crap.
12,2,TONI,Xi.
12,2,DEAN,Kill the spell now. I'm not kidding.
12,2,TONI,"Shoot me, and your mother has no chance."
12,2,TONI,The gun.
12,2,SAM,Dean!
12,2,DEAN,It's okay. She was using a Chinese mind-control technique. Hard to do when you're unconscious. Turns out this ape did read a book or two.
12,2,MICK,Well played.
12,2,MICK,"What you were told is basically true. We were keen on knowing about the two of you, seeing as you seem to be partially carrying on the Men of Letters' work here now that the American chapter is defunct."
12,2,DEAN,"So you sic your attack dog on us to what, say hi?"
12,2,MICK,"Well, part of our group suspect some kind of malfeasance amongst you American Hunters. No argument – Lady Bevell went too far. I deeply apologize."
12,2,SAM,Mm.
12,2,MICK,She'll face consequences in London.
12,2,DEAN,"I'll tell you what, why don't you take a walk, and she can face those consequences right here and now?"
12,2,MICK,"She's ours. We'll take care of her. Now, I'm here to extend an olive branch. We want to work with you."
12,2,SAM,"Let me ask you a question, uh, Mick is it? Why would we believe any of this?"
12,2,MICK,"Lads...if I wasn't sincere, if I meant you harm, there's a dozen ways I could've come in here and taken you all prisoner instead of being unarmed. Not to mention I powered down all the wardings in this shack so your attack dog could come in. I reckon you could finish me off without breaking a sweat. Am I right?"
12,2,CASTIEL,I don't sweat under any circumstances.
12,2,MICK,My number.
12,2,MICK,"Take your time, cool down, and just think it over. And what have you got to lose, except your worst nightmares?"
12,2,INTERIOR,BUNKER AT THE MAP TABLE.  THERE’S A BUCKET OF SANDY’S CHICKEN TO GO ON THE TABLE AND IT’S CLEAR THE WINCHESTERS JUST FINISHED A MEAL.
12,2,DEAN,"Oh, that was fantastic. Thank you, Mom."
12,2,MARY,"All I did was point at some stuff on a take-out menu. I would've cooked, but I, uh...don't."
12,2,DEAN,"Well, now, wait. Your meat loaf was amazing."
12,2,MARY,Came from the Piggly Wiggly. Sorry to burst your bubble.
12,2,MARY,But do you still like pie?
12,2,DEAN (CHUCKLES),I mean...
12,2,MARY,Sam. You keep looking at me like I'm going to explode.
12,2,SAM (CHUCKLES),I'm sorry.
12,2,DEAN,Oh
12,2,MARY,"But what do we think? Are we buying that Brit's whole ""Let's be friends"" routine?"
12,2,SAM,No. No way.
12,2,DEAN,No. Mmm.
12,2,MARY,Could you eat that any faster?
12,2,MARY,"Well, we should call the Internet and find out as much as we can about these people. Did I say that right?"
12,2,DEAN,So close.
12,2,SAM,"Yeah, it was close."
12,2,DEAN,You want any?
12,2,SAM,"No. Uh, not now."
12,2,INTERIOR,"HELL, LUCIFER IS SITTING ON THE THRONE.  WITH A FLICK OF HIS HAND, HE TURNS ROWENA TOWARD HIM."
12,2,LUCIFER,"You know, I got to say, Rowena, I took one look at you, and all I wanted was to snap your miserable neck again. And keep it snapped this time. But I think I've decided against it."
12,2,ROWENA,"You won't regret it, sir. I'm done with all this. I'll stay far, far away, sipping martinis with republicans at my tennis club."
12,2,ROWENA,What?
12,2,LUCIFER,"How's that saying go? Mm, friends close... ...enemies closer."
12,2,ROWENA,No. No!
12,2,INTERIOR,"BUNKER, MARY TURNS WHEN SHE HEARS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR."
12,2,MARY,Yes?
12,2,SAM,"Hey. Hi. Sorry. I hope I didn't wake you up. I-I, uh...wanted to bring you this."
12,2,MARY,Thank you.
12,2,SAM,"You're welcome.  I don't know if you drink tea, but..."
12,2,MARY,I do.
12,2,SAM,"Good. Uh, and I wanted to say... if you ever want to talk, I know what it's like to come back and not feel like you really fit."
12,2,MARY,"I just have so much about you boys to catch up on. Mother stuff. You know, first tooth, first crush."
12,2,SAM,Yeah.
12,2,Mary,I just have a lot of blanks to fill in.
12,2,SAM,"Right, uh..."
12,2,SAM,"Dad's journal. His writing, his words. Helped me fill in some blanks, answer some questions I didn't know I had. And, you know, it – it – it keeps him with us, sort of."
12,2,MARY,Thank you.
12,2,SAM,Good night.
12,2,MARY,Dean said you got out of hunting.
12,2,SAM,Yeah.
12,2,MARY,And yet here you are.
12,2,SAM,"Well, this is my family. My family hunts, you know? It's what we do."
12,2,SAM,"Mom. For me... just, um... having you here... fills in the biggest blank."
12,2,EXTERIOR,"NIGHT, DRIVING IN A CAR."
12,2,TONI,I will not get on that plane.
12,2,MICK,"Yes, you will. Your mission was to identify American Hunters and gain their trust. That's what the home office wants. Honey, not vinegar."
12,2,TONI,"I have a dossier, and I am just getting started."
12,2,MICK,They've also had their fair share of successes.
12,2,TONI,"If our goal is to end the supernatural threat here, we need to destroy every obstacle. The Winchesters, these American Hunters, they're no better than the monsters they fail to control. They need to be eliminated, Mick."
12,2,MICK,"If push comes to shove, your ladyship, I'm prepared for that."
12,2,TONI,You'll get your hands dirty?
12,2,MICK,"Well, we have Mr. Ketch for that."
12,2,TONI,You'll send for him?
12,2,MICK,I already have.
12,2,INTERIOR,A ROOM IN LONDON.  A MAN (MR. KETCH) IS PACKING UP HIS KIT (LOTS OF GUNS). FINAL SHOT IS LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AT THE TOWER BRIDGE.

12,4,OLIVIA,Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw!
12,4,OLIVIA,Prok yaw-thi...
12,4,OLIVIA,Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw!
12,4,SAM,Father Valdecantos?
12,4,SAM,I'm Father Penn of the Dubuque Archdiocese. This is –
12,4,DEAN,Father DeNiro.
12,4,SAM,We're here to talk about Olivia Sanchez.
12,4,FATHER VALDECANTOS,I'm not talking about that anymore.
12,4,DEAN,"You sure were chatty with the press and the cops. ""Priest Claims Demons Walk Among Us."" Boy, that's quite the headline grabber."
12,4,FATHER VALDECANTOS,I said I'm not talking about –
12,4,DEAN,"No, we heard you. Don't care."
12,4,FATHER VALDECANTOS,"You'll think I'm lying, like my bishop, like everyone. But I knew Olivia. She was a good person. I watched her get flayed alive by some invisible force. That was the devil's work. I've been told the church doesn't want us talking like that anymore – too old fashioned. But I know what I saw."
12,4,DEAN,You see any black smoke?
12,4,FATHER VALDECANTOS,What?
12,4,SAM,"We don't think you're lying. We just wanna ask you a few questions, that's all."
12,4,FATHER VALDECANTOS,Um...no. No smoke.
12,4,FATHER VALDECANTOS,No.
12,4,SAM,You told people that she was speaking in tongues?
12,4,FATHER VALDECANTOS,Yes. It sounded like Hebrew. Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw.
12,4,SAM,Sounds more like Aramaic than Hebrew.
12,4,DEAN,Hmm.
12,4,FATHER VALDECANTOS,What kind of priests are you?
12,4,DEAN,The old-fashioned kind.
12,4,SAM,Thanks.
12,4,DEAN,So no sulfur means no demon. You think the padre's right? We talking about Lucifer here?
12,4,SAM,Little small-time for him.  I don't know. Maybe a rogue angel?
12,4,SAM,Dean.
12,4,DEAN,"Yeah. Uh, I'll make a call."
12,4,DEAN,"Wait, wait, wait. What? Are you serious? Yes, Cass, that's weird. It's really, really weird. All right, yeah. Um... Thanks for the heads up."
12,4,DEAN,Now I'm a 13-year-old girl.
12,4,SAM,Hey. So what's the word? Cass have anything?
12,4,SAM,Bad news?
12,4,DEAN,Cass is chumming it up with Crowley.
12,4,SAM,Hmm.
12,4,DEAN,"They're hunting Lucifer together. That's right – one's an angel, one's a demon, and apparently, they solve crimes."
12,4,SAM,Are they having any luck?
12,4,DEAN,"Kind of. So Lucifer, the Lord of Evil, Angel of Light, is now the Master of Butt Rock. He jumped into Vince Vincente."
12,4,SAM,The rock star?
12,4,DEAN,The douchebag. Guy used to roll with purple hair down to his butt and a spiked codpiece.
12,4,SAM,It – it was the '80s.
12,4,DEAN,The what?
12,4,DEAN,"What, are you defending him?"
12,4,SAM (SIGHING),"No, I'm not... I mean, his third album was kind of... not horrible."
12,4,DEAN,I hate you so much right now.
12,4,SAM,"Anyway, he's the Devil now?"
12,4,DEAN,"Well, I mean, he was always kind of the Devil, but, yeah, now it's official."
12,4,SAM,Where is he?
12,4,DEAN,Rowena blasted him to the bottom of the ocean.
12,4,SAM,Why?
12,4,DEAN,I don't know. Why do you love Vince Vincente?
12,4,SAM,"I don't love – Anyways, uh, looked at those words. I was right. They are Aramaic. READS FROM A TABLET. ""Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw."" It means, ""Save me, oh, God."""
12,4,DEAN,Save me from what?
12,4,INTERIOR,A MORGUE.  CARL OPENS THE DOOR TO AN EXAM ROOM AND LEADS SAM AND DEAN INSIDE.
12,4,CARL,"Body's right there, Agents. I can get her prepped to your –"
12,4,DEAN,"That's great, Carl. Uh... We'll take it from here."
12,4,CARL,"Oh? Okay. Um, but...it's a weird'un. If you guys need anything at all, I'm –"
12,4,DEAN,We won't. We won't. Thank you.
12,4,CARL,"Are...you sure? Yep. Oh, okay."
12,4,SAM,"Little, uh, tough on Carl, don't you think?"
12,4,DEAN,"Ah, he's a big boy. He can take it."
12,4,SAM,You okay?
12,4,DEAN,Peachy.
12,4,SAM,"You sure? 'Cause ever since Mom left, you've been a little, uh... cranky."
12,4,DEAN,"Cranky, huh?"
12,4,SAM,"Yeah. I mean, to the priest, to Carl. Heck, on the way here, you wouldn't even make a pit stop."
12,4,DEAN,So now your tiny bladder is my problem?
12,4,SAM,I'm just saying –
12,4,DEAN,"Olivia Sanchez. The body was found. It had deep cuts on her back as though she'd been whipped. Holes punctured through her hands and her feet, and pinprick wounds around the top of her skull. What's that sound like to you?"
12,4,SAM,Stigmata.
12,4,DEAN,Bingo. Gets weirder.
12,4,SAM,How?
12,4,SAM (READING),"""The victim's skull was filled with a goopy mush."""
12,4,DEAN,"That Carl paints quite a picture, doesn't he? All right. What can do all that?"
12,4,DEAN,Me neither.
12,4,SAM,"Well, maybe we should focus more on the case and less on the Dr. Phil crap."
12,4,BETH,It's just over here. This is – was Olivia's office.
12,4,SAM,So...what is it now?
12,4,BETH,...kinda mine now.
12,4,DEAN,So is that yours?
12,4,BETH,It's for positive energy. I'm a Wiccan.
12,4,DEAN,Cool.
12,4,SAM,So how well did you know Olivia?
12,4,BETH,"She was my boss. Is it true what they're saying, that she, you know... killed herself?"
12,4,SAM,"Well, we're working on that. Um, now the day she died, was Olivia acting strange?"
12,4,BETH,"Not really. I mean... She was getting headaches. Bad ones, like super migraines. But we all knew she was working too hard."
12,4,SAM,She have any enemies?
12,4,DEAN,"Somebody who held a grudge, maybe wanted to do her harm?"
12,4,BETH,"Yeah. I mean, Olivia was great, but this is Child Protective Services. We get threats all the time."
12,4,SAM,From who?
12,4,BETH,Everyone. You don't make a lot of friends when sometimes what's best for a family is to split them up.
12,4,SAM,"Right. Um, yeah, can we see Olivia's case files?"
12,4,BETH,Of course. They're right over here.
12,4,EXTERIOR,DAYLIGHT.  THE BROTHERS EXIT THE BUILDING WITH SAM HOLDING THE CASE FILES.
12,4,DEAN,"Well, that was easy."
12,4,SAM,What?
12,4,DEAN,"What? The Wicca'd Witch of the West in there. Little Miss Positive Energy wanted a bigger office, did a little hoodoo... Boom. I say we put a witch-killing cap in her ass, call it a day."
12,4,SAM,"Yeah, but we checked the church and Olivia's house. We didn't exactly find any hex bags."
12,4,DEAN,So she covered her tracks.
12,4,SAM,But we're not looking at a witch. I'm not saying it's not Beth.
12,4,SAM,"I'm – I'm just saying we need proof. And look, if it's her, I'll shoot her myself."
12,4,DEAN,"Oh, no, no, no, no. No, I'm definitely shooting her."
12,4,EXTERIOR,NIGHT.  A DELIVERY BOY PICKS UP PRODUCE AT A LOADING DOCK.  HE’S LISTENING TO MUSIC ON HEAD PHONES.  THERE’S THE SOUND OF A WHIP CRACKING AND BLOOD APPEARS ON HIS BACK.
12,4,RICKY COPELAND,Aah! Oh! Aah! Ah! Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw!
12,4,RICKY,Aah!
12,4,EXTERIOR,DAYLIGHT.  AT THE LOADING DOCK.  DEAN FINISHES QUESTIONING A MAN AND WALKS OVER TO SAM WHO’S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POLICE TAPE.
12,4,DEAN,"Coroner says signs of stigmata with a side of scrambled brains, just like Olivia."
12,4,SAM,Great.
12,4,DEAN,Did you find anything?
12,4,SAM,"Maybe. Kid delivered groceries all over town, so I checked his route against Olivia's case files."
12,4,DEAN,And?
12,4,SAM,Got a match.
12,4,BETH,They're weird.
12,4,BETH,"All the way. That family, they're, like, off the charts religious. Old, old Testament. I'm talking no cars, no electricity, no nothing. Kids are homeschooled. Family like that, we try to keep an eye on them, but..."
12,4,SAM,"But what, Beth?"
12,4,BETH,"Their oldest, Magda – a few years ago, she got pneumonia, and the family wouldn't let a doctor treat her. They said whatever happened was God's will."
12,4,DEAN,What happened?
12,4,BETH,She died.
12,4,SAM,"All right. Um, thank you."
12,4,SAM,So?
12,4,DEAN,"Weird, creepy, off the grid, ""Children of the Corn"" people? Yeah, I'm in."
12,4,DEAN,Guess we're walking from here.
12,4,DEAN,"Whoa. When they cut the cord, they really cut the cord."
12,4,SAM,"Yeah, no kidding."
12,4,DEAN,"How fast you think their buggy goes? Like, top speed?"
12,4,SAM,"Hey, about yesterday..."
12,4,DEAN,"Oh, all right. Next time you gotta take a leak, I'll pull over."
12,4,SAM,I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about you and Mom.
12,4,DEAN,"What about her? What, she took some cash, she took a cellphone she doesn't answer, and she bailed on us."
12,4,SAM,"I mean, think about what she's going through. After everything, she probably just needs some space. We've been there. We've both had times where we needed time apart."
12,4,DEAN,And we both came back.
12,4,SAM,You don't think she's going to?
12,4,DEAN,"I don't know. She hates the way that we were raised. She hates the fact that we're hunters. Maybe she starts walking and she doesn't stop. You know, she obviously has zero interest in keeping this family together."
12,4,SAM,"Well, you know, sometimes families do better after a little time apart."
12,4,DEAN,"Yeah, who? The Mansons?"
12,4,ABRAHAM PETERSON,Can I help you?
12,4,SAM,"Uh, Abraham Peterson? I'm James Morrison. This is my associate Ray Manzarek. Uh, we're your new case workers with Child Protective Services."
12,4,ABRAHAM,Pleasure to meet you.
12,4,SAM,Pleasure to meet you.
12,4,DEAN,"Yeah, thought you'd be, uh, you know, long beard, suspenders, big hat."
12,4,ABRAHAM (CHUCKLES),We're not that kind of religious.
12,4,DEAN,Ah.
12,4,INTERIOR,THE PETERSON’S LIVING ROOM.
12,4,SAM,"Mr. and Mrs. Peterson, we're here because your previous case worker, Olivia Sanchez, has passed away."
12,4,ABRAHAM,What happened?
12,4,DEAN,We're not sure yet.
12,4,SAM,How often did she visit?
12,4,ABRAHAM,Every few months.
12,4,GAIL PETERSON,We liked her better than the other one – that Beth.
12,4,SAM,And what was wrong with Beth?
12,4,GAIL,"She hated us because of our faith. Olivia Sanchez was a Papist, but... at least she believed in God."
12,4,DEAN,Hmm.
12,4,GAIL,"Do you know God, gentlemen?"
12,4,DEAN,"Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we're – we're besties."
12,4,ABRAHAM,"Okay. Um...I'm a little embarrassed to ask, but do you think one of you boys might help me with something?"
12,4,EXTERIOR,DAYLIGHT. A MOTORCYCLE COMES DOWN THE ROAD.  IT STEPS WHEN IT COMES LEVEL WITH THE IMPALA.  THE MAN CHECKS THE LICENSE PLATE AND MOVES ON.
12,4,EXTERIOR,OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.  THE BUGGY HAS LOST A WHEEL.
12,4,DEAN,"So what happens when, uh, stuff like this goes wrong and no one's around to help you?"
12,4,ELIJAH,Pray harder.
12,4,ABRAHAM,"See, I'm not good with all this. I was a computer programmer till about five years ago."
12,4,DEAN,What made you move out to the middle of nowhere?
12,4,ABRAHAM,"Oh, the world out there is all distractions. Consumerism, corporations. And the people, if they're not shopping or stuffing their face, they're sitting in front of some screen watching fake people do fake things, while the real world just gets more and more screwed up. Gail and I, we didn't want that for our kids, so... so here we are, sweatin' our butts off."
12,4,DEAN,The things you do for family. Hmm.
12,4,ELIJAH,It's ready.
12,4,ABRAHAM,"All right, let's get this wheel on. On three. One, two, three."
12,4,ELIJAH,Okay.
12,4,INTERIOR,THE LIVING ROOM.  A CLOCK IS CHIMING.  SAM LOOKS AT A FAMILY PICTURE.
12,4,GAIL,We're out of coffee. Hope lemonade's all right.
12,4,SAM,"Oh, yeah. Great. Thank you."
12,4,GAIL,Welcome.
12,4,SAM,Happy family.
12,4,GAIL,"No, they weren't. The father was working 80 hours a week to barely pay the mortgage. And what little time he did spend at home, he spent in a bottle. Children were on four different kinds of behavior-enhancing medication and barely spoke. Could text up a storm, though. And the mother, she was the worst. She was so pilled up, she could barely think straight."
12,4,SAM,So what happened?
12,4,GAIL,God showed them a better way. I was in a car accident.  Almost died. Nerves in the lower half of my body are damaged.
12,4,SAM,Wow.
12,4,GAIL,"I saw doctors. No one could stop the pain. Best they could do was give me drugs, which helped for a while."
12,4,GAIL,"But the more I took, the more I needed. And when I didn't get them... And then one night, when things were at their worst, I was... lying in a puddle of my own sick. I heard a voice. It was God's voice. And he said, ""Go, live a life of simplicity and humility, and all your pain will be taken away."""
12,4,SAM,So has the pain gone away?
12,4,GAIL,"I get by, with His grace."
12,4,SAM,"Mrs. Peterson, um, what can you tell me about Ricky Copeland?"
12,4,GAIL,The delivery boy?
12,4,SAM,Yeah.
12,4,GAIL,"Comes by once a week, brings us things we can't grow ourselves. Why?"
12,4,SAM,"Well... He's dead, too."
12,4,GAIL,I see.
12,4,SAM,You see? That's it?
12,4,GAIL,God has a plan for us all.
12,4,SAM,"So what happened to your daughter, was that God's plan?"
12,4,GAIL,Yes.
12,4,SAM,She didn't have to die. She was sick. If you had taken her to a doctor –
12,4,GAIL,God does –
12,4,ABRAHAM,Think you boys should go.
12,4,EXTERIOR,DAYLIGHT.  DEAN OPENS THE TRUNK OF THE IMPALA.
12,4,DEAN,"All right. We're clear on what we gotta do, right?"
12,4,SAM,"Yeah, definitely."
12,4,DEAN,What's that for?
12,4,SAM,To track down Magda's ghost. What's...
12,4,DEAN,Beth. The witch.
12,4,SAM,"Dean, this isn't a witch."
12,4,DEAN,"Well, it's not a ghost."
12,4,SAM,Those people let their daughter die. She's angry and wants revenge.
12,4,DEAN,"Yeah, but they're alive. Besides, how – how she getting around town, huh? Ghosts are tied to one place."
12,4,SAM,Or – or to a person or to a thing.
12,4,DEAN,"Oh, you're reaching."
12,4,SAM,And you're not?  Beth didn't even know the delivery boy.
12,4,DEAN,"Maybe, maybe not, but I'm gonna find out."
12,4,SAM,"Look, you didn't spend alone time with that woman. She is disturbed."
12,4,DEAN,"The family's weird, but they're good people. Look, Beth wanted the better job, she killed to get it. End of story."
12,4,SAM,You're wrong.
12,4,DEAN,"All right, look, you got your ideas, I got mine. You wanna stay here and, uh, scan the farm for EMF, you go right ahead. I'm on Beth."
12,4,SAM,Fine. We'll see who's right.
12,4,DEAN,"Well, you'll see I'm right."
12,4,INTERIOR,THE PETERSON HOUSE.  GAIL OPENS THE DOOR TO THE BASEMENT AND WALKS DOWN.
12,4,GAIL,What did you do?
12,4,MAGDA,Nothing. Nothing.
12,4,GAIL,Liar. That woman. That boy. You killed them.
12,4,MAGDA,What? No.
12,4,GAIL,"I have tried to keep the Devil locked away, and you let him out. You couldn't let it rest. And now... Now the Devil is doing his work through you. Confess your sins."
12,4,GAIL,Pray for forgiveness.
12,4,MAGDA,Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw a-rum mayyaw mto 'ad naf-Shaw.
12,4,MAGDA,Tma-'ith bama-'a-ma-ke syawn w-leth a-Thar lma'kum.
12,4,EXTERIOR,DAYLIGHT OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.  ELIJAH MOVES TOWARD THE BASEMENT WINDOW AND LOOKS INSIDE.  WHERE MAGDA HITS HERSELF AGAIN AND CRIES OUT.
12,4,MAGDA,Ishthal-hith bmik-ri.
12,4,EXTERIOR,"THE PETERSON BARN.  FLASHLIGHT OUT, SAM STEPS INSIDE HOLDING AN EMF METER.  HE HEARS A DOOR CREEK AND HIDES.  ABRAHAM AND ELIJAH ENTER."
12,4,ABRAHAM,Elijah? What's wrong?
12,4,ELIJAH,Mom's with Magda.
12,4,ABRAHAM,"Your mother's doing God's work. She's hurting her. Son, the Devil's a deceiver. Don't let him sow doubt in you."
12,4,ABRAHAM,And if that happened... I love your sister... but you know what she can do. Magda... Magda's our cross to bear.
12,4,SAM,Come on.
12,4,INTERIOR,CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES.  BETH IS SITTING AT HER DESK.  THE CANDLE IS STILL LIT.
12,4,DEAN,Working late?
12,4,BETH,"Oh. Sorry, Agent, you surprised me."
12,4,DEAN,No worries.
12,4,BETH,Can I help you?
12,4,DEAN,How you liking the new gig?
12,4,BETH,I hate it.
12,4,DEAN,What?
12,4,BETH,"Yeah. You make more, but you work more. And if somebody screws up, that's on you. If somebody blows a deadline, that's on you. And if somebody's photocopying their ass in the breakroom, you have to adult and act all mad, even though it's kind of hilarious. Being the boss sucks. I don't know how Olivia did it."
12,4,DEAN,I-I thought you wanted this job.
12,4,DEAN,Oh.
12,4,BETH,So...why are you here?
12,4,DEAN,Um...
12,4,INTERIOR,BASEMENT OF THE PETERSON HOUSE.
12,4,GAIL,Krav lwaw-thi prok yaw-thi.
12,4,GAIL,Hekh ksa-gi-uth Ra-chamawch this-tha-kal lwaw-thi.

12,4,GAIL,Again. Again!
12,4,GAIL,Ra-chamawch this-tha-kal lwaw-thi. Shezev-Ni mba'-Le dvawv-vay.
12,4,DEAN,Beth is not a witch. You were right about the whole ghost thing.
12,4,SAM,"Listen, Magda is still alive."
12,4,DEAN,"Wait, what?"
12,4,SAM,"Yes, Magda's not dead. She's alive."
12,4,DEAN,Sam.
12,4,ELIJAH,Don't move.
12,4,SAM,"Okay, listen to me. I can help your sister, okay? I just need you to trust me here."
12,4,EXTERIOR,NIGHT.  DEAN EXITS THE CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES BUILDING.
12,4,DEAN,Sam? Sammy?
12,4,INTERIOR,BASEMENT OF THE PETERSON HOUSE.
12,4,SAM,Magda?
12,4,SAM,Magda Peterson.
12,4,MAGDA,That's not my name. I'm not Magda. I'm the Devil.
12,4,SAM,"No. No, you're not. You're really not."
12,4,MAGDA,He's inside me. I can hear him whispering. He lets me hear what people are thinking. He lets me do things.
12,4,SAM,"What kind of things? Magda, I'm here... I'm here to help you. Show me. Please."
12,4,INTERIOR,DINING ROOM OF THE PETERSON HOUSE. SAM’S CELLPHONE RINGS AS THE PETERSON’S STARE AT IT FROM WHERE THEY’RE STANDING.
12,4,GAIL,"They'll come for us, our children. We need to leave tonight."
12,4,INTERIOR,PETERSON’S BASEMENT.
12,4,SAM,"Magda... You're not the Devil. You're just psychic. There are others out there like you, like – like me. I have powers, too. I'd get these visions sometimes and – and I could move things with my mind."
12,4,MAGDA,You can do that?
12,4,SAM,"Well, no, not anymore, I don't think. But that didn't make me the Devil. It – it – it just made me who I am."
12,4,MAGDA,"Then you are evil.  Mother says I'm evil, 'cause I hurt people."
12,4,SAM,Who did you hurt?
12,4,MAGDA,"I didn't mean it. She was pretty, and she always smiled. And I thought that maybe she could help me. I couldn't talk to her, but I could hear her thoughts. And I thought maybe I could make her hear mine. (Speaking Aramaic) So I prayed. Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw."
12,4,MAGDA,Tma-'ith bama-'a-ma-ke syawn w-leth a-Thar lma'kum. And I reached out to her... Ishthal-hith bmik-ri ith-char-char 'inki. ...but she never came.
12,4,MAGDA,And I did it again with the delivery boy. Mother says I killed them.
12,4,SAM,"Magda, that wasn't your fault. You are not the Devil. You're not evil. And it's scary. I-I know it's scary. But you can learn how to control it. You don't ever have to hurt anyone ever again."
12,4,ELIJAH,It's time for supper.
12,4,INTERIOR,THE PETERSON’S DINNING ROOM.  THE CLOCK CHIMES AS SAM’S HANDS ARE TIED TO THE BACK OF A CHAIR.  GAIL GRABS A POT OF STEW FROM THE SIDEBOARD.
12,4,GAIL,Who's hungry?
12,4,SAM,Abraham... your daughter needs help.
12,4,ABRAHAM,What do you think we've been doing all these years?
12,4,GAIL,"You talk about knowing God, but we know the Devil."
12,4,GAIL,We've been wrestling with her for years. You have any idea what she's done?
12,4,SAM,"Those people, but... That wasn't her fault."
12,4,GAIL,You think they're the first? Tell him. Tell him.
12,4,MAGDA,"Before we came here... I wanted a new cellphone, but my mom wouldn't buy me one."
12,4,GAIL,"We were driving home, and she screamed at me to pull over. And I felt the Devil at my hands. I yanked that wheel right into oncoming traffic. She did this to me. She did this to us. She has taken lives. Don't you understand that by keeping her here, we're protecting you?"
12,4,SAM,By doing what? Beating the hell out of her?
12,4,GAIL,Pain purges sin.
12,4,SAM,"No, it doesn't. You're wrong. Abraham."
12,4,GAIL,It's time.
12,4,ABRAHAM,"We thank you for these bountiful gifts. May they nourish our body and soul.  And look after each one of us, now and until our dying day. Amen."
12,4,ABRAHAM,Mm.
12,4,GAIL,"Dig in, everyone. Elijah."
12,4,ELIJAH,Dad?
12,4,SAM,Abraham?
12,4,ELIJAH,Dad?
12,4,GAIL,Shh.
12,4,SAM,What did you do?
12,4,GAIL,Eat.
12,4,SAM,What did you do?!
12,4,GAIL,This is how we will stay together. We will enter Heaven as a family. Eat!
12,4,SAM,"Elijah, do not eat that. Elijah!"
12,4,ELIJAH,Mom?
12,4,GAIL,Eat.
12,4,SAM,"Elijah, do not do it."
12,4,GAIL,Eat!
12,4,MAGDA (SCREAMS),No!
12,4,GAIL,Devil.
12,4,ELIJAH,No!
12,4,MAGDA,I'm not the Devil. You are.
12,4,SAM,"Magda, stop! You don't have to do this. You could control it. Magda, nobody else has to die. Please!"
12,4,EXTERIOR,DAY. OUTSIDE THE PETERSON HOUSE.  LAW ENFORCEMENT AND AN AMBULANCE ARE PRESENT.  AN EMT CHECKS MAGDA AS GAIL IS WALKED TO A POLICE CAR.
12,4,GAIL,She's the Devil! The Devil is among us! She must be cleansed!  She is the Devil! Pray for us!
12,4,DEAN,Sorry I missed all the psycho.
12,4,SAM,"Hey, you thought our family was crazy."
12,4,DEAN,Yeah.
12,4,SAM,"Hey, Magda. Are you holding up?"
12,4,MAGDA,Beth called my aunt in California. I'm gonna be staying with her.
12,4,BETH,She has a ranch. Lots of wide open country.
12,4,DEAN,"Well, that's great. You know, sometimes in order to figure things out, a person needs space."
12,4,BETH,"Agent, can I talk to you?"
12,4,DEAN,"Yeah, sure."
12,4,SAM,"Magda, I-I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but...you're gonna be all right. You can do this. You will do this. Just remember, that power... it doesn't control you. You control it."
12,4,MAGDA,I know.
12,4,SAM,"If you ever need anything, anything, call me, okay? I'll be there."
12,4,DEAN,"Think you made the right call back there, letting her go?"
12,4,SAM,"I hope so. I mean, Magda didn't know what she was doing. She had no idea. I think she deserves a second chance. What did Beth want?"
12,4,DEAN,"She gave me her number, her personal number."
12,4,SAM,You were gonna shoot her.
12,4,DEAN,"Yeah, I know. Kinda weird. Kinda hot. Pfft."
12,4,SAM,"Hey, um... did you mean what you said back there?"
12,4,DEAN,"Yeah, you were right. This whole mom thing, it's... I mean, we get her back, and then she leaves. I hate it, but I get it. I do. I guess I just...still working through some of that crap. I'll try to be less of a dick about it."
12,4,SAM,Deal.
12,4,SAM,What?
12,4,DEAN,Nothing.
12,4,EXTERIOR,"NIGHT.  THE BUS TO SANTA CRUZ, CALIFORNIA MAKES A STOP TO ALLOW THE PASSENGERS TO TAKE A BREAK."
12,4,BUS DRIVER,"All right, bathrooms to the right. Soda machines to the left. You have 20 minutes, folks. Then we're off to Cali."
12,4,Man,What's your status?
12,4,MR. KETCH,"I cleaned up the Winchesters' mess. As suspected, they couldn't finish the job."
12,4,MAN,"Very well. Thank you, Mr. Ketch."
12,8,ROWENA,"Finding someone. I'd thought I'd met my match. His name was Ben, but it didn't work out. We weren't sexually... It was like riding a heavily-sedated walrus. So, once again, I find myself in search of lasting love."
12,9,SAM,My family hunts. It’s what we do.
12,9,TONI,"If you answer my questions, you'll walk right out that door."
12,9,SAM,I've been tortured by the Devil himself. What can you do to me?
12,9,TONI,They’re no better than the monsters they fail to control. They need to be eliminated.
12,9,DEAN,Aren’t we supposed to be on the same team?
12,9,MARY,[cocks gun and aims it at Toni] Get away from my boys.
12,9,SAM,Mom?
12,9,DEAN,Yeah.
12,9,MICK,"No argument, Lady Bevell went too far. I deeply apologize. We want to work with you. My number. [he hands Cas his card]"
12,9,MARY,I found a case.
12,9,DEAN,"If mom wants to hunt, I say we hunt."
12,9,MARY,I've heard of people coming back from the dead before. But to actually do it? I just have a lot of blanks to fill in.
12,9,MARY,I have to go.
12,9,BILLIE,It’s always nice to see a Winchester who can’t get what he wants.
12,9,DEAN,Billie. She’s a reaper.
12,9,BILLIE,See I’m a big believer in what dies…
12,9,BILLIE,stays dead.
12,9,BILLIE,"If any of you change your minds, you know my name."
12,9,CROWLEY,We’ve got to put Lucifer back in the cage.
12,9,CROWLEY,I think I know the identity of Lucifer’s newest vessel.
12,9,CROWLEY,"Jefferson Rooney, President of these United States."
12,9,KELLY,I just know you’d make an amazing father.
12,9,CASTIEL,A nephilim has come into being. It’s the offspring of an angel and a human.
12,9,SAM,Lucifer.
12,9,CROWLEY,So you’re gonna pop Lucifer out of the President with that?
12,9,DEAN,"I hope so. Otherwise, we’re all dead."
12,9,DEAN,"It’s not like we’re in the “live ‘til you’re 90, die in your sleep” business. This only ends one way."
12,9,MARY,Castiel?
12,9,CASTIEL,"Mary, where are you?"
12,9,MARY,"I-- I, uh… Lawrence, Kansas. Cas, what’s wrong?"
12,9,CASTIEL,"Uh, uuh… well, I-I need you to meet me at the bunker."
12,9,RICK SANCHEZ,"Six hours ago, Sam and Dean Winchester attempted to kill the President of the United States."
12,9,CAMP,[seated at the desk studying the photos] Huh. Do we know why?
12,9,RICK,They haven’t said a word since we picked them up.
12,9,CAMP,Quiet types. Okay. What do we know about ‘em?
12,9,RICK,"A lot. Brothers. Born in Lawrence, Kansas to Mary Winchester, deceased, and John Winchester, also deceased. FBI started investigating them back in 2007."
12,9,CAMP,For what?
12,9,RICK,"Assault, murder, multiple counts of desecrating a corpse."
12,9,CAMP,The same corpse?
12,9,RICK,No. Different corpses.
12,9,RICK,"They made the FBI’s most wanted in 2011, then died in a shootout with police in Ankeny, Iowa. At least, that’s what their file said; but apparently not."
12,9,CAMP,Apparently. What about the girl?
12,9,RICK,"Kelly Kline. And she’s a presidential aide, but no one’s seen her since that day. We don’t know where she went or if she’s still alive."
12,9,CAMP,How many people know about this?
12,9,RICK,"We’re keeping it quiet. Just you, me, the agents who made the arrest, and POTUS. But the last thing he remembers was saying his nightly prayers three days before it happened."
12,9,CAMP,Drugged?
12,9,RICK,"Lab’s running a tox screen now, but probably."
12,9,CAMP,"And by “probably,” you mean “maybe.” And by “maybe,” you mean “I don’t know.” So next time, just say you don’t know."
12,9,RICK,"Look you’re here because you’re some bigshot anti-terrorism... guy. But you want my opinion? We should take those two psychos out back. I cap one, you take the other, we grab an early lunch."
12,9,CAMP,Yeah?
12,9,RICK,They got it comin’.
12,9,CAMP,"Yeah, but what if they’re not working alone? I mean, what if these boys got ties to… Oh, I don’t know. White nationalists? Muslim brotherhood?"
12,9,RICK,Really?
12,9,CAMP,I’m just sayin’. They might be the tip of some nasty-ass iceberg.
12,9,RICK,That-- that’s what you think?
12,9,CAMP,Probably. Maybe. I don’t know. Let’s find out.
12,9,CAMP,"Hi, Dean. How you doing? Can I get you coffee? Water? Or you hungry? [he digs through his pockets] I got a chocolate bar here somewhere. Don’t tell my wife. So… you’ve had a day. Wanna tell me about it? [Camp leans back against the wall and crosses his arms]"
12,9,CAMP,"You just are. Now that’s not a threat. I don’t believe in torture. Doesn’t work. Oh, I’ve seen folks waterboarded, cut on. And they talk. Ooh, they do."
12,9,CAMP,"But they never tell you what you need. You know what does work, though? Every time? Nothing."
12,9,CAMP,"See, when I leave, that door closes, and it stays closed, [scene shifts back to Dean] and you stay in the dark. Now, maybe that doesn’t sound so bad."
12,9,CAMP,"But after a month? [scene shifts to Camp leaning identically in front of Dean] A year? You spend enough time staring at these walls, just you and all that nothing, [shift back to Sam] you’ll get so crazy to talk, to see someone real, you’ll tell me exactly what I need. You’ll tell me with a smile."
12,9,CAMP,It’ll just take some time.
12,9,MICK,"This is Mick Davies, filing Status Update Bravo Three. As instructed, I’ve been attempting to make inroads with the American hunters. But unfortunately, there’s been a few setbacks."
12,9,MICK,"Let me paint you a picture. Of a world without monsters, or demons, or any of those little buggers that go bump in the night. Of a world where no one has to die because of the supernatural. Of a new world, a better world."
12,9,MICK,"Now, if you work with us, you’ll have support, in every sense of the word. You need lore? Our libraries are the biggest and the best. You want money? We have money. You need weapons? We have gear you can’t even imagine. Now what I’m saying, Wally, is that you need people like us, and we need hunters like you."
12,9,MICK,"All we ask in return is that when we call, you go where you’re told and you do what you’re told. For the greater good."
12,9,WALLY,"Let me see your hands. [Mick makes a surprised face] Come on, let me see your hands."
12,9,MICK,"Yeah, all right."
12,9,WALLY,Soft.
12,9,MICK,[seeming pleased by this] Hmm. Thank you.
12,9,WALLY,You ever hunt anything?
12,9,MICK,I’m more tactical. Long-term strategy.
12,9,WALLY,"Right. Listen, uh, Mike--"
12,9,MICK,Mick.
12,9,WALLY,"Whatever. I don’t know you, and I ain’t lookin’ to take any orders from anyone. Especially some [puts on English accent] limey paper pusher."
12,9,MICK,"I’m not quite sure you understand, mate."
12,9,WALLY,"No, I think I do. So no offense, but you can take your offer [clears his throat] and you can [clicks tongue] shove it up your ass. I’m sure it won’t be too painful, what with those soft hands of yours, right?"
12,9,WALLY,"That’s, uh, that’s for the burger."
12,9,MICK,"In short, the American hunters have proven… difficult. As for the Winchesters…"
12,9,MARY,You left them.
12,9,CASTIEL,"No, I… Dean told me to go. The woman--"
12,9,MARY,The one you lost?
12,9,CASTIEL,I didn’t. I… I thought that she--
12,9,MARY,Stop making excuses.
12,9,MARY,"Why… if they needed help, why didn’t they call me?"
12,9,CASTIEL,You were out.
12,9,MARY,"[sighs] How did we let this happen, Castiel?"
12,9,PRISON GUARD,Chow time.
12,9,PRISON GUARD,Chow time.
12,9,CROWLEY,Can’t help you.
12,9,CASTIEL,"Come on, Crowley. The police took them. You have people in the government. You have spies."
12,9,CROWLEY,"I do. But whatever’s happened to Moose and Squirrel, apparently, it’s above their pay grade."
12,9,CASTIEL,Do you even care that they’re gone?
12,9,CROWLEY,No. Do you know how many all-powerful beings have tried to kill them?
12,9,CASTIEL,"Roughly, yes."
12,9,CROWLEY,"As do I. I was bloody one of them. Sam and Dean? They’re like herpes. Just when you think they’re gone… Hello! The boys are back, leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. So wherever they are, whoever has Sam and Dean, well… In the immortal words of Lawrence Tureaud..  [imitates Mr. T] “I pity the fool.”"
12,9,MARY,Oh. No… he’s…
12,9,GIRL,Mary?
12,9,MARY,Yeah.
12,9,GIRL,"This is Alicia. Uh, Asa’s kid?"
12,9,MARY,Oh.
12,9,ALICIA,"Look, I-- me and my brother, we’re working this case in Louisiana."
12,9,ALICIA,"We thought it was some southern fried werewolf thing, but it’s not one thing. It’s a pack. There’s, like, a billion of them down here, and… we need help."
12,9,MARY,Where are you?
12,9,MARY,"Thanks for meeting me. I just wanted to say [clears throat] I’m sorry. I was angry, and… Sam and Dean, that’s not your fault."
12,9,CASTIEL,"No, you were right. I should never have left them. I… Have you heard anything?"
12,9,MARY,"All my law enforcement contacts are retired, or…  dead. [sighs] I’m trying, but… You?"
12,9,CASTIEL,[shakes his head]
12,9,MARY,I keep telling myself they’re fine. They’ve only been gone--
12,9,CASTIEL,"Six weeks, two days, and ten hours."
12,9,MARY,"We’ll find them, Castiel. We will. Until then, we just… We’re doin’ our best."
12,9,CASTIEL,"Are we? Did you hear about the murders in Lancaster, Missouri?"
12,9,MARY,No.
12,9,CASTIEL,"The women with their throats ripped out, the blood drained?"
12,9,MARY,Vampire.
12,9,CASTIEL,"I saw it on the news and I thought, that’s the sort of thing Sam and Dean would investigate. They would roll into town, save the day, kill the monsters. But with them gone… I tried to work the case. I tried. [bitter little laugh] But… I don’t know what I did wrong. I… I asked questions, but maybe they were the wrong people, or the wrong questions, and I just-- I never found it. Never found the monster. Never even got close. And three more women died before I left town. Before I ran away."
12,9,MARY,So we go back. You and me.
12,9,CASTIEL,"No. No, I’d only get in your way."
12,9,PRISON GUARD,Chow time!
12,9,GUARD,"Yo, eat up."
12,9,GUARD,Crap.
12,9,CAMP,What happened?
12,9,GUARD,"I was doing my rounds, and I did CPR, but he was gone."
12,9,RICK,Get that other cell open. Now!
12,9,CAMP,He’s dead.
12,9,DOCTOR WINTERS,I don’t get it. They both died on the same day? That’s not… How’s that even possible?
12,9,CAMP,You tell us.
12,9,RICK,"Great plan. For the last two months, we’ve done nothing but sit around with our junk in our hands because you wanted to wait them out. That really worked. Yeah, nice job."
12,9,WINTERS,"Well, I’m just gonna… Yeah."
12,9,CAMP,You wanted them dead. They’re dead.
12,9,RICK,I wanted them punished. I wanted to look Dean Winchester in the eye and… wanted him to feel it.
12,9,CAMP,Well that… that is totally mentally normal.
12,9,RICK,Go to hell.
12,9,MARY,"Castiel, it’s me. I’m just calling to… You don’t have to worry about that thing in Missouri. I’m handling it."
12,9,SAM,You good?
12,9,DEAN,"Yeah, I’ve been better. I’ve been worse."
12,9,SAM,Looks like it worked.
12,9,DEAN,So far.
12,9,WINTERS,H-how?
12,9,SAM,Where are we?
12,9,WINTERS,I-I don’t know.
12,9,DEAN,Answer him. [Dean goes through the doctor’s pockets and steals his phone]
12,9,WINTERS,"Seriously, they blindfold me every day before they bring me to work. I… This place. It’s not supposed to exist."
12,9,Sam,[inspects the area outside] Clear.
12,9,CASTIEL,This is my voice mail. Make your voice… a mail…
12,9,SAM,"[indicating a van parked outside marked Farkas Supply Company] Hey, should we take it?"
12,9,DEAN,"No, it’s probably got lojack. [he tries to call Cas again, and gets his voice mail, while Sam rummages through the truck]"
12,9,DEAN,"Come on, Cas."
12,9,SAM,Got a map.
12,9,CASTIEL,What?
12,9,DEAN,Cas.
12,9,CASTIEL,[shocked] Dean?
12,9,DEAN,"Hey, buddy. Long time."
12,9,CASTIEL,What… What happened? Wh-- where are you?
12,9,DEAN,"You wouldn’t believe me, and I have no clue. Uh…"
12,9,SAM,"Got something. [looking from his map to the surrounding mountains] All right, looks like that’s Elk Mountain, which makes that Long’s Peak."
12,9,DEAN,"[to Cas, on the phone] Okay, looks like we’re in Colorado."
12,9,SAM,"In Rocky Mountain National Park. Uh, if we head north we should hit State Route 34. Eventually."
12,9,DEAN,[to Cas] Did you get that?
12,9,CASTIEL,Yes.
12,9,DEAN,"All right, meet us there."
12,9,CASTIEL,"Wait, where?"
12,9,DEAN,"Just drive along the road and you’ll see us. And, Cas… We’re kinda on the clock here."
12,9,CASTIEL,"Wait, what does that…  [sighs]"
12,9,SAM,You didn’t tell him?
12,9,DEAN,No.
12,9,SAM,They’ll track the phone.
12,9,DEAN,Right. [he throws the doctor’s phone into the van and they both run off to the north through the woods]
12,9,MARY,Castiel? Slow… slow down. What?
12,9,CAMP,The hell?
12,9,WINTERS,Hey.
12,9,CAMP,This isn’t… I took his pulse. They were dead.
12,9,RICK,"Look, I got no idea what went down here. Maybe they got to one of the guards. Maybe this is some slow your heartbeat kung fu crap. What I do know-- the Winchesters are out there. And this time, we’re doing it my way."
12,9,RICK,"All right! [we see Sam and Dean running through the woods, alternating with the soldiers receiving their orders] We got two runners with about a 45 minute head start. These are killers. So you get eyes, you pull the trigger. Let’s move out."
12,9,CASTIEL,You got here quickly.
12,9,MARY,Yep. What do you think we’re walking into?
12,9,CASTIEL,I don’t know.
12,9,MARY,We may want backup.
12,9,CASTIEL,Crowley and Rowena?
12,9,MARY,The King of Hell and his mother? The witch? [scoffs] Hope we can do better than that.
12,9,CASTIEL,I may have an idea.
12,9,MARY,Good. Seat belt on. I drive fast.
12,9,RICK,"Long time since you’ve been in the field, huh? I mean, if you need to head back..."
12,9,CAMP,I’m fine.
12,9,SAM,"All right, so we got what? An hour ‘til dark? Which puts us at six hours ‘til midnight?"
12,9,DEAN,That sounds about right.
12,9,SAM,"Dean, we gotta talk about this."
12,9,DEAN,"Okay, we will. All right? Later."
12,9,MARY,This is your idea? The people that almost killed my boys? They’re gonna be our backup? Suddenly the demon and his mommy don’t look so bad.
12,9,CASTIEL,They helped us with Lucifer.
12,9,MICK,Lucifer? The Lucifer?
12,9,CASTIEL,Yes.
12,9,MICK,"Wait, so you’re telling me what happened in Indianapolis was you took on the bleedin’ devil himself?"
12,9,CASTIEL,Yes.
12,9,KETCH,Did you win?
12,9,CASTIEL,Yes.
12,9,KETCH,Bravo.
12,9,MARY,"But… Sam and Dean were taken. We think we can get them back, but we need… help."
12,9,MICK,So we’ll help.
12,9,MARY,Really? Just like that?
12,9,MICK,"Mrs. Winchester-- Mary… I came to this country to do one thing-- Make friends. But you American hunters, you’re… you’re a different breed than our sort. You’re surly. Suspicious. You don’t play well with others."
12,9,CASTIEL,"Well, that is accurate."
12,9,MICK,"You don’t trust people you don’t know, even when they come bearing gifts. Now I can’t help that, but I can help you. And if word were to get out that we did our part to save Sam and Dean Winchester, well, that’s just good business, innit? And who knows? When all this is over, we might even be friends."
12,9,MARY,We think Sam and Dean were being held somewhere in the Rocky Mountain National Forest.
12,9,KETCH,"Site 94? It’s a government facility, off books. Shadow ops. One of those places that officially doesn’t exist."
12,9,MARY,Then how do you know about it?
12,9,MICK,We gather information. It’s our job.
12,9,CASTIEL,They told us to meet them off State Route 34.
12,9,KETCH,"Well, that’s a long stretch of road. Where, exactly?"
12,9,CASTIEL,I’m not sure.
12,9,MICK,I’ll get our techs to put a satellite over the area.
12,9,MARY,You can do that?
12,9,MICK,And so much more.
12,9,KETCH,Do you have any idea what sort of trouble we’re walking into?
12,9,CASTIEL,No.
12,9,KETCH,"Oh, good. I do like a surprise."
12,9,SAM,They’re on us.
12,9,DEAN,"Yeah, Damn it."
12,9,NORTON,"This is Norton. I’m on the ri-- [he’s tackled by Sam, and Dean wrestles away his gun and radio]"
12,9,DEAN,Norton has gone nite-nite.
12,9,RICK,Winchester.
12,9,DEAN,This is the man in charge?
12,9,RICK,That’s right.
12,9,DEAN,"Well, let me tell you how this is gonna go. You’re gonna call your boys, and you’re gonna turn around, and nobody’s gonna get hurt."
12,9,RICK,"No, no. This is how it’s gonna go. I take my highly trained soldiers, track your ass down, and you get hurt. A lot. You can’t run forever. You’re trapped out here."
12,9,DEAN,"Well, what we have here is a failure to communicate. ‘Cause we’re not trapped out here with you. You’re trapped out here with us."
12,9,DEAN,That’ll work.
12,9,RICK,Go!
12,9,SAM,You’ll live.
12,9,DEAN,Hey.
12,9,DEAN,I told you. You’re trapped.
12,9,RICK,Camp. Shoot him!
12,9,SAM,Don’t. Hand me the gun.
12,9,SAM,You want the truth? The President was possessed by the Devil. We saved his life. That’s the truth.
12,9,DEAN,"Now you can take that and do what you want with it. But if you come after us, you know what’ll happen."
12,9,CAMP,Who are you?
12,9,SAM,We’re the guys that save the world.
12,9,CASTIEL,"Sam, Dean."
12,9,DEAN,Cas.
12,9,SAM,Cas.
12,9,SAM,Mom.
12,9,DEAN,"Hey, buddy."
12,9,MARY,Oh.
12,9,SAM,"Mom, how did y’all even find us?"
12,9,MARY,They helped.
12,9,MICK,"Hello, lads."
12,9,CAS,They have a thermal imaging satellite that saw you. From space.
12,9,MICK,"Well, we don’t have one. Just borrowed it for a bit. Friends in all the right places."
12,9,DEAN,"Well, I guess this is where we’re supposed to say thank you."
12,9,MICK,No need. Happy to be of service.
12,9,KETCH,Again.
12,9,KETCH,"Uh, you left survivors?"
12,9,DEAN,"They were soldiers, just doing what they were told."
12,9,KETCH,Still… a bit unprofessional.
12,9,SAM,We’ll handle it. Let’s get.
12,9,DEAN,"So wait, you’re hunting?"
12,9,MARY,A little bit.
12,9,SAM,"Yeah, I knew you couldn’t stay away."
12,9,SAM,It’s time.
12,9,MARY,What’s happening?
12,9,BILLIE,"Yeah, Dean. ‘Sup."
12,9,MARY,Billie?
12,9,CAS,The reaper?
12,9,MARY,I don’t understand.
12,9,DEAN,"Mom… that place… there was only one way we were getting out of there, and that wasn’t breathing. [Cas understands everything now, and turns his horrified look from Dean to Billie.]"
12,9,DEAN,So I made a call.
12,9,DEAN,Billie.
12,9,SAM,"Dean talked with her, and then Billie came to see me."
12,9,SAM,"And we made a deal. We’d get to die and come back one more time, but in exchange…"
12,9,BILLIE,"Come midnight, a Winchester goes bye-bye. Like, permanently. And that is something I’ve been looking forward to for a long time."
12,9,MARY,Why would you--
12,9,DEAN,We were already dead. Being locked in that cell with nothing… I’ve been to Hell. This was worse.
12,9,SAM,"At least this way, one of us gets to keep fighting."
12,9,CAS,You don’t have to do this.
12,9,BILLIE,"Yeah, they do."
12,9,BILLIE,"We made a pact, bound in blood. You break that, there’s consequences on a cosmic scale. So, who’s it gonna be?"
12,9,MARY,Me.
12,9,DEAN,"Mom, mom."
12,9,SAM,No. No.
12,9,MARY,"You said come midnight, a Winchester dies? I’m a Winchester."
12,9,BILLIE,Works for me.
12,9,SAM,Mom!
12,9,DEAN,Don’t!
12,9,MARY,[sniffles] I love you.
12,9,DEAN,"Cas, what have you done?"
12,9,CASTIEL,"What had to be done. You know this world-- this sad, doomed little world-- it needs you. It needs every last Winchester it can get, and I will not let you die. I won’t let any of you die. And I won’t let you sacrifice yourselves. You mean too much to me. To everything. Yeah, you made a deal. You made a stupid deal, and I broke it. You’re welcome."
12,9,MICK,"And just like that, the Winchesters are back, for better or worse. True, they did leave loose ends, but… that’s what Mr. Ketch is for."
12,9,MICK,Every person who knew about Sam and Dean’s little adventure in assassination has been dealt with.
12,9,MICK,"As far as the world’s concerned, it never even happened. The last thing we need is for the United States government sniffing about, asking questions. And as for making inroads with the American hunters, well, good news."
12,9,MICK,"Let me paint you a picture, of a world without monsters, or demons, or any of those little buggers that go bump in the night. Of a world where no one has to die because of the supernatural. Of a new world, a better world."
12,9,MARY,I’m listening.

12,13,ROWENA,He never told me that.
12,14,MICK,Let's go.
12,17,Timothy,What do you think she wants?
12,17,Timothy,"Going home for Christmas? [He glances at Mick, before adding] Sorry. Forgot."
12,17,Mick,"I’ll be here, as always."
12,17,Dr Hess,Gentlemen.
12,17,Timothy/Mick,Headmistress.
12,17,Dr Hess,Come with me.
12,17,Dr Hess,"Timothy, Michael, you have both conquered many trials here at Kendricks, either through natural talent or good old-fashioned hard work. But today, today we'll learn which of you matriculates to the next level of training. This organisation does important work, gentlemen – work which allows millions of people to sleep safely in their beds at night. But in order to do this work, to protect those people, we need cadets who will employ their skills and execute orders without question. And, so [Dr Hess goes to the table and opens a piece of cloth to reveal a knife] only one of you will be leaving this room. Good luck."
12,17,Mick,He fought well. He didn't want to die.
12,17,Dr Hess,"Yet the Code demands otherwise. Well played, Mr Davies."
12,17,Present day,Mick Davies wakes suddenly from a dream. He is in the British Men of Letters US bunker.
12,17,Sam,"So, uh, after we talked, you went back to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho?"
12,17,Sam,Hmm. And?
12,17,Eileen,"And turns out, right after she left, somebody burned down an old warehouse. I did some digging. [Eileen picks up her phone and starts typing a message]. Check your phone."
12,17,Sam,"Okay. [He takes a look]. What are those? Security shots? Oh, yeah. There's Kelly goin' in. Huh."
12,17,Dean,"Wow. [Sam moves the screen so Dean can see Eileen]. Nice work, Eileen."
12,17,Eileen,Thank you.
12,17,Dean,"So this chick with her, that, uh, Pat Benatar wannabe?"
12,17,Sam,"It must be Dagon, I guess. Yeah."
12,17,Dean,"Awesome. Okay, so [he stretches across to chat to see Eileen on the monitor] So... Kelly and Dagon go crash this place, and then it gets torched. Coincidence?"
12,17,Sam,No.
12,17,Eileen,"Hell, no."
12,17,Dean,"All right, well, what are we lookin' at here?"
12,17,Eileen,Working on it.
12,17,Dean,"Well, go get 'em, Eileen."
12,17,Eileen,That's the plan.
12,17,Eileen,"Bye, Sam."
12,17,Sam [smiling],Bye.
12,17,Dean [smirking],That's cute.
12,17,Sam,Come on.
12,17,Sam,"Just saying, Dean, even with Cas and every Hunter we know working this, we still got basically nothing. At least, you know, maybe Crowley..."
12,17,Dean,"No, dude, we're not calling Crowley..."
12,17,Mick,"Hello, boys. Do come and have a drink."
12,17,Sam,Did you break into our house?
12,17,Mick,Our house. Men of Letters. Did you know your key opens every chapter house in the world?
12,17,Mick,"Well, you did say you'd give me a second chance."
12,17,Dean,"Yeah, that doesn't mean we wanna hang out."
12,17,Sam,You here for a reason?
12,17,Mick,"I am, and it's a bit urgent. Some time ago, the home office recorded some sort of cosmic shock wave. Very rare. And after a few months of..."
12,17,Sam,Nephilim.
12,17,Mick,You knew?
12,17,Dean,"Yeah, we knew."
12,17,Mick,How?
12,17,Sam,Sort of a long story.
12,17,Mick,"Well, I've got time."
12,17,Dean,"Well, Lucifer jacked the President...and then knocked up his girlfriend."
12,17,Sam,"And now, she is on the run with Dagon, who is a Prince of Hell."
12,17,Mick,I see. And you didn't tell me this because...
12,17,Dean,Cause it's kind of a need-to-know kind of thing.
12,17,Mick [agitated],The Devil is having a... child. It seems like something we'd need to know. Where is this woman now?
12,17,Sam,"Not sure. We had her. Tried to help her, but, she, uh..."
12,17,Dean,We lost her.
12,17,Sam,Yeah.
12,17,Mick,I'm sorry. You... you had her? And you let her live?
12,17,Dean,"Look, it's not Kelly's fault, okay? She didn't know Lucifer was her boyfriend."
12,17,Mick,"Oh, sure, yeah. It could happen to anyone."
12,17,Sam,"Plus, she'd agreed to end the pregnancy. And I guess she changed her mind. Even with everything Kelly knew, it... it was still her kid. She couldn't."
12,17,Mick,Then you should have! You should've shot her between the eyes immediately.
12,17,Dean,"Oh, why? 'Cause that's what you would've done?"
12,17,Sam,"Kind of like you killed that werewolf? 'Cause from what I remember, that really messed you up."
12,17,Dean,"Yeah, 'cause you're so big on second chances and all."
12,17,Mick,"Yeah... yes. I'm not saying it was gonna be easy, but the Code demands it."
12,17,Dean,Oh. The Code.
12,17,Mick,This is not some werewolf. Do... Do you have any idea what will happen if this abomination is born?
12,17,Sam,"Mick... we're handling it, all right? We'll find her."
12,17,Dean,So until then... I say we drink.
12,17,Lucifer,Dagon. Dagon... Hear me.
12,17,Lucifer,News of my son... All is well?
12,17,Dagon,As can be expected.
12,17,Lucifer,"And the, uh... container?"
12,17,Dagon,She should last as long as needed.
12,17,Lucifer,"Well, she better. Don't fail me, Dagon. Not again."
12,17,Timothy,"Mick, no one's out there. If we run, we might not get caught. We can go to my father. He'll..."
12,17,Mick,"Close the door, Timothy."
12,17,Timothy [pleading],"Mick, we have to go."
12,17,[Dr Hess,"""Only one of you will be leaving this room.""]"
12,17,Timothy,Mick.
12,17,[Dr Hess,"""Good luck.""]"
12,17,Dr Hess,"You didn't report in last night, Mr Davies. Is there a reason?"
12,17,Mick,"No, ma'am. No, I was, uh, I was still in investigation mode. I was gonna inform you."
12,17,Dr Hess,And the Winchesters?
12,17,Mick,Making some progress.
12,17,Dr Hess,"Come in, Mr. Rawlings. [She resumes her call] You are aware that Lady Bevell feels that they are hopeless."
12,17,Mick,"I'm the one cleaning up her mess. Dr. Hess, last I heard, you and the rest of the leadership felt getting the Winchesters was key to bringing the American Hunters on board. I'm just trying to make that happen."
12,17,Dr Hess,"Yes, well, things change."
12,17,Mick,And that means?
12,17,Dr Hess,"This... Nephilim. Something big and bad is on its way, Mr. Davies. We need the situation in America settled now."
12,17,Mick,What? I don't understand.
12,17,Dr Hess,"Then let me make it blisteringly simple. We don't have time to court a handful of mangy Colonials. Not anymore. So either Sam and Dean and the rest of their ill-bred lot learn to obey, or you turn them over to Mr. Ketch... and start fresh."
12,17,Mick,"Look, I don't think..."
12,17,Dr Hess,"This is not a discussion. It's an order. Are you hearing me, Michael? Assimilate or eliminate."
12,17,Dagon,Do you need a pillow or...whatever?
12,17,Dagon,What's wrong?
12,17,Kelly,I keep getting these weird little pains.
12,17,Dagon,I'm sure everything's fine.
12,17,Kelly,Why? Because this is how you felt all the times you were pregnant? I need to see a doctor.
12,17,Dagon,No doctor will understand this child. You barely do. We've been here too long. We should go.
12,17,Kelly,No! You said that you would help me. I wanna see a doctor. I'm not going anywhere until I know my baby's safe.
12,17,Sam,Wow. You look like crap.
12,17,Dean,"Yeah, you look crappier. I gotta hand it to Mick. Man, you get him started, that guy can drink. I mean, we can drink, but he's got, like, the Can Drink gold medal."
12,17,Sam,"Hey, you talk to Mom lately?"
12,17,Dean,Would you want your mom working with him?
12,17,Mick,"Well, I can't say. I never really knew my mum. Or my dad. I was on the streets till the Men of Letters found me."
12,17,Sam,How did they find you?
12,17,Mick,"I, uh, picked a member's pocket. Not on purpose. I was just after a couple of quid. But I got a cursed coin from ancient Babylon instead."
12,17,Dean,"Yeah, sure. That could happen to anyone."
12,17,Mick,"The Men of Letters decided I showed promised and signed me up. They gave me a life. They, um... [he gazes into space]"
12,17,Sam,You all right?
12,17,Mick,Yeah. Always. [Picking up his glass of tomato juice] Got any vodka?
12,17,Doctor,Hello. You must be Kelly. And you're her...partner?
12,17,Dagon,No.
12,17,Doctor,Birth coach.
12,17,Dagon,Sure.
12,17,Doctor,"Well, Kelly's vitals and preliminary labs were great. So we're just gonna do a quick sonogram."
12,17,Dagon,Is that really necessary?
12,17,Kelly,Of course it is.
12,17,Doctor,"Want the baby to be a happy camper. Right over here. Okay, Kelly. Just lift up there, please.
Thank you. I'm gonna put a little bit of gel on the camera, so it might be a little bit cold."
12,17,Doctor,Okay. Say cheese.
12,17,Dagon,Cheese.
12,17,Doctor,Okay. Uh-huh. Ah. It's looking good.
12,17,Doctor,Oh. Hmm. Hmm.
12,17,Kelly,What?
12,17,Doctor,Everything looks a-okay!
12,17,Dagon,"See, Kelly? Your baby is a little angel, just like I've been saying."
12,17,Doctor,"Now I know this can be a little bit awkward, but for the little champ's medical record, what can you tell me about his father?"
12,17,Crowley,"How the mighty have sunk, eh? Good puppy. [Crowley rubs Lucifer's hair and then throws a ball] Puppy want to play?"
12,17,Crowley,What's the matter?
12,17,Crowley,What are you doing?
12,17,Lucifer,I'm giving you what you want... submission.
12,17,Crowley,Why?
12,17,Lucifer,"Why not? I figured out the rules of the house, and...well, all things considered, think I'd rather be here than rotting in the Cage with my drooling, insane – and not in a fun way – little bro Michael."
12,17,Crowley,Really?
12,17,Lucifer,"Yes. It's your game, your rules, so, uh... I figure I can work with that. You win. What now... sire?"
12,17,Mick,Ketch.
12,17,Ketch,Quick update... the skels turned out to be shape-shifters. Killed a clan of seven.
12,17,Mary,Eight.
12,17,Ketch,"Eight, she says. I've learned not to argue. Um, you'll make with the typey typey, yes?"
12,17,Mick,I'll file the report.
12,17,Ketch,Splendid. Ciao.
12,17,Mary,So you and Mick... longtime friends?
12,17,Ketch,More...survivors than friends. We were in school together.
12,17,Mary,"Ah. Major in murder, minor in mayhem?"
12,17,Ketch,Mm. Yeah. Mm. I gather your training was a bit more...improvisational?
12,17,Mary,We learned on the job.
12,17,Ketch,And then you... gave it all up.
12,17,Mary,"I wanted a quiet, normal life."
12,17,Ketch,"Mm. And yet, there you were, up to your elbows in shifter guts. Mrs. Winchester... I believe you're drawn to danger."
12,17,Ketch,Cheers.
12,17,Renny Rawlings,"Sorry to interrupt. There's really no need for that, Mr. Davies."
12,17,Mick,We know each other?
12,17,Renny,I'm Renny. Rawlings. I've been working directly for Dr. Hess since I graduated Kendricks. Top of my class.
12,17,Mick,Oh. Cheers. What do you want?
12,17,Renny,Dr. Hess sent me on the overnight. Thought you could use an extra set of hands.
12,17,Mick,"Oh. Oh, to put it another way, you're her lapdog. Here to keep an eye on me."
12,17,Renny,I'm here to help.
12,17,Mick,You want to help? Stay out of my way.
12,17,Renny,I'm afraid that's not an option.
12,17,Doctor,"Sorry, we're closed for the day."
12,17,Man,Those your patient files?
12,17,Doctor,My patient history is none of your business.
12,17,Doctor,Aah!
12,17,Cas [voicemail],This is my voicemail. Make your voice a mail.
12,17,Sam,So you ran the plates of every car that drove past that warehouse in Idaho just before it burned down?
12,17,Eileen,"Yeah. Most of them were local, but one wasn't. It came up registered to Dermott Culp."
12,17,Sam,So...
12,17,Eileen,So he went missing a year ago.
12,17,Sam,Okay.
12,17,Eileen,I tracked his car to Iowa. Found him coming out of a building carrying a dead body.
12,17,Dean,So Dermott's a killer?
12,17,Eileen,Dermott's a demon.
12,17,Demon,Hunter.
12,17,Eileen,Demon.
12,17,Sam,"Uh, one of Crowley's?"
12,17,Eileen,Works for Dagon. Covers her tracks.
12,17,Sam,Smart.
12,17,Dean,"Dude, don't compliment the bad guys."
12,17,Sam,Uh... So do you know where Kelly is now?
12,17,Eileen,"No, but before Dermott got stabbed in the heart..."
12,17,Dean,Nice.
12,17,Eileen,Mm-hmm. He gave me her phone number.
12,17,Sam,"Yeah, nice."
12,17,Crowley,"My loyal...ish subjects, these troubled times, I'm aware there might be some confusion as to where you're supposed to place your loyalty. Even with Lucifer back in the Cage, there are those of you who would try to help him... because he scares you or engorges you. Just the chance that Lucifer could come back, the rumor, would've been enough to keep some of you working against me, undermining me, being a royal pain in my... pert, royal ass. But lo, the beast has been humbled."
12,17,Crowley,"From his own lips, you will hear proclaimed the one, true leader of all Hell. See... I didn't just beat the Devil. I tamed him. This is all done of your own free will, is it not?"
12,17,Lucifer,"Yes, my Lord."
12,17,Crowley,"Look, kids. He goes where I tell him. He does what I tell him. He is my dog. Showtime, Marmaduke."
12,17,Lucifer,"Yes, my Lord. He's right, my friends. There is only one true ruler of Hell. [Lucifer silently mouths me. Crowley cannot see what he is doing.]"
12,17,Crowley,"And that is me, is it not?"
12,17,Lucifer,"Oh, yes."
12,17,Crowley,And you surrender your heartfelt support to that one true ruler?
12,17,Lucifer,"Absolutely. [He winks at the demons, who look confused.]"
12,17,Crowley,And what do you have to say to those who are still unsure of whom they must obey?
12,17,Lucifer,"I say this – anyone who does not support this one true king, can be assured of suffering unendurable and everlasting agony. [Lucifer's eyes burn red]"
12,17,Lucifer [smirking],I don't hear applause.
12,17,Kelly,Dr Turner was very specific. I need zinc and iron.
12,17,Dagon,"Yeah, got it."
12,17,Kelly,And this article says calcium.
12,17,Dagon,Cool. Bye.
12,17,Kelly,Yes?
12,17,Sam,This is Oliver in Dr. Turner's office. He'd like to see you in the office today.
12,17,Kelly,"I, uh, I was just in there. He said everything was fine."
12,17,Kelly,I-I-I don't think I can get away.
12,17,Kelly,Um... sure.
12,17,Eileen,Cool.
12,17,Sam,I thought you'd be coming alone.
12,17,Mick,"Well, I thought we'd gotten past our trust issues. Look, if Dagon shows, we're gonna need all the help we can get. [He nods towards Renny]. This is Renny Rawlings. New man."
12,17,Sam,Right. I'm Sam. This is Eileen Leahy.
12,17,Renny,"Ah, the banshee girl."
12,17,Renny,"We have a file. From what Mick tells me, neither of you have any formal training. Fascinating. I was top of my class at Kendricks..."
12,17,Eileen,No one cares.
12,17,Mick,"I, uh, brought the Colt just like you asked. But it's gotta go back to HQ."
12,17,Sam,"Gee, Mick, I thought we'd gotten past the trust issues."
12,17,Mick,Hmm.
12,17,Dean,Stay cool. Walk with me.
12,17,Kelly,Dean?
12,17,Dean,This everyone?
12,17,Sam,Yeah. Still no word from Cass.
12,17,Dean,Right. Great. [Pointing at Renny] Who's this?
12,17,Sam,He's with Mick.
12,17,Renny,I'm Renny Rawlings. Graduated Kendricks top of my...
12,17,Dean,Right. I don't care.
12,17,Dean,Come on.
12,17,Kelly,Don't.
12,17,Dean,Okay.
12,17,Sam,"Kelly... Listen, we... we all know you're in a really... difficult situation, and we... we just... We wanna help."
12,17,Kelly,You call this helping?
12,17,Dean,"Look, Kelly, that kid, it's... I mean, it can't... I mean, it's Lucifer's."
12,17,Kelly,"Yeah, I know. You think I wanted this to happen? He used me. But I love this child."
12,17,Mick,You will mean absolutely nothing to that child. That child will kill us all.
12,17,Dean,Hey.
12,17,Sam,"That's... that's not happening, okay? We're... we're gonna figure something out. We will. We..."
12,17,Dean,Don't.
12,17,Kelly,She's here.
12,17,Dagon,Hey.
12,17,Eileen,I didn't... I didn't mean to. I was shooting at the demon. I'm –
12,17,Sam,"No, no, wait up. It was an accident. It's all right."
12,17,Dean,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?"
12,17,Sam,Hey!
12,17,Mick,She killed a Man of Letters. S-she has to die.
12,17,Sam,It was an accident!
12,17,Mick,It doesn't matter! The Code.
12,17,Dean,"No, hey, screw the Code."
12,17,Mick,Don't make this harder than it already is.
12,17,Dean,"Mick, you don't have to do this."
12,17,Mick,"Yes, I do!"
12,17,Eileen,Please. Don't.
12,17,Timothy,Please. Please don't.
12,17,Dr Hess,The Code demands otherwise.
12,17,Timothy,Please. Please!
12,17,Sam,"Mick, Mick, listen to me. Mick, look, I-I know you guys h-have this Men of Letters Code you blindly answer to, but... look, you don't have to do that, Mick. You're better than that. You only have to answer to yourself. You only have to do what you know is right. You only have to answer to your own code."
12,17,Mick,Just go.
12,17,Sam,Yeah.
12,17,Ketch,"Well, that was unexpected. But invigorating. I must say, when I first met you, I didn't see this coming. My thought at the time was, I'll end up shooting this one. Hmm. Life is full of surprises."
12,17,Mary,Ketch.
12,17,Ketch,Yes?
12,17,Mary,You're not...reading anything into this.
12,17,Ketch,Like?
12,17,Mary,Like... it means anything.
12,17,Ketch,"Oh. It... You really needn't worry. I... Truth is, I'm not... built for that. And I suspect you aren't either."
12,17,Mary,You're wrong. But that was a long time ago. So we're good?
12,17,Ketch,We are. And I notice you took my advice.
12,17,Mary,Advice?
12,17,Ketch,You had a choice to make... your work or family ties.
12,17,Mary,You know what? It's not either/or. I have the same discussion with my boys. I'm not choosing hunting over them. Why does it have to be one or the other?
12,17,Ketch,So you want to have it all?
12,17,Mary,Tryin' to.
12,17,Ketch,Good for you.
12,17,Lucifer,So how we lookin'?
12,17,Demon,You're sure Crowley is occupied elsewhere?
12,17,Lucifer,"Yeah, he's on his rounds. Crowley's got, like, two and a half more hours of gettin' his pert, royal ass kissed."
12,17,Demon,"Well, upper left quadrant is sound. Restoration's holding. No laminations detected. Lower left, likewise."
12,17,Lucifer,"You made the right decision, you know. 'Cause when the dust settles, there's only gonna be one of us standing... and it ain't gonna be the guy with the accent, if you know what I mean. I'm very, very impressed."
12,17,Demon,Uh... You'll be happy to know the... the vessel is completely sound. The repairs are secure.
12,17,Lucifer,"And the security system? Whatever it is that lets Crowley turn me into his own personal
sock puppet."
12,17,Lucifer,I don't hear words.
12,17,Demon,The... the s-system is very much i-intact.
12,17,Lucifer,But you can disarm it?
12,17,Lucifer,I'm not really known for my patience.
12,17,Demon,I don't quite have the means...
12,17,Lucifer,Who does?
12,17,Demon,Spivak. He designed...
12,17,Lucifer,Where is he?
12,17,Demon,Dead.
12,17,Lucifer,Dead?
12,17,Demon,Dead.
12,17,Demon,"Uh, yeah, after the system was installed, Crowley killed Spivak to safeguard its secrets."
12,17,Lucifer,"Mm. Well... You can crack it, right?"
12,17,Demon [nervously],Y-yeah. I just need some time. I'll... I'll be quick.
12,17,Lucifer,Good. 'Cause I am gettin' stir crazy. And I'm about to be a dad.
12,17,Kelly,Why are you doing this?
12,17,Dagon,"Oh, don't even. I tried, but clearly, you can't be trusted."
12,17,Kelly,I was worried about the baby. I'm trying to protect him.
12,17,Dagon,"Oh, honey. You can't. I mean, you don't need to. I wasn't lying. Your baby's strong, so strong. Whatever happens, he is going to be just fine. But you... won't. Yeah, those weird little pains? Just a taste of what's to come. 'Cause, you know, birthing a Nephilim? Fatal. Always."
12,17,Mick,Ketch. Why'd you call me here?
12,17,Ketch,"Oh, I didn't."
12,17,Dr Hess,Mr. Davies.
12,17,Mick,Dr. Hess. I didn't think you left London.
12,17,Dr Hess,I don't. But I have been tasked by the other elders to fix this rapidly deteriorating situation.
12,17,Mick,"Ma'am, please. I'm..."
12,17,Dr Hess,"Are you about to tell me that you are doing the best that you can? Two days ago, according to your own report, you let a Prince of Hell escape and the mother of Lucifer's child. And one of my best men was murdered by an American Hunter, whom you allowed to live."
12,17,Mick,If I might...
12,17,Dr Hess,"These Hunters are out of control. The brothers Winchester, in particular, which Lady Bevell has exhaustively documented."
12,17,Mick,"Ma'am, if... if you could just listen..."
12,17,Dr Hess,To what? More excuses?
12,17,Dr Hess,"No. I don't think I will. Hunters are dogs, Mr. Davies. You give them an order, and they obey. That's how it works. So tell me, do they? Do they obey you?"
12,17,Dr Hess,"No. Of course not. So... this Eileen Leahy will be found and killed in accordance with the Code. As for the Winchesters, like any rebellious Hunter, they will be investigated. And, if found guilty, executed."
12,17,Mick,If they're found guilty? Aren't Hunters always found guilty?
12,17,Dr Hess,"Be careful, Mr. Davies."
12,17,Mick,"No. My entire life with the Men of Letters, I never broke a rule. And yes, at first I was shocked at how Sam and Dean operate. But what Lady Bevell doesn't mention is the lives they've saved, monsters destroyed, and outcomes made better not because of the Code, but because of Sam and Dean Winchester's sense of what's right."
12,17,Dr Hess,And that is the crux of the matter. The Code is not a suggestion. It's an absolute. The Code is what separates us from the monsters. It is the order by which we all live.
12,17,Mick,"No. The code is what makes a young boy kill his best friend. When I was a child, I had nothing. I owed you everything, and I obeyed. But I'm a man now, Dr. Hess..."
12,17,Mick,"...and I can see the choices, and I choose to do the right thing."
12,17,Dean,Mornin'.
12,17,Sam,"Mornin'. Hey, you, uh, you hear anything from Cass yet?"
12,17,Dean,Mm. No. Still MIA.
12,17,Sam,You think he's all right?
12,17,Dean,I don't know. [Looking around] Where's Eileen?
12,17,Sam,"She took off. Uh, said she's heading back to Ireland for a while. Just needs some time, I guess."
12,17,Dean,"Mm. Yeah, I get that."
12,17,Sam,Mm.
12,17,Dean,"Ah. Welcome back, sweetheart."
12,17,Dr Hess,The grand experiment recruiting American Hunters has failed. Utterly.
12,17,Ketch,Mm. What would you like me to do?
12,17,Dr Hess,Exterminate them. Every...last...one.
12,17,EILEEN,It's Kelly Kline. I think I found her.
12,18,EXTERIOR,"IN THE WOODS OF TOMAHAWK, WISCONSIN. A GROUP OF YOUNG COUPLES PARTIES AROUND A CAMPFIRE IN THE WOODS LATE AT NIGHT. TWO BOYS SIT APART FROM THE REST OF THE ROMANTICALLY ENGAGED COUPLES."
12,18,JARROD,"Yeah, I think I'm gonna go."
12,18,DARYN,What?
12,18,JARROD,"I got work tomorrow, so..."
12,18,DARYN,"Naw, dude. Stick around. Have another beer. Enjoy the show. (smiling while looking at  the couples kissing)"
12,18,JARROD,"You know you're a freak, right?"
12,18,DARYN,"Oh, yeah. (toast and clink the bottle of beer)"
12,18,JARROD,"Cheers, bud."
12,18,JARROD,"Hey. Ohh, man. Dude. Daryn! What is this, man? Hey, real funny, Daryn! Ha ha! Hey! Daryn?"
12,18,JARROD,"No. No. No, no, no!"
12,18,DEAN,"Come on. Cas, it's me. I've been trying to get ahold of you for days. I don't know what's going on, but we got a line on Dagon...And we got our asses handed to us, even with the Colt. So...Could really use the backup. Call me back."
12,18,SAM,"So no luck with Cas, huh?"
12,18,DEAN,"Yeah, still AWOL."
12,18,SAM,"All right, so let's find him."
12,18,DEAN,"I've been trying, Sam. The GPS on his phone is turned off, and there's nothing in the system about some weird guy in a trench coat getting arrested or turning up dead."
12,18,SAM,"Right. Dean, it's Cas. I mean, this isn't the first time he's dropped off the map, you know? And whatever's happening, he'll be fine. He always is."
12,18,DEAN,Yeah.
12,18,DEAN,"What 'bout you? You got anything there, reading rainbow?"
12,18,SAM,"I stayed up all night, going through every book we have on demons, and it turns out we have a lot of books on demons."
12,18,DEAN,Anything on Dagon?
12,18,SAM,"Mentions here and there, but nothing we can use. I guess the, uh, Princes of Hell are pretty good at staying off the radar."
12,18,DEAN,"Well, yeah, isn't that kind of their thing?"
12,18,SAM,Hmm. Just got an e-mail from Mick.  It's a case.
12,18,DEAN,Good.
12,18,SAM,"Looks like a guy named Jarrod Hayes disappeared in tomahawk, Wisconsin, a week ago. No witnesses. No body. But Mick says this place has a history."
12,18,DEAN,Meaning?
12,18,SAM,"Well, it means a lot of people go missing in tomahawk, one a year, every year, from 1898 to 1997, and then nothing until now."
12,18,DEAN,So 20 years?
12,18,SAM,Yeah. So maybe they're starting up again? Maybe it's a cycle of some sort?
12,18,DEAN,Well...One way to find out. (while pointing the gun)  Pew.
12,18,MR. KETCH,"(who receives Sam's message, and announces to a group of associates). It's time."
12,18,INTERIOR,"In Tomahawk, Sam and Dean visit Sheriff Barrett Bishop, Jr.'s office. He’s preoccupied with sewing a taxidermy animal, and seems disinterested in Jarrod's disappearance."
12,18,DEAN,Just followin' orders.
12,18,SAM,"Yeah, um...So what can you tell us about the case?"
12,18,DEAN,So somebody snagged him?
12,18,SAM,Maybe?
12,18,DEAN,And why would he do that?
12,18,SAM,Wait a second.
12,18,DEAN,Mm.
12,18,SAM,"If you knew he was being abused, why didn't you –"
12,18,DEAN,Did you talk to his old man?
12,18,DEAN,You said that he was with friends the night Jarrod went missing.
12,18,SAM,"Yeah, did any of them say anything?"
12,18,DEAN,Uh-huh. Any idea where we can find these friends?
12,18,SAM,"Daryn Boston? Agents Stark and Martell, FBI."
12,18,DARYN,Hell.
12,18,DEAN,"Yeah, no, it's cool. Medicinal purposes, right?"
12,18,DARY,Uh...Yes?
12,18,DEAN,Yeah.
12,18,SAM,"We just, uh, wanted to talk about the night Jarrod Hayes went missing."
12,18,DARYN,What about it?
12,18,SAM,"Well, the sheriff says you were with him."
12,18,DARYN,"Yeah, well, the sheriff is a jackass, all right? Look, he thinks Jarrod just skipped town."
12,18,SAM,You don't?
12,18,DARYN,I know he didn't.
12,18,DEAN,Did you tell that to the cops?
12,18,DARYN,"Man, sheriff bishop's not gonna believe me. We got...history."
12,18,DEAN,History?
12,18,DARYN,"Any time something happens in this town, he brings me in for questioning."
12,18,SAM,Why is that?
12,18,DARYN,Why do you think?
12,18,SAM,Right.
12,18,DEAN,"Well, look, if you won't tell the sheriff what you saw, how 'bout you tell us?"
12,18,Jarrod,Hey! Daryn!
12,18,DARYN,"Look, I ran to save Jarrod, okay? But..."
12,18,JARROD,"No, no, no!"
12,18,DARYN,"The monster, it got him."
12,18,DEAN,Monster?
12,18,DARYN,Black Bill.
12,18,INTERIOR,"In a cafe that evening, Sam is researching the local legend of Black Bill while Dean is visibly distracted by their waitress."
12,18,WAITRESS,Hi!
12,18,SAM,"""Black Bill"" is a local urban legend, dates back more than a hundred years."
12,18,WAITRESS,Warm it up?
12,18,DEAN,Thank you.
12,18,SAM,"A folklore story from 1907 that – that mentions that... Uh, back then, he was called ""Black 
William."" So it looks like some time between then and... Dude, focus."
12,18,DEAN,"I am focused. Yeah, Black Bill. What do you got?"
12,18,SAM,"all right, well, he lives in the woods, so he's like a local Jersey devil. And apparently, he has the head of a goat."
12,18,DEAN,A goat? Like... . Goat?
12,18,SAM,"Yeah, a goat."
12,18,DEAN,"Well, maybe that's what Daryn saw."
12,18,SAM,Unless you think he was lying.
12,18,WAITRESS,Yeah. Be right back.
12,18,DEAN,"Mm, nah, I think he's a little too freaked out to be lying. So we got a, uh, goat dude with a name like a pirate, which is a little insane, even for us. And that bar is... super high (whistling while looking at the waitress). So if it is real, what the hell is it?"
12,18,SAM,"I’m not sure. I mean, there's tons of human-animal hybrid lore dating back all the way to ancient Egypt."
12,18,DEAN,"Right, well, why don't you figure out what the hell it is, and I'll figure out a way to kill it. Okay?"
12,18,SAM,All right.
12,18,DEAN,Right. Don't wait up.
12,18,SAM,What?
12,18,DEAN,I already figured out a way to kill it.
12,18,SAM,How did you – you don't even know what it is.
12,18,DEAN,"The Colt. Dusts anything. Work smarter, Sammy, not harder."
12,18,SAM,"Oh, don't do the hot coffee thing."
12,18,DEAN,"Boy, this coffee is hot. Kind of like... Hi. What's your name?"
12,18,WAITRESS,Carmen.
12,18,INTERIOR,"at the meat-packing factory where Daryn works, Daryn was shocked when his boss, Pete Garfinkle, appeared out of nowhere while closing the fridge door."
12,18,PETE,Sorry.
12,18,DARYN,"Damn it, Pete!"
12,18,PETE,"Daryn... I don't wanna be the bad guy here, but... You clocked in late. Again."
12,18,DARYN,"Yeah, and?"
12,18,PETE,"And you're really painting me in a corner here, pal. Look, I know – I know that you and Jarrod, you were close. And I liked him, too. He was a-a valued employee and he was a friend."
12,18,DARYN,Really?
12,18,PETE,Yeah.
12,18,DARYN,"'Cause after you put him on part-time, he pretty much hated you."
12,18,PETE,"Well, I would say that that was his prerogative. But you can't keep using him as an excuse to blow off work. Okay?"
12,18,DARYN,Yeah. Okay.
12,18,PETE,"Daryn, Daryn. One more thing. You gotta lay off the reefer. All right? At least for tomorrow. It's a big day."
12,18,DARYN,Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!
12,18,DEAN,I'll see you later. Okay.
12,18,SAM,Mm.
12,18,Man,Order up.
12,18,DEAN,Ahh.
12,18,SAM,Good night?
12,18,DEAN,Awesome. It was an awesome night. So awesome. Ah. You gonna eat that?
12,18,SAM,Uh... (while Dean steals Sam's veggie omelette) Guess not. Be my guest.
12,18,DEAN,"I mean, would it kill you to order pancakes? Once?"
12,18,SAM,"Okay, fine. You — (Sam tries to take his food back)"
12,18,DEAN,"No, no. No. I'll deal. How was your night?"
12,18,SAM,"Busy. A different kind of a busy, but good."
12,18,DEAN,Right. Books. Anything on goat dude?
12,18,SAM,"Yeah, little bit. I have some idea what we're dealing with. Look at this. It's a satyr – half man, half goat from Greek mythology."
12,18,DEAN,"Oh, come on. This guy's adorable. He plays a freakin' flute."
12,18,SAM,"Yeah, Dean. That's – that's Pan. It's his flute."
12,18,DEAN,Mm.
12,18,SAM,"So listen, satyrs are creatures of uncontrollable lust. They would lead people to the woods for massive orgies."
12,18,DEAN,Nice.
12,18,SAM,"And when the fun was over, the satyr would, ""feast upon the flesh of his victims until his belly was full to bursting with their moist, slippery meat."""
12,18,DEAN,"That's descriptive. Uh... All right, what do we do?"
12,18,SAM,"Well, I was thinking that maybe we could go talk to Daryn, see if this is, indeed, what he saw."
12,18,DEAN,But?
12,18,SAM,But his mom told me Daryn never made it home from work last night.
12,18,INTERIOR,They return to Billhook Meats and speak with Pete looking for Daryn.
12,18,PETE,"No screwups, right?"
12,18,SAM,"Excuse me, sir. Hi. Agents Stark and Martell, FBI. Uh, we're looking for Daryn Boston."
12,18,PETE,"Uh, Daryn? Is he in trouble?"
12,18,SAM,"No, no, no, not at all. We – we spoke with him yesterday. Just wanna ask a few follow-up questions. I don't suppose he's around."
12,18,PETE,"No, Daryn – Daryn didn't show up for work today."
12,18,DEAN,So when was the last time you saw him?
12,18,PETE,"Oh, last night. Closed up. Talked about our big day today."
12,18,DEAN,What big day?
12,18,PETE,You see that walking clipboard over there?
12,18,Sam,Yeah.
12,18,PETE,That's a health inspector. He's trying to shut us down.
12,18,SAM,How come? This place is spotless.
12,18,PETE,"It cleans up pretty nice, but our equipment, it's a little out of date."
12,18,DEAN,Can't you upgrade?
12,18,PETE,"Yeah. Barrett Bishop, Jr.  Heir to the bishop meat empire. His family, they've owned this plant for...forever. Barry's inside. He's hopin' to sweet talk the inspector. You ask me, it's too little, way  too late."
12,18,Man,Mr. Garfinkle.
12,18,PETE,Excuse me.
12,18,SAM,Sure.
12,18,DEAN,"So we roll into town, look into a case, talk to the local badge..."
12,18,SAM,And then our one witness goes missing. Last place he was seen owned by the sheriff. Sound like a coincidence?
12,18,DEAN,"Oh. You hungry? I'm hungry. (While roaming around, they find Sheriff Bishop a few moments later.)"
12,18,SAM,"Excuse me, sheriff."
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,Agents. What are you guys doin' here?
12,18,DEAN,"Well, we could ask you the same thing, except...Oh, right. You run the joint."
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,"Well, my name's on the paperwork. Pete handles the day to day. Are you still trying to chase down Jarrod Hayes?"
12,18,SAM,"Yeah, and, uh, now Daryn Boston."
12,18,DEAN,"Yeah. Seems to have gone missing, too."
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,Jeez. First I've heard of it.
12,18,SAM,"Yeah. So tell us, what have you heard about Black Bill?"
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,I'm sorry.
12,18,SAM,Black Bill. Daryn told us he saw Black Bill attack Jarrod Hayes.
12,18,DEAN,He didn't wanna tell ya 'cause he didn't think you'd believe him.
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,"Well – well... Yeah. He's right. Look, 'round here, parents tell their kids not to go into the woods or Black Bill will get 'em. He's the bogeyman. Everyone knows that the bogeyman ain't real."
12,18,DEAN,"Sure about that? Seems like a lot of people go missing in this town. Yeah, one a year every year up until '97."
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,"Yeah. Okay. I mean, people come to town, they work in the plant for a while, then they get bored and restless, and they, you know, move on."
12,18,SAM,And Daryn?
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,"You know, maybe Daryn thinks he say Black Bill, but let's be honest. Kid was drunk, high, or both. And I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts, Daryn's just holed up, sleeping one off. Hell, he's probably waking up right now, safe and sound."
12,18,INTERIOR,"Meanwhile Daryn is waking up, but he's not safe and sound. He's in a red-lit freezer inside the factory. He bangs on the door yelling for help."
12,18,DARYN,"Hey!  Help, please! Help! Help me!"
12,18,DEAN,"Well, sheriff's not acting suspicious at all."
12,18,SAM,Right.
12,18,DEAN,"Yeah, but how is he connected to goat dude?"
12,18,SAM,Now that's a good question.
12,18,DARYN,Help! help! Help! Please! Help me! Help! Help! Help!  Help! Aah!
12,18,INTERIOR,Dean's eating a burger at the cafe.
12,18,SAM,"Seriously? Dean? After what we just saw, how – how can you eat?"
12,18,SAM,"Grow up, Sam, okay? Burger's beef, bacon's pig, Soylent Green's people.  But this – this... This is heaven."
12,18,SAM,"Wow. Right. Um, so, uh, what's the word? You find anything?"
12,18,DEAN,"Mm. Yeah, kind of. So I cross-checked all the names of the people who went missing with the employee roster at Billhook Meats."
12,18,SAM,And? Any more of the vics work at the plant?
12,18,DEAN,Try all of 'em.
12,18,SAM,"All of 'em? Seriously? So I guess that means, safe to say that, uh, Black Bill is definitely connected to the plant?"
12,18,DEAN,"Yeah. Or the family that runs it. Or both. Well, maybe they just run an evil petting zoo on the side."
12,18,SAM,"So I, uh, spent some time at the hall of records. The Bishops founded tomahawk. Everything. This is a company town. If you lived here, you worked at the plant. The Bishops owned all the houses, all the businesses. Or they did until a few years ago. Looks like the sheriff has been selling off all of their family property. Uh, everything, really..."
12,18,DEAN,Hmm. (continues eating)
12,18,SAM,...for the plant and the family estate.
12,18,DEAN,Wow. So who lives at the Addams family house?
12,18,SAM,It's Mick.
12,18,DEAN,Okay. Tell him we're cool.
12,18,SAM,So creepy house?
12,18,DEAN,Creepy house.
12,18,INTERIOR,"Ketch again receives Sam's text, as he and his men break into the bunker to investigate Sam and Dean."
12,18,KETCH,"It's clear. Onward. Now remember your orders. By the time we leave, Dr. Hess wants to know everything about our ""friends"" the Winchesters – their allies, their habits. How does Sam get his hair so shiny? How many ratty flannels does Dean own? So work quick, work quiet, and leave no trace. Oh, and apparently, Mick let Sam and Dean get their hands on the bloody Colt. Find it, huh?"
12,18,EXTERIOR,Sam and Dean arrive at the Barrett family mansion and break into the abandoned house.
12,18,SAM,Looks empty.
12,18,DEAN,"Well, why don't we check inside? Maybe we'll get lucky."
12,18,SAM,Dean.
12,18,SAM,"Dean, I'd say we just got lucky."
12,18,Dean,"Wow.  Hello? Goat dude? Why is it always the rich ones? I mean, what, are they, like, ""Croquet's all right. But you know what'd be great? Murder."" (Sheriff Barrett arrives while they're exploring what looks like a murder room.) Hiya, sheriff."
12,18,INTERIOR,"Inside Barrett family mansion, Sam and Dean question the Sheriff."
12,18,DEAN,Talk.
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,This is not what it looks like. Really?
12,18,DEAN,'Cause it looks like a straight up murder room to me.
12,18,SAM,"Sheriff, what's goin' on?"
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,"Oh, you... You won't believe me."
12,18,DEAN,Try us. We're pretty open mind.
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,"My family, we... got a secret."
12,18,DEAN,All the best ones do.
12,18,SAM,Is this about Black Bill?
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,"No. I mean, yeah, but...He's not real. Black Bill, he's...us."
12,18,DEAN,Come again?
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,"Uh... Growing up, my father'd tell me stories about a monster. Lived under our house and made our family rich.  All we had to do was – was feed it."
12,18,SAM,Feed it what?
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,"Blood. Human blood. My dad, his dad, and all the way back, they'd go out and grab some poor son of a bitch, bring 'em here and... when they did it they wore a mask. Black Bill...We made him up."
12,18,DEAN,So goat dude is just a dude?
12,18,SAM,Then who's the monster?
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,Moloch. God of sacrifice.
12,18,DEAN,"What, I'm sorry. You – you have a god living in your basement?"
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,"Yeah, one of my people way back, they bound Moloch, locked him away... Starved him. My family, that's what we did. We let the god get so hungry that he'd do anything for blood."
12,18,MAN,Aah!
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,"Moloch used his power to make us rich. After my father died in '97, I put a stop to all of that. Look, I couldn't...I never killed anybody. I just wanted to help people to make up for all the bad we've done. I wanted... To leave a legacy."
12,18,DEAN,"Well, aren't you just a peach?"
12,18,SAM,So what happened to Moloch?
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,I kept him locked up. Hoped he'd starve to death.
12,18,DEAN,Locked up where?
12,18,SAM,(checks the cage) It's empty.
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,What?
12,18,SAM,It's empty.
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,"No, no. No, no, no, no, no."
12,18,DEAN,Stay here. Keep an eye on him.
12,18,SAM,"What? Dean, there could be a god up there. I'm cool."
12,18,DEAN,Aah!
12,18,SAM,Dean?
12,18,SAM,Hey! Hey! Open up! Hey!
12,18,INTERIOR,Sam tries to break the door down and Barrett brings him a meat cleaver to smash the door.
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,Here. Here.
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,What are you doing?
12,18,SAM,"I'm trying to track Dean's cellphone. All right, got it. Let's go."
12,18,KETCH,Just as I thought. Can't see a damn thing.
12,18,DEAN,"Mm. Hiya, Pete. Nice digs."
12,18,PETE,"I didn't expect to see you again, agent. I went to the house looking for my brother."
12,18,DEAN,Brother?
12,18,PETE,"Barry. Different moms, same daddy. Old man Bishop, he, uh, he had an eye for the ladies. Everyone in town knew about it, but didn't make a difference. Barry grew up in the big house. I grew up in a double wide. Does that sound fair to you?"
12,18,DEAN,"Honestly? Sounds like a bad episode of ""dynasty."""
12,18,PETE,You got a lot of jokes.
12,18,DEAN,"Yeah, right now, that's about all I got."
12,18,PETE,Right. You know what I got? A god.
12,18,DEAN,Moloch.
12,18,PETE,"Bingo! With Barry giving away the family fortune like that, I had to get creative.  I went to the old house, trying to get my hands on. anything I could sell. But I found somethin' else. Moloch. He told me he'd make me rich. He told me he'd solve all my problems. All I had to do was  feed him. And hell, I'm a Bishop. That's what we do, right? Hunting people. Killing them. The family business. Moloch's been starved for 20 years. It's gonna take a few meals for him to get his mojo goin', but then... Oh, we are back, baby.  Yeah. I'm savin' this town."
12,18,DEAN,"Well, I'll tell that to Jarrod and Daryn."
12,18,PETE,"Jarrod was a screw up. He got what he deserved. And Daryn? Well, sorry, bud, but once he talked, he had to go. Loose ends, you know? Loose ends. Come on!"
12,18,DEAN,Mm.
12,18,PETE,"My jackass half-brother was supposed to be the next meal, but you'll do."
12,18,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. W– Pete, let's just talk about this. Listen... Let's –"
12,18,PETE,It'll be over soon. Thanks for helpin' out!
12,18,DEAN,What...
12,18,INTERIOR,"In the bunker, Ketch and his team finish their inventory of the bunker."
12,18,BMOL,"The sweep's complete, sir. We've photographed and catalogued every inch."
12,18,Ketch,And the Colt?
12,18,BMOL,I'm afraid not. The Winchesters must have it. Bugger.  Shall we go?
12,18,Ketch,"Yes. Just one last thing.  (Ketch plants a bug under the war room map table.) Now then, I could use a pint."
12,18,INTERIOR,"Back in the freezer, Dean wheels himself around and spots Daryn's body being dragged away by the monster, and he fights to break free of the plastic bindings."
12,18,DEAN,Pete! Pete!
12,18,SAM,Dean?
12,18,SAM,Dean?
12,18,SAM,Dean?
12,18,DEAN,"Come on, you son of a bitch. Huh."
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,Pete! You have to stop.
12,18,Pete,Don't act like you care.
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,I gave you the plant.
12,18,PETE,"Aw, because you knew it was failing. What a bunch of crap. That's what I get. I get that my whole life! The crap!"
12,18,DEAN,Ah!
12,18,PETE,Not anymore. I'm saving this town. I'm the hero. And you're dead.
12,18,DEAN,Mm.
12,18,SAM,Colt. Dusts anything.
12,18,INTERIOR,"At the Billhook Meats plant, While Barrett crouches over his dead brother in the background. Dean holds a frozen steak to his bruised temple."
12,18,SAM,Hey. How you feelin'?
12,18,DEAN,"Like I just went 12 rounds with a god. So, you know...Normal."
12,18,SAM,Yeah.
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,You should go.
12,18,SAM,"No, sheriff, uh, we can help clean up."
12,18,Sheriff Bishop,No. This...I'll take care of it. It's on me. This? This is my legacy.
12,18,INTERIOR,"Back at the bunker, Sam and Dean sit in the library wondering what their legacy will be, if they’ll be remembered a hundred years from now."
12,18,DEAN,Hey.
12,18,SAM,Yep.
12,18,DEAN,"Next time you hear me say that our family is messed up, remind me that we could be psycho goat people."
12,18,SAM,"Yeah, that's true enough."
12,18,DEAN,"You know, I was... Thinking about what bishop said. About...What do you think our legacy's gonna be? When we're gone, I mean, after all the stuff we've done, you think folks will remember us? You know, like, a hundred years from now?"
12,18,SAM,No.
12,18,DEAN,"Oh, that's nice."
12,18,SAM,"Well, I mean... Guys like us, we're not exactly the type of people they write about in history books, you know?"
12,18,DEAN,Mm.
12,18,SAM,"But the people we saved, they're our legacy. And they'll remember us and then I guess...We'll eventually fade away, too. That's fine, because we left the world better than we found it, you know."
12,18,DEAN,"I wonder what's gonna happen to this place. After we're gone, you think some hunter'll move in, keep fightin' the fight?"
12,18,SAM,"Yeah, I hope so."
12,18,DEAN,"Yeah. Me, too."
12,18,SAM,What are you doin'?
12,18,DEAN,Leaving our mark. Here.
12,18,SAM,Hmm.
12,18,DEAN,"Guess we gotta call Mick, debrief or whatever."
12,18,SAM,Right.
12,18,Mr. Ketch,"Hello, Winchester."
12,18,DEAN,Ketch?
12,18,Sam,Where's Mick?
12,18,KETCH,"Oh, he didn't tell you?  He flew back to London last night.  After all the... Oh, unpleasantness with Dagon and Renny, well...Mick has a lot to answer for. So for the time being, you'll report to me."
12,18,DEAN,Seriously?
12,18,KETCH,"I don't like it any more than you do. I'd much rather be with your mother.  Hunting. For...Chupacabra in Texas.  But for now, I'm what you've got. So...Wisconsin?"
12,18,DEAN,We fought a god and won.
12,18,KETCH,Well done. We'll be in touch.
12,18,DEAN,So now we're reporting to low-rent Christian Bale? Seriously?  I don't like that guy. He creeps me out.
12,18,Sam,Yeah.
12,18,DEAN,"And he rides the oldest, worst, most unreliable bike."
12,21,TONI,I knew they had a way to set this trap. I didn't know that I'd be in it.
12,22,CUT TO,SAM and JODY in her sheriff truck. A guard dives out of the way. They smash through the front gate.
12,22,KETCH,"Hello, love."
12,23,DEAN,You won't.
13,1,JACK,Father?
13,1,SAM,"No, no no. No. I’m not your father, Jack. It is Jack, right?"
13,1,DEAN,Sam? Sammy?
13,1,SAM,I’m in here.
13,1,SAM,No!
13,1,MARY,Get away from them.
13,1,LUCIFER,"Mary, right? Look, seriously, I just wanted to say thank for everything. I owe you, kid."
13,1,SAM,"Mom, mom, mom."
13,1,DEAN,Mom!
13,1,DEAN,"Wait, was that-"
13,1,SAM,Lucifer’s son.
13,1,DEAN,Can he teleport?
13,1,SAM,Huh?
13,1,DEAN,The kid. Does he have wings?
13,1,Sam,I don’t know.
13,1,KID,First batch is down.
13,1,CLARK,Dude. Check it.
13,1,KID,Check what?
13,1,CLARK,This! Can I interest you in a Cheesebutt? Or maybe a Salty Butt Combo? Or perhaps my favorite - the Buttshake.
13,1,KID,"Dave sees this, he’s going to fire you."
13,1,CLARK,"Oh, come on. He’s fired me, like, seven times. And I keep coming back. You know why?"
13,1,KID,"Uh, because Dave’s banging your mom?"
13,1,CLARK,"Exactly. Let’s face it, buddy. Around here, I’m untouchable."
13,1,KID,Cool. Good for you.
13,1,JACK,Father?
13,1,JACK,Father.
13,1,CLARK,Whoa.
13,1,KID,I think you should call your mom.
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,Hi baby. (A pause) How naked?
13,1,DEAN,"We still have holy oil, right?"
13,1,SAM,For what?
13,1,DEAN,Cause we’re gonna have to hit him with everything we got
13,1,SAM,Hold on a second. Can we just talk about what happened back there?
13,1,SAM,"Yeah, because you tried to shoot him."
13,1,DEAN,"I tried to shoot the monster, Sam. It’s kind of what we do."
13,1,SAM,"We don’t know what he is yet, Dean. And I had it under control."
13,1,DEAN,I’m sorry. Are you defending the Son of Satan?
13,1,SAM,"I’m not defending anything. I’m just saying, look, with everything that’s happened, I’m obviously spun out also, but we need a plan."
13,1,DEAN,"Yeah, kill him! Okay? That’s the plan. Look, right now all that matters is finding him, and ending him, before he hurts anybody else. And once we do that we’ll figure everything else out."
13,1,SAM,What about Cas? Is he - is he really dead?
13,1,DEAN,You know he is.
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,Hi.
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,"Easy, easy now. I’m just...my name’s Christine Barker. I’m a sheriff. I’m just here to help, okay? Okay?"
13,1,2ND ANGEL,Is that -
13,1,1ST ANGEL,Castiel. Always knew he’d meet a bad end.
13,1,2ND ANGEL,He deserved better.
13,1,1ST ANGEL,"No, he really didn’t."
13,1,2ND ANGEL,"The mother’s upstairs, but she-"
13,1,1ST ANGEL,Of course he is.
13,1,EARL,So weird.
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,"Why don’t you head out on patrol, Earl? And by the way, there’s no such thing as “weird.” Everyone’s normal in their own way."
13,1,EARL,"Right. Sorry, Sheriff."
13,1,CLARK,Totally normal.
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,Hope those are all right. Just pulled some stuff from the lost and found. Everything fit? Here.
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,Take a seat. Sit.
13,1,SHERIFF,"Okay, let’s start with the basics. What’s your name?"
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,(more forcefully) What’s your name?
13,1,JACK,Jack.
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,"Okay Jack, Jack what? What’s your last name?"
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,"Okay, how about where are your parents? Your mother and father?"
13,1,JACK,"My mother, she’s in heaven. My father, he was supposed to be here, but he’s not. I’m trying to find him. I have to find him."
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,"Sure, we can do that. What’s his phone number?"
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,"What about his address, or an email?"
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,"Is there anything you do remember, Jack?"
13,1,JACK,I remember when the bad woman burned. I remember the universe screamed.
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,"Okay, I’m gonna take your thumbprint, and we’re gonna run it through the system. If we get a match we get you home, yeah?"
13,1,CLARK,"Dude, how high are you?"
13,1,JACK,I..don’t know what that means.
13,1,CLARK,"It means, um, wasted? Lit? Chonged, blitzed, blasted, blazed, baked? Nothing? No? Look, I’m not judging you. I’m jealous! What are you on?"
13,1,JACK,"I’m on a chair, on the floor, on the planet earth."
13,1,CLARK,"You are so stone, man."
13,1,JACK,"No, I’m not stoned. I’m…"
13,1,CLARK,What?
13,1,JACK,Hungry. I’m hungry.
13,1,DEAN,"Well. You really think that Lucifer Junior is at Pirate Pete’s Jolly Treats? That he was like what, “before I destroy the world, let me just grab a bag of curly fries”?"
13,1,SAM,"Look, if he would’ve kept to the main road, he would have walked past it. And I don’t know -"
13,1,DEAN,"Fine, just make it quick."
13,1,SAM,You’re not coming?
13,1,DEAN,"No. Look, maybe you’re right. Maybe the Devil’s kid is in there just hanging out. Or maybe he’s halfway across the country, torching Chicago. I’m gonna call Jody, check in, see if she can’t help us put a nationwide APB out on the creepy satanic nudist."
13,1,SAM,Good.
13,1,DEAN,Good is not the word I would use.
13,1,DRUNK WOMAN,Friiiies.
13,1,KID,"Lady, seriously. We don’t have fries. It’s breakfast only until eleven. But like I’ve said three times already, hash browns are basically the same."
13,1,DRUNK WOMAN,Boooo. Fries.
13,1,KID,Welcome to Pirate Pete’s Jolly Treats. ARGH. How can I help you?
13,1,DRUNK WOMAN,He wants fries. We all want fries.
13,1,KID,Shut up!
13,1,KID,Ignore her. She’s drunk off her ass.
13,1,DRUNK WOMAN,Little bit.
13,1,SAM,"Right. Uh, Okay, I’m looking for a guy. Uh, he - he’s about your height. Uh...naked."
13,1,KID,What did I say?
13,1,DRUNK WOMAN,Sorry.
13,1,KID,"And yeah, I saw him."
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,North Cove Sheriff’s Department. Barker speaking.
13,1,SAM,"This is Agent Berry. I’m with the FBI. Uh, I’m - I’m calling because, uh, did you happen to pick up a - a kid earlier today, uh, not exactly dressed. Um, he -"
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,"Uh, yeah. He’s here at the station."
13,1,SAM,"He is? Great, great, that’s great. Uh, okay, hold on to him. Don’t release him until I get there, all right?"
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,Holy…
13,1,SAM,Sheriff? Something wrong?
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,Uh... that’s something we should talk about in person.
13,1,DRUNK WOMAN,Whoa. What happened to you hand?
13,1,DEAN,Nothin’.
13,1,DRUNK WOMAN,"Doesn’t look like nothing. You punch a wall or something? I punched a wall once. Well, a poster on a wall, but same diff, right? Freshman year, I had this roommate, Becky. She had this giant poster of Elsa. You know, from “Frozen”? And I mean, first, who brings something like that to college? A cartoon? Really? Like, “hello homeschool,” right?"
13,1,DEAN,You done?
13,1,DRUNK WOMAN,"Anyway, Becky was - and I say this in the most feminist, screw the patriarchy way - a giant superbitch. She’d take things, and break things, and piss people off, and just do whatever she wanted, no matter who it hurt."
13,1,DRUNK WOMAN,"It’s like the whole world was just Becky to her, you know?"
13,1,DEAN,Mmm. So you punched her poster.
13,1,DRUNK WOMAN,And lit most of her stuff on fire.
13,1,DRUNK WOMAN,I got issues.
13,1,SAM,"Hey, s-"
13,1,SAM,"Dude, what’d you do to your hand?"
13,1,DRUNK WOMAN,Don’t ask. He’s super sensitive.
13,1,DEAN,You got anything?
13,1,SAM,"Yeah, I - I know where he is."
13,1,DEAN,Good. Great. Let’s go.
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,Clark? Jack?
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,Clark. CLARK!
13,1,CLARK,Mm. Hey mom.
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,"Uh, are you okay?"
13,1,CLARK,"Yeah, Jack was just hungry. I don’t think he’s ever had candy before."
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,Mmm.
13,1,JACK,I like it. I like nougat.
13,1,CLARK,He really does.
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,Did you see... there’s something wrong with the lights.
13,1,CLARK,"It’s, uh…"
13,1,CLARK,"...it’s crazy. Show her, the, mm, thing."
13,1,CLARK,"Mmm, yeah, dude’s uh... magic."
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,"Jack, how did you do that?"
13,1,JACK (chuckling),I don’t know.
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,Jack? Are you okay?
13,1,"JACK, groaning",I-- I don’t... I-- I have to…
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,Just wait. Wait.
13,1,CLARK,Mom!
13,1,DEAN,Nice shot.
13,1,SHERIFF BARKER,Don’t...what the hell is going on here?
13,3,DEAN,Sam's living in a dream world.
13,11,DOUG,"Aw, jeeze."
13,16,DEAN,Aah!
13,16,DEAN,Holy oil!
13,16,SAM,Oh!
13,16,DEAN,Whoa.
13,16,SAM,"Yeah. Yes. Uh, sorry about the mess."
13,16,SHOP OWNER,You boys just took down an evil plushie that was trying to kill me. We're all good.
13,16,MAN,Alan? Everything okay in here?
13,16,JAY,"I heard the ruckus next door, and I... What in the...What... holy heck?"
13,16,SAM,It -- it was a-a...
13,16,JAY,Did they do this?
13,16,SAM,"No. Naw, it was a... Defective product. Yeah, sometimes the batteries in these...giant stuffed dinosaurs just explode."
13,16,DEAN (chuckling),"Yeah, never buy anything from Mooselyvania."
13,16,SAM,Mm. Exactly.
13,16,DEAN,Mm.
13,16,JAY (skeptically),Okay.
13,16,ALAN,"Uh, guys, this is Jay. He's the big man around this neighborhood. Owns practically the whole damn thing -- the Chinese joint, the laundromat."
13,16,SAM,"Great. Great, great, great. Yeah, that's very cool. Can you guys give us a second?"
13,16,ALAN,Great.
13,16,SAM,"What the hell was that? I mean, we rolled into town because people were seeing a lizard monster. And yes, we tracked it back here, but no way did I think we'd end up --"
13,16,DEAN,Killing Barney?
13,16,SAM,Yeah.
13,16,DEAN (grinning),"Was pretty satisfying, though, wasn't it? Probably just a cursed object."
13,16,SAM,"Well, it didn't act like a cursed object. We should probably do some digging."
13,16,JAY,Everything all right?
13,16,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, great."
13,16,SAM,"Yeah. Uh, we were just gonna head out."
13,16,ALAN,"Oh, hold up. You boys saved my life."
13,16,SAM,We could never. We're -- we're just happy we could help.
13,16,DEAN,Wait. Uh...anything?
13,16,SAM,"Dean, this is ridiculous."
13,16,DEAN,"Look, giving us this made him feel good, okay?"
13,16,SAM,"Yeah, where are you gonna put this? You..."
13,16,DEAN,I'm the good guy.
13,16,SAM,What?
13,16,DEAN,She's delicate!
13,16,SAM,She...Pfft.
13,16,DEAN,Go that way. I'll lead.
13,16,SAM,W-what?
13,16,SAM,Yeah. Dean...
13,16,DEAN,Shh.
13,16,SAM,"Dude, watch out."
13,16,DEAN,"Hey, what are you doin'?"
13,16,SAM,"Uh, research."
13,16,DEAN,Okay.
13,16,SAM,"You know, it's the strangest thing. I-I can't find anything on a-a cursed object that actually physically attacks people."
13,16,DEAN,"Dude, it's over. All right? Be like Elsa -- Let it go."
13,16,SAM,"""Be like Elsa""?"
13,16,DEAN (nodding),Ah? Right? Come here. I need to show you something. It's important. Come on.
13,16,DEAN,Behold (Dean turns on the light) ... the Dean-cave. Or Fortress of Dean-a-tude. Just -- still trying to figure that one out.
13,16,DEAN,"We got Foosball. We've got jukebox -- all vinyl, obviously. Double La-Z-Boy recliners. And, of course, the bar. Still a work-in-progress. It's gonna have a kegerator because...Well, it's gonna. And finally... the pièce de résistance."
13,16,SAM,"Okay, hold on, hold on. When did you have time to do all this?"
13,16,DEAN,"When it's important, you make time, Sammy."
13,16,SAM,Wh--
13,16,DEAN,"Let's give this bad boy a test run, huh?"
13,16,SAM,What the hell?
13,16,SAM,"Uh, is -- is this...Okay, okay, okay. This is dream. It's gotta be a --"
13,16,SAM,Dude!
13,16,DEAN,It's not a dream. Holy crap.
13,16,SAM,"This is, uh... You saw that light. Did we just get sucked into the TV?"
13,16,DEAN,Or maybe this is an angel thing. Or -- or the Trickster.
13,16,SAM,"No, he's dead."
13,16,DEAN,Or is he?
13,16,SAM,"Dean, what the hell?"
13,16,DEAN,"I don't know, Sam. I..."
13,16,DEAN,Whoa.
13,16,SAM,Uh...How did the car get here?
13,16,DEAN,"I had the keys in my pocket? Or maybe -- Wait, seriously? That's what's bumping you about this? Okay, look, are we animated? Yes. Is it weird? Yes."
13,16,SAM,It's beyond weird.
13,16,DEAN,"Well, and ""beyond weird"" is kind of our thing. So whatever happened, we'll figure it out. This is a case, so let's work it."
13,16,SAM,How?
13,16,DEAN,Same as always. We drive.
13,16,SAM,A malt shop. Really?
13,16,DEAN,"Look, let's just head in, ask around, see what we can see."
13,16,DEAN,"Oh, my God."
13,16,DEAN (excitedly),That's the Mystery Machine. We're not just in any cartoon.
13,16,SAM,We're in Scooby-Doo!
13,16,DEAN,Oh! That's the freakin' Scooby Gang!
13,16,SAM,Great. So we're stuck in a cartoon with a talking dog.
13,16,DAPHNE,Jeepers! Those sure were some super groovy tunes.
13,16,DEAN,"Oh, man. This is like a dream come true."
13,16,SAM,Your dream is to hang out with the Scooby Gang?
13,16,DEAN,"Sam, growing up on the road, no matter where Dad dragged us, no matter what we did, there was always a TV. And you know what was always on that TV? Scooby and the Gang. These guys, they're our friggin' role models, man. Except Fred. He's a wad."
13,16,SAM,He's...What?
13,16,DEAN,"Just think about it -- we do the same thing. We go to spooky places, we solve mysteries, we fight ghosts."
13,16,SAM,"Yeah, except our ghosts don't wear masks, and we don't have a talking dog."
13,16,DEAN,"I don't know. I mean, Cass is kind of like a talking dog. Now, how do I look?"
13,16,SAM,Two-dimensional.
13,16,DEAN,Perfect!
13,16,DEAN,Uh...hi.
13,16,FRED,Huh?
13,16,DEAN,"Uh, uh, I'm Dean. My brother, Sam. Mind if we join you?"
13,16,FRED,"Of course not! There's plenty of room. I'm Fred. This is Velma, Shaggy, Scooby, and --"
13,16,DEAN,Daphne.
13,16,DAPHNE,Hmm?
13,16,DEAN,Enchanté.
13,16,DAPHNE,Hmm.
13,16,DEAN,"Of course, we know you. You guys are famous."
13,16,SCOOBY,Famous?
13,16,SHAGGY,"Like, the only thing we're famous for is our eating skills."
13,16,SCOOBY,"Yum, yum, yum."
13,16,DEAN,"So, looks like you guys are celebrating something?"
13,16,VELMA,We are!
13,16,DAPHNE,Scooby saved him from drowning in a fish pond.
13,16,SCOOBY,I'm a hero.
13,16,SHAGGY,Scooby.
13,16,SAM,"Okay, okay, but he's dead now, right?"
13,16,FRED,"(hesitantly) Uh, yeah. Uh, cancer."
13,16,DEAN,Give us a second.
13,16,DEAN,"Hey, you wanna pull that stick out of your...nether regions and just play along here?"
13,16,SAM,"Play...There are no words in this newspaper, Dean. We should be trying to get out of here and instead, you-you're hanging out with Marmaduke."
13,16,DEAN,How dare you!
13,16,SAM,"And hitting on Daphne, when she's clearly with Fred."
13,16,DEAN,"She's settling, all right? Oh, Daphne could do so much better. Last time we got zapped into TV, we got out by playing our part. This is probably like that. The gang, they're about to get a mystery."
13,16,FRED,"I don't know, gang. Sounds like this could be the start of a mystery."
13,16,FRED,"That sounds like a swell idea. In fact, I think it's high time we hit the road."
13,16,SHAGGY,You know what that means?
13,16,SCOOBY,Uh-huh!
13,16,DEAN,"Oh, heck, yes!"
13,16,FRED,"Hey, why don't you guys follow us up to the Colonel's mansion?"
13,16,DEAN,"I don't know, Freddie. I'm not sure Baby can go that slow."
13,16,FRED,"Well, the Mystery Machine is a lot faster than it looks."
13,16,DEAN,"Oh, yeah? Well, let's see who can get there first. Or are you...chicken?"
13,16,FRED,"Well, I'm game if you are."
13,16,SAM,"Hey, why do you hate Fred so much?"
13,16,DEAN,"He thinks he's so cool, with his perfect hair, his can-do attitude, that stupid ascot. Let's do this!"
13,16,SAM,Did... did you just get beat by a microvan?
13,16,DEAN,The light was red! The light...
13,16,DEAN,"Look, all I'm saying is that, aerodynamically speaking, there is no way my Baby should lose to...that (pointing to the Mystery Machine). Unless Fred cheated, which he clearly did."
13,16,SAM,"Dude, get over it."
13,16,DEAN,No!
13,16,DEAN,"""A Night of Fright is No Delight."""
13,16,SAM,What?
13,16,DEAN,"That's the episode we're in. I've seen it, like, a million times."
13,16,MAN,"Attention, everybody. As you all know, I am Cosgood Creeps, attorney of the late Colonel Sanders."
13,16,DEAN,Shut up.
13,16,COSGOOD CREEPS,My client was a bit odd. His only directions were to play this record for you.
13,16,DEAN,Yeah! Classic vinyl.
13,16,SAM,Haunted?
13,16,SCOOBY,Haunted?
13,16,SCOOBY,"Oh, boy."
13,16,SAM,"What kind of a weirdo sets all this up? I mean, spend the night in a haunted house for $1 million? That can't be legal."
13,16,VELMA,"Sam, come on. The house isn't really haunted."
13,16,SAM,I'm not --
13,16,VELMA,And things like this happen all the time.
13,16,SAM,"Oh, yeah, maybe in a car--"
13,16,SAM,"Dude, what's wrong with you?"
13,16,DEAN,"They don't know that they're in a...a C-word. And we're not gonna tell 'em about anything.
Not where we're from, not about monsters. Nothing. Capiche?"
13,16,DEAN,"They are pure and innocent and good, and we're gonna keep it that way."
13,16,SAM,"Look, if you've seen this episode, why-why can't we just skip to the end?"
13,16,DEAN,"Well, 'cause sometimes it's about the journey and not the destination."
13,16,SAM,Or do you just want more time to try and get with Daphne?
13,16,DEAN,Do not ruin this for me!
13,16,COSGOOD,"I'll return to the house in the morning to find out which of you remain, if any. (laughs maniacally)"
13,16,DEAN,"Turns out, he's the bad guy."
13,16,SAM,You don't say.
13,16,COUSIN SIMPLE,Ten o'clock and I suggest we all turn in.
13,16,DEAN,"So, Daphne... old drafty house."
13,16,DEAN,What say you and I bunk together?
13,16,DAPHNE (giggling),"Oh, Dean! Boys and girls don't sleep in the same room, silly."
13,16,DEAN,Awesome.
13,16,FRED,"Relax, Scooby. We'll spend the night with ya."
13,16,SAM,Are you wearing...a nightgown?
13,16,DEAN,"It's called a sleeping robe. Between you and me, it's freakin' comfortable. It's like I'm wrapped in hugs."
13,16,DAPHNE,So those new guys are kinda groovy.
13,16,VELMA,"Sure, Dean's all right. But that big lug...What a dummy. ""Haunted."" Sheesh. Like that's a real thing."
13,16,DAPHNE,Huh.
13,16,VELMA,What?
13,16,DAPHNE,"Oh, nothing. Just...I thought big lugs were kinda your thing."
13,16,VELMA,Huh? (blushing) Pssh.
13,16,COUSIN SIMPLE,Hmm? Huh?
13,16,SAM,Is that all you're gonna do? Eat?
13,16,DEAN,"Relax. In a few minutes, we're gonna find out that Cousin Simple's missing, the Scooby's are gonna think that it's a ghost, but really, it's just the lawyer Cosgood Creeps in disguise."
13,16,DEAN,Told ya.
13,16,FRED,"Come on, gang! Let's check it out!"
13,16,DAPHNE,"Oh, no!"
13,16,DEAN,"Wait, wait, wait. No, the dummy bodies don't show up until later."
13,16,SAM,"Dean, this isn't a dummy. This is blood."
13,16,SAM,"He's -- he's dead. Like -- like, really, actually dead."
13,16,VELMA,Jinkies!
13,16,DAPHNE,Jeepers!
13,16,SHAGGY,Zoinks!
13,16,SCOOBY,Ruh-roh!
13,16,DEAN,Son of a bitch.
13,16,FRED (happily),"Well, gang, it looks like we've got another mystery on our hands."
13,16,SAM,"Are you kidding me, Fred? Dude, someone's dead. A little respect."
13,16,DEAN,"Yeah, Fred. He can be such a jerk. (Leaning into Daphne) Right, Daphne?"
13,16,DAPHNE,Not really.
13,16,SCOOBY,Huh?!
13,16,VELMA,Like fingerprints or fluids.
13,16,SCOOBY,Uh-huh!
13,16,SAM,Fluids?
13,16,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, okay. Um, so, if that guy can die for real in this cartoon, that means we can, too."
13,16,DEAN,"It doesn't matter if we die. Scooby-Doo could die! And that's not happening, not on my watch. I'd take a bullet for that dog."
13,16,VELMA,There has to be a logical explanation for what's going on.
13,16,SHAGGY,Besides a ghost hunting us down to collect an inheritance?
13,16,SCOOBY,"Yeah, what he said."
13,16,DAPHNE,What would a ghost need with money?
13,16,VELMA,"Precisely. And besides, there's no such thing as ghosts."
13,16,SCOOBY,Huh?
13,16,VELMA,"So once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth."
13,16,SHAGGY,Look!
13,16,FRED,Gotcha!
13,16,MAN,Uhh! Aah! Uhh!
13,16,DEAN,"Not today, freak!"
13,16,SAM,Cass?
13,16,DEAN,Cass?
13,16,SHAGGY,"Like, you know this guy?"
13,16,SAM,"Uh, yeah, yeah. He's a -- he's a friend of ours."
13,16,DAPHNE,Neato!
13,16,DEAN,"Castiel, the Scooby Gang."
13,16,SHAGGY,Castiel? It sounds like a great Italian pizza place.
13,16,CASTIEL,"Uh, it's a pleasure to meet you."
13,16,SCOOBY,"Nice to meet you, too."
13,16,CASTIEL,"Sam, Dean...this dog is talking."
13,16,DEAN,Yep.
13,16,SAM,"Cass, how did you get here?"
13,16,CASTIEL,"Well, I was looking for you at the bunker when..."
13,16,CASTIEL,Sam? Dean? I'm back from Syria with fruit from the Tree of Life. The tree was guarded by a pack of djinn.
13,16,CASTIEL,Dean?
13,16,CASTIEL,"I saw purple sparks, then a flash of light, and the next thing I knew, I was in this strange world.  I saw you race off..."
13,16,SAM,"You saw purple sparks? Dean, that's like with the killer stuffed dinosaur. And they were both in that pawn shop. Maybe this is all connected."
13,16,VELMA,"Um, ""killer stuffed dinosaur""?"
13,16,SAM,"Oh, I-I didn't mean a real..."
13,16,DEAN,"It's a book we're writing. Yeah, about...killer stuffed dinosaurs. It's called..."
13,16,CASTIEL,"""The Killer Stuffed Dinosaur in Love."""
13,16,FRED,Huh. Great title.
13,16,SCOOBY,Yeah. Great title.
13,16,DAPHNE,"Well, if he isn't responsible for Cousin Simple's death, who is?"
13,16,SCOOBY,Huh?
13,16,SHAGGY,"Like, somebody turn up the heat in here, man. It's getting cold."
13,16,SCOOBY,Huh?
13,16,SHAGGY,Huh?
13,16,DEAN,Sam.
13,16,SCOOBY,Roh!
13,16,SHAGGY,Ph-ph-ph-phantom!
13,16,SCOOBY,Aah!
13,16,DEAN,"Come on, Sam. We're on."
13,16,FRED,Yah!
13,16,FRED,Uhh!
13,16,FRED,Gotcha!
13,16,FRED,Uhh! Huh?
13,16,DEAN,"Wait, what?"
13,16,SCOOBY,G-g-g-g-ghost!
13,16,VELMA,"Guys, no. It's not a ghost."
13,16,SHAGGY,"Oh, yeah? Then, man, how did he just walk through that wall?!"
13,16,VELMA,"Well, there's probably a hidden door."
13,16,FRED,"Well, whatever it was, it's gone now. It looks like he was coming out of here."
13,16,FRED,"Well, that's not good."
13,16,DEAN,I think I'm gonna be sick.
13,16,FRED,"Come on, gang!"
13,16,SAM,So do they always just walk away from dead bodies or...
13,16,DEAN,"Sam, the cold spot, fritzing out...that was a ghost -- our kind of ghost. I think this cartoon is haunted."
13,16,DEAN,"All right, Prepmeister Fred, what's your plan?"
13,16,FRED,We should all split up and search the house for clues.
13,16,CASTIEL,That's a plan?
13,16,DEAN (disapprovingly),Mnh-mnh.
13,16,SAM,I-I don't think we should separate. It'll be easier for Dean and me to keep you safe if we're all together.
13,16,VELMA,"Really, Sam? I wouldn't expect such a big, broad-shouldered fella like you to be as chicken as Shaggy."
13,16,VELMA,"No offense, Shaggy."
13,16,SAM,"If this is a real ghost, these guys are in trouble. We can't let anything happen to them."
13,16,DEAN,"Exactly. So, for now, let's follow ascot boy's lead. (running to Daphne) I call team-up with Daphne!"
13,16,FRED,Great! It'll be just the three of us.
13,16,VELMA,Sam and I will check the attic. I mean...unless you're too scared.
13,16,SAM,"What? N-no, I-I'm...Let's check the attic."
13,16,SHAGGY,"Like, man, I guess that leaves me and old Scoob with you, Castiel."
13,16,CASTIEL,"Wonderful. I once led armies, and now I'm paired with a scruffy Philistine and a talking dog."
13,16,VELMA,"So I guess this is your first mystery. So if you could keep those giant linebacker shoulders from knocking over any clues, that would be great."
13,16,SAM,Why do you keep talking about my shoulders?
13,16,VELMA,"Oh, I, uh, huh.
Uh..."
13,16,SAM,Aah!
13,16,VELMA,Maybe that was the ghost.
13,16,SAM,"Look, I'm not supposed to tell you this, but ghosts are real."
13,16,VELMA,Huh?
13,16,SAM,"My brother and I, we hunt them, along with werewolves and vampires and demons and...We've saved the world. A lot."
13,16,VELMA (laughing),"Look, Sam, the simple fact is monsters are nothing more than crooks in masks -- usually unscrupulous real estate developers."
13,16,SAM,"One, there are way better real estate scams. And two --"
13,16,VELMA,"Hey, look! A clue."
13,16,VELMA,That's strange.
13,16,SAM,That's strange.
13,16,VELMA,I guess we both noticed that these toys are the only things up here that aren't covered in dust.
13,16,SAM,"Actually, I was noticing this. (running his fingers through the goo) Ectoplasm. This gets left behind by ghosts."
13,16,VELMA,"Oh, stop already. You can't really believe in ghosts."
13,16,VELMA,Oh!
13,16,SAM,Oh!
13,16,SAM,Told you.
13,16,VELMA,Aah! It's not a g-- It's probably just Christmas lights and -- and fishing line.
13,16,DEAN,"So, Daph, I usually don't have to do this, but what do you look for in a guy?"
13,16,DAPHNE,"Oh, I don't know. Strong, sincere, and an ascot wouldn't hurt."
13,16,DEAN,"Whoa, hold on. Check out that book."
13,16,FRED,"There are a lot of books in here, Dean."
13,16,DEAN,"No, that one. The one that isn't painted into the background of the car--Library. The...library."
13,16,DEAN,Huh. Sorry. I thought it might be some kind of secret passage or...
13,16,ALL,Aah!
13,16,DEAN,"Whoa! Daphne, you okay? Maybe I should just give you a once-over to make sure."
13,16,DEAN,"AHH! Oh! Oh, hell no."
13,16,SHAGGY,"Like, did someone open a window?"
13,16,SCOBBY,"Yeah, it's cold in here."
13,16,CASTIEL,Never seen a ghost wear such a ridiculous costume.
13,16,CASTIEL,Huh?
13,16,SHAGGY,Aah!
13,16,DEAN,Hey!
13,16,FRED,We have to stop this ghost.
13,16,DAPHNE,We almost did. Dean had him by the thigh.
13,16,CASTIEL,He what?
13,16,DEAN,I almost caught him. That's the point.
13,16,VELMA,"Guys, come on. For the last time, there's no such thing as ghosts."
13,16,VELMA,"Oh, no!"
13,16,VELMA,That costume looks really...real.
13,16,FRED,I'll get him.
13,16,SAM,"Fred, don't!"
13,16,FRED,Uhh!
13,16,DAPHNE,Fred!
13,16,DAPHNE,Huh?
13,16,VELMA,Huh?
13,16,DAPHNE,Oh!
13,16,SHAGGY,"Like, that's our cue to get out of here! Aah! Run!"
13,16,SHAGGY,Aah!
13,16,DAPHNE,Shaggy!
13,16,SAM,Dean! Iron!
13,16,DAPHNE,Oh!
13,16,VELMA,Oh!
13,16,BOTH,Ah!
13,16,FRED,What just happened?
13,16,SCOOBY,Where's Shaggy?
13,16,SHAGGY,Over here!
13,16,SHAGGY,"Like, little help?"
13,16,SCOOBY,Shaggy!
13,16,CASTIEL,Scooby!
13,16,DEAN,Scooby!
13,16,SCOOBY,Gotcha!
13,16,SHAGGY,You've got me! Who's got you?!
13,16,SCOOBY,Oh!
13,16,SHAGGY,Aah!
13,16,SCOOBY,Shaggy!
13,16,DAPHNE,Shaggy! Are you okay?
13,16,SHAGGY,"Like, do I look like I'm okay?"
13,16,CASTIEL,It appears his arm is broken.
13,16,SHAGGY,What? That's not -- I have jumped out of a biplane in a museum and was fine! How did this happen?!
13,16,FRED,I-I don't know. I...Something threw me across the room.
13,16,VELMA,Wires. Probably just wires.
13,16,SHAGGY,"Like, hello! Broken arm here!"
13,16,VELMA,"Shaggy, brace yourself."
13,16,DAPHNE,"Uhh! Fred, give me your ascot."
13,16,SAM,"Dean, we have to tell them the truth."
13,16,DAPHNE,What truth?
13,16,SAM,The truth about the phantom.
13,16,DEAN,"Look, this phantom isn't like other ghosts you've faced. He's real. He is a real ghost."
13,16,SCOOBY GANG,Huh?
13,16,FRED,"Um, I'm not totally following you."
13,16,SAM,"Look, that isn't a guy in a mask and a costume. It's a vengeful spirit that's come back from the dead."
13,16,DEAN,That's the truth.
13,16,SAM,Mm-hmm.
13,16,VELMA,Werewolves? Vampires? Demons?
13,16,VELMA,"I thought I was blind without my glasses, but I was just blind. Oh, how could I be so stupid?"
13,16,SAM,"Uh, well, I mean..."
13,16,FRED,We've been stopping real estate developers when we could've been hunting Dracula?
13,16,FRED,Are you kidding me?!
13,16,FRED,My life is meaningless!
13,16,DAPHNE,If there are ghosts... that means there's an afterlife. Heaven. Hell. Am I going to hell?!
13,16,SHAGGY,We told you every freaking time! But did you ever listen to Scoob and me? No!
13,16,SCOOBY,We're doomed.
13,16,DEAN (sternly),"All right, knock it off! Come on! Scooby Gang does not have nervous breakdowns. Now you may not have tangled with the supernatural, but you've fought monsters, real freakin' psychos. Well, you stopped Zeke and Zeb. Shaggy figured out that the sharks Old Iron Face rode were really just torpedoes disguised to look like sharks. And what about the Black Knight? Huh? Mamba Wamba?"
13,16,SAM,The Space Kook.
13,16,DEAN,"I knew it! You love this show, too."
13,16,SAM (shrugging),Mm.
13,16,DEAN,"Space Kook, Ghost Clown, Miner 49er. You guys have all jumped into danger with no thought for yourselves. You're heroes, and together, we're gonna take down this phantom. Are you with me?"
13,16,FRED,Let's do it!
13,16,VELMA,But how? We don't know the first thing about fighting real ghosts. We don't have the proper tools or weapons.
13,16,SAM,That's okay. We do.
13,16,SCOOBY GANG,Ooh. Whoa.
13,16,SAM,"Here, Velma, take this."
13,16,DEAN,"Sam, are you crazy? They can't use this stuff. That's a Scooby-don't."
13,16,FRED,"Dean, we've gotta do something. I mean, you guys are amazing!"
13,16,DEAN,"Thank you, Fred."
13,16,FRED,But we can help. We have to.
13,16,DEAN,(bleep) right you can. You're gonna do what you do best -- build a trap.
13,16,FRED,Ahh. That should do it.
13,16,DEAN,"Lay it on me, Freddy."
13,16,FRED,"Well, you see, Daphne's covered all the exits except that one with salt. So the phantom will enter there, tripping the iron chain that'll activate the ax, which cuts the rope that holds the coconuts."
13,16,SAM,Where'd he get coconuts?
13,16,DEAN,Shh!
13,16,FRED,"The coconuts are gonna roll, tripping the phantom, sending him careening down a slide of soap, right into the washing machine which we'll secure with those iron chains."
13,16,SAM,"And with the ghost captured, we can finally find out what's going on."
13,16,VELMA,Now all we need...is bait.
13,16,SHAGGY,You think the phantom decided to leave?
13,16,CASTIEL,"No, it's still here. Don't worry."
13,16,SCOOBY,That's what I'm worried about.
13,16,SCOOBY,Hmm. Mm-hmm?
13,16,CASTIEL,Aah! Run!
13,16,SCOOBY,Shaggy Whoa!
13,16,SAM,I told you it wasn't going to work.
13,16,DEAN,"Yeah, Fred's traps never work. (yelling) Daph, Plan B! Operation Bookworm is a go."
13,16,SHAGGY,"Good shot, Scoob old buddy."
13,16,SHAGGY,Give him another one.
13,16,DAPHNE,"Scooby, now!"
13,16,SAM,That's a salt circle. You're stuck.
13,16,GHOST,Let...me...go!
13,16,DEAN,"Happy to, Sparky, soon as you tell us who you really are."
13,16,CASTIEL,It's...a child.
13,16,DEAN,"Yeah, creepy ghost kid. You get used to 'em."
13,16,SAM,But...Wait. Why are you trying to kill us?
13,16,BOY,"I'm not. I never wanted to hurt anyone. But the bad man, he makes me."
13,16,CASTIEL,The bad man?
13,16,BOY,His name is Jay.
13,16,DEAN,The dude from the pawnshop.
13,16,BOY,"When I died, my soul was tied to a pocketknife."
13,16,BOY,"My dad gave it to me.  It meant everything. When Jay found me, he used me to...Sometimes, I get so angry I break things, hurt people."
13,16,BOY,But I don't want to.
13,16,BOY,I just wanna see my dad again.
13,16,CASTIEL,I'm sorry. It was wrong of him to do that.
13,16,SAM,None of this was your fault.
13,16,DEAN,"Look, if you get us back to the real world, we can set you free."
13,16,BOY,Do you promise?
13,16,DEAN,"Cross my heart and hope to d-- Well, you know what I mean."
13,16,FRED,Should I -- should I make another trap?
13,16,VELMA,I could get the shotgun!
13,16,DAPHNE,I could get two shotguns!
13,16,SHAGGY,"Like, tell Scoob and me when it's over!"
13,16,SCOOBY,Yeah!
13,16,DEAN,"Kid, we need a favor."
13,16,GANG,Aah! Uhh!
13,16,FRED,Did you send it back to the fiery pit from whence it came?!
13,16,SAM,"Look, everything's under control."
13,16,SCOOBY GANG,Aah! Kill it with fire!
13,16,DEAN,"Whoa! Slow your roll, guys. We were wrong."
13,16,GANG,Huh?
13,16,DAPHNE,What -- what are you -- what are you saying?
13,16,SAM,Velma...w-was right.
13,16,SHAGGY,"Like, she was?"
13,16,SAM,This wasn't a real ghost. We were fooled.
13,16,SAM,"But you never were, right, Velma?"
13,16,VELMA,"I, uh...I don't know."
13,16,DEAN,"Hey, guys, do your thing. This is my favorite part."
13,16,SCOOBY GANG,Cosgood Creeps?!
13,16,DAPHNE,But...the flying.
13,16,SAM,Wires.
13,16,FRED,Huh.
13,16,SHAGGY,What about the walking through the walls? And the bodies?
13,16,SAM,"Well, that was just a projector. As for the bodies..."
13,16,VELMA,Were they...dummies filled with corn syrup?
13,16,SCOOBY,Huh?
13,16,SAM,Exactly.
13,16,FRED,Of course! Cosgood was trying to drive everyone from the house so he could get the money for himself.
13,16,DEAN,Right. But the joke is on him because the money's worthless.
13,16,DEAN,It's all Confederate dollars.
13,16,SCOOBY,"Aw! Oh, well. Easy come easy go."
13,16,VELMA (laughing),"So... I was right. I told ya, ya big lug.
There's no such thing as the supernatural."
13,16,SAM,"Looks like you were right, and now we know."
13,16,FRED,This is great news! Let's meet at the malt shop and celebrate.
13,16,DEAN,"Sure, Fred. And hey, you're not so bad."
13,16,FRED,"Yeah, I know. Thanks."
13,16,DEAN,"(placing his hand on Daphne's waist) So, uh...I guess this is it."
13,16,DAPHNE,This is what?
13,16,SHAGGY,"Like, we will miss breathing."
13,16,SCOOBY,hh!Ohh!
13,16,CASTIEL,Thank you. You've shown me the great strength of laughter in the face of danger.
13,16,SCOOBY,"Danger?! Where?! Let's get out of here, man."
13,16,SAM,"Great working with you, Velma."
13,16,VELMA,"You, too, Sam."
13,16,VELMA,Mmm. Mwah. Those shoulders. Jinkies! (she raises her arms triumphantly as she leaves the room)
13,16,DEAN,Shoulda known Velma was good to go. Gah! It's always the quiet ones.
13,16,CASTIEL,We're ready.
13,16,SAM,Okay. That was...something.
13,16,DEAN,That was the coolest thing that's ever happened to me. And that includes the Cartwright twins.
13,16,CASTIEL,What did you do with the Cartwright twins?
13,16,DEAN (laughing),Oh. I'll be right back.
13,16,SAM,I don't think I wanna know.
13,16,DEAN,"Well, sorry, sweetheart."
13,16,DEAN,"Time to go, kid."
13,16,BOY,What about the bad man?
13,16,SAM,"Don't worry about him. We'll take care of him, all right?"
13,16,JAY,You sure about this?
13,16,ALAN,"Look, you're gettin' this place for a steal. But...I'm too old for this crap."
13,16,JAY,"If you say so. Just, uh, two more signatures, and..."
13,16,DEAN,Not so fast.
13,16,ALAN,Is that an ascot?
13,16,DEAN,"Yes. Yes, it is."
13,16,JAY,"Uh, what are you guys doing here?"
13,16,SAM,"Hey, Alan, your friend here, he's been driving people off their property so he could buy it on the cheap. And he's been using his own personal ghost to do it. You see, he'd plant the haunted object, then let the ghost go to work."
13,16,DEAN,"Then they would possess something, like a big dinosaur or a perfectly beautiful TV."
13,16,CASTIEL,And scare people so much that they'd be desperate to sell.
13,16,SAM,When we got nosy...
13,16,SAM,I think we should probably keep doing some digging.
13,16,JAY,Everything all right?
13,16,SAM,He sicced his pet ghost on us.
13,16,JAY,They're lying. They're... You think anyone's gonna believe that?
13,16,SAM,"No, but that's why we hacked your financials. Turns out you're not so big on paying your taxes, are ya?"
13,16,DEAN,"Good enough for Capone, good enough for you."
13,16,SAM,Ha! Velma was right. It was a shady real estate developer after all.
13,16,COP,Here you go.
13,16,DEAN (excitedly),He said it! He said the line!
13,16,COP,Watch your head.
13,16,SAM,What are you doing?
13,16,DEAN,"Well, I mean, at the end of every mystery, Scooby looks into the camera and he says --"
13,16,CASTIEL,"Dean, you're not a talking dog."
13,16,DEAN,I know that. I...
13,16,SAM,Yeah.
13,16,DEAN,"No, but come on, I-I do look cool with the ascot, right?"
13,18,KETCH,"Ah, well...here we are."
13,18,KETCH,"You do know where we are, don't you? Because, not to be a nag, but we've only got 24 hours before..."
13,18,DEAN,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just give me -- give me a minute."
13,18,KETCH,...the rift closes.
13,18,DEAN,"Look, we just got spin-cycled through space and time, okay? And yes, this is... different than my last drop-by. And what's this “we” crap, hmm? You came here to save yourself, so... go save yourself, somewhere else."
13,18,KETCH,"Well, actually, I thought I could help."
13,18,DEAN,What?
13,18,KETCH,Find the boy. And your...mother. She's in danger. I owe her that.
13,18,DEAN,"You know, she sees you, she'll probably kill you. Again."
13,18,KETCH,"Perhaps, but you don't know where you are or what's out there or even... You get the picture. Would having a little bit of backup really be so bad?"
13,18,KETCH,"Well, this is quite the vacation spot, isn't it?"
13,18,DEAN,"Yeah. If you had your heart set on Mai Tais, well...sorry."
13,18,COMMANDER,Is this everyone?
13,18,SOLDIER,"Yes, Commander."
13,18,COMMANDER,"For high crimes of fomenting rebellion against the archangel Michael, these humans shall be executed."
13,18,DEAN,Freakin' angels.
13,18,KETCH,Not smart.
13,18,COMMANDER,Wait.
13,18,DEAN,Charlie?
13,18,COMMANDER,I know you. You're not the usual human scum.
13,18,COMMANDER,"You're with the Resistance. Inner circle. She's met with the Nephilim and the other-worlder, Mary. Michael will want her at the Northern Camp, for interrogation."
13,18,AW CHARLIE,"Champ, when the Resistance crushes you, I'm gonna be there to shred your feathers and grind them into dust."
13,18,KETCH,Dean...
13,18,CASTIEL,"Dean is in Apocalypse World, alone?"
13,18,SAM,"No, he's with Ketch, so he's not alone."
13,18,CASTIEL,Because that makes it so much better.
13,18,SAM,"Cass, he wanted to go solo."
13,18,CASTIEL,And you let him?
13,18,SAM,"I... He didn't give me much of a choice. Anyways, Dean's right. As long as he's over there, and we're here, we need to be taking care of Gabriel, getting him right again."
13,18,SAM,Gabriel?
13,18,CASTIEL,You didn't tell me it was this bad.
13,18,SAM,"Yeah, well, years of isolation and torture and Asmodeus draining his grace. Come here. Help me out."
13,18,SAM,"Hey, Gabriel. Hey, pal."
13,18,SAM,"Mm! Okay. Oh -- Just... Gonna get ya to bed, all right? Let me, uh, help you up. It's okay. It's okay."
13,18,SAM,"It's okay. Gabriel, it's Sam Winchester. Do you remember me?"
13,18,CASTIEL,I don't think he does.
13,18,SAM,Remember the video you sent to my brother Dean Winchester and me after you...supposedly died? You told us how to stuff Lucifer back in the Cage.
13,18,CASTIEL,"Sam, he doesn't..."
13,18,SAM,"I know he doesn't. I'm just... trying to see if anything's going on in his head. All right, well..."
13,18,SAM,"Gabriel's grace. Ketch brought it. Maybe if he's juiced up, it'll help."
13,18,SAM,All right.
13,18,CASTIEL,"Sam, I don't think he's gonna open up and let the choo-choo in."
13,18,CASTIEL,A technique for feeding recalcitrant children. And... I think a little coercion may be necessary.
13,18,SAM,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa!"
13,18,GABRIEL [whimpering],Aah! Aah! Aah!
13,18,LUCIFER,Where've you been?
13,18,SISTER JO,Out.
13,18,LUCIFER,"Right. Out. Look, Jo, uh, you got a pretty sweet deal going here, so you might wanna... I don't know, pitch in, drop the attitude, stay by my side. Play strip poker?"
13,18,SISTER JO,"Shouldn't you be out doing...kingly things? Commanding the angels, inspiring mankind? Stuff?"
13,18,SISTER JO,"We came here to change things, make Heaven better, help the angels..."
13,18,LUCIFER,"Dumah. Perfect timing. Okay, I have a question for you, and I want you to be straight with me. Okay? Don't you think Jo should show a little bit more enthusiasm for being... for want of a better word, First Lady? Pull her weight? Little bit? Keep me happy? Little bit?"
13,18,DUMAH,Couples issues aren't my area.
13,18,LUCIFER,"So that's a ""yes."" Okay? So, you're here with breaking news about my son. Go."
13,18,DUMAH,"The few angels that we could spare are scanning the planet, but so far, nothing."
13,18,LUCIFER,"Yeah, well, he's a priority, so..."
13,18,DUMAH,We don't have the manpower.
13,18,DUMAH,Of course.
13,18,LUCIFER,"Wow. They would never treat my old man that way. Ever. If he said, ""Scour the Earth,"" they'd say, ""S.O.S. or Brillo?"""
13,18,SISTER JO,"Yeah, well, you're not him. Your father created. You inherited."
13,18,LUCIFER,"Yeah? Well, I'm the one on the throne right now, and y'all are gonna treat me that way, okay?"
13,18,SISTER JO,"Uh-huh. Well, before all of us start treating you like God, you might try acting like God. Just a thought."
13,18,ASMODEUS,"This is unacceptable. Ketch, who's wily, possible he could fly under the radar. But the archangel? The archangel. I should at least detect a blip. We're connected. You might say we're blood brothers."
13,18,ASMODEUS,Get.
13,18,DEAN,What's the hold-up?
13,18,KETCH,"Oh, just practicing stealth. You know, the art of infiltrating a hostile and unfamiliar environment  whilst remaining undetected. Hence, ""free."" Hence, ""effective"". You, I see, prefer the bull-in-a-china-shop technique."
13,18,DEAN,"No, I prefer the ""let's find Charlie before the angels turn her inside-out' technique."
13,18,KETCH,Remind me again why we're risking everything to find this girl?
13,18,DEAN,Because she's seen my mom. She's seen Jack. We need her.
13,18,KETCH,And you're sure that's what this is about? You're sure it's not... personal?
13,18,DEAN [groaning],Aah!
13,18,DEAN,"Oh, you're a strong one! Angels'll pay double for you. Most of the slaves is a mite scrawny."
13,18,KETCH,"Where were you going to take him? You do want to live, yes?"
13,18,DEAN,You heard him. Where were you gonna take me?
13,18,MAN,You think I'm gonna tell you?
13,18,MAN [screaming],Aah!
13,18,DEAN,Let try that again.
13,18,MAN,The silo.
13,18,DEAN,What silo?!
13,18,MAN,"P.O.W. camp. Four, five hours from here. Follow the road."
13,18,DEAN,Okay. Thanks.
13,18,CASTIEL,Sam!
13,18,SAM,What is this? Is -- Did he do this? Enochian?
13,18,CASTIEL,It's his story. Starts with his death. Or...what appeared to be his death.
13,18,CASTIEL,"Well … He goes on and on for quite a while about porn stars and, uh..."
13,18,SAM,"Cass, please."
13,18,CASTIEL,"Okay, so Gabriel was captured, delivered to Asmodeus."
13,18,CASTIEL,"Well, obviously, his intellect is intact."
13,18,SAM,Yeah. So why isn't he talking to us?
13,18,CASTIEL,I don't know. Maybe he can't.
13,18,SAM,Or maybe he's choosing not to. Maybe he thinks it's safer that way.
13,18,LUCIFER,"Ready or not, world, New God is open for 'bidness'. All right, children... I shall hear your prayers."
13,18,LUCIFER [scowling],Unbelievable. Losers. Whining. I can't believe Pop put up with it as long as he did.
13,18,YOUNG PRIEST,Cessa decipere humanas creaturas... eisque aeternae perditionis venenum propinare!
13,18,FATHER DAVIS,"Most glorious Prince of the Heavenly armies, Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us!"
13,18,DEMON,"Don't get holier-than-thou with me, Father Davis. You and your camgirl addiction."
13,18,FATHER DAVIS,"Begone, Satan! You shall no more dare to deceive the human race!"
13,18,LUCIFER,"Okay, fellas. Fellas?"
13,18,DEMON,"Oh, crap."
13,18,LUCIFER,"Okay, first of all, chill. Couple things, guys. [points at the demon] Not Satan. Minor player. Total nobody, gettin' a day rate. [talking to the demon] Anthony... what are you doing, man?"
13,18,DEMON,Just having a little fun.
13,18,LUCIFER,Yeah?
13,18,DEMON,Mm-hmm.
13,18,LUCIFER,Beat it. Get outta here!
13,18,LUCIFER,Don't come back!
13,18,LUCIFER,You're welcome.
13,18,YOUNG PRIEST,Who are you?
13,18,LUCIFER,I'm Lucifer.
13,18,FATHER DAVIS,No.
13,18,LUCIFER,Yeah.
13,18,YOUNG PRIEST,Lucifer is the beast! The scourge of mankind!
13,18,LUCIFER,"Whoa. Ho. Ouch. Yeah, gotta hand it to the old man. Perfect marketing. Okay, little known factoid -- Pop made me into the fall guy. He made me into the all-purpose villain. It's sort of worked out okay because I'm... sort of running Heaven right now."
13,18,LUCIFER,"It's a new suit, thank you very much."
13,18,LUCIFER,Whoa! Calm down!
13,18,LUCIFER,Relax.
13,18,LUCIFER,Aah! Damn it.
13,18,KETCH,"That Hunter may've been a bumpkin, but his weaponry is cutting-edge. These I don't even recognize."
13,18,DEAN,"Yeah, that's... Angel-killing bullets. Might wanna hang on to those."
13,18,KETCH,Mm.
13,18,DEAN [grimacing],Ah.
13,18,KETCH,You don't look good.
13,18,DEAN,"Yeah, well, you're not my type, either. I'm fine."
13,18,KETCH,We'll take a break. Your wound may be more serious than we thought.
13,18,DEAN,"Aw, he barely hit me. Come on, we don't have time for this."
13,18,KETCH,"Eh, by all means. What was it with you and this Earthly ""Charlie,"" anyway? Old girlfriend? Let me guess -- she broke your heart."
13,18,KETCH,"Dean. Oh, God, you're burning up. Let's take a look at that wound."
13,18,DEAN,"No, no, I'm fine. We gotta keep moving."
13,18,KETCH,Do shut up. Huh?
13,18,DEAN,"How's it look, Mom?"
13,18,CASTIEL,"I must reiterate -- it's not possible for an angel to heal an archangel. I'm just trying to jolt his mind into thinking straight. Even then, Sam... Gabriel... it's -- it's possible that he's lost."
13,18,KETCH,"Taro root, trace of arsenic... basidiomycota... and..."
13,18,DEAN,"Why don't you just skip the birdseed, give me the flask?"
13,18,KETCH,Your shortness of breath and delirium are symptoms of a poison the Men of Letters use to disable monsters in the field.
13,18,DEAN,Of course it is.
13,18,KETCH,My guess is that the bounty hunter used a similar toxin to coat his bullets to hobble his prey... at first.
13,18,DEAN,"What do you mean, ""at first""?"
13,18,KETCH,"Well, if -- if the antidote isn't administered, then the victim dies a particularly gruesome death."
13,18,DEAN,You guys are such dicks.
13,18,KETCH,Yes. Well... guilty.
13,18,KETCH,Now then... this will smart. There we are. Good lad. Good lad. Good lad.
13,18,KETCH,"Here we go, just a little more. Right? There we are."
13,18,SAM,"Gabriel, you have to dig yourself out of this hole. Look, I know you think it's safer inside. No more torture. No more pain. No more expectations. I've been there. You were nothing like your family. You sure as hell weren't like your dad. Me either. And just like you, I got out. Or I-I thought I got out. But then... then my family needed me. And this is my life. No matter how many times I tried to fight it, this is what I was put here to do. This is where I make the world a better place. And sure, yeah, hookers in Monte Carlo sounds great, but your family needs you. Jack, your nephew, needs you. The world needs you. We need you. [pleading] Gabriel, I need you. So, please, help us."
13,18,GABRIEL,Porn stars.
13,18,GABRIEL,"They were porn stars, Sam."
13,18,ASMODEUS,There you are.
13,18,KETCH,This is absurd. You must rest.
13,18,DEAN,"Okay, look... I-I'll give you that... anti-poison merit badge award, okay? I do appreciate it, but... we're running out of time. So... How about you rest? I'm gonna keep going."
13,18,DEAN,In five minutes.
13,18,KETCH,Good plan. Perhaps we can use this moment to revisit the Charlie issue.
13,18,DEAN,Not gonna happen.
13,18,KETCH,"To your point, we are running out of time. We don't know where your mother and Jack are. We don't even know if we'll find this Charlie. And if we do, a rescue may be impossible and stupid. I propose we return home, regroup, reinforce ourselves, and we may have a shot at saving everyone."
13,18,DEAN,"All right, look, I'm gonna... repeat myself. Charlie's not gonna give the angels what they want."
13,18,KETCH,Your Charlie wouldn't.
13,18,DEAN,"They're gonna kill her, 100%, and I'm not..."
13,18,KETCH,What? What's the story you're not telling me?
13,18,DEAN,"Charlie was like family. She was a sister to me. She did more for me and Sam than I can even say. And she was... she was butchered. And we couldn't get there in time, and I..."
13,18,KETCH,You feel you failed her.
13,18,DEAN,I know I did.
13,18,KETCH,"That, I understand."
13,18,DEAN,"Uh, hello? What about your story you're not telling me?"
13,18,KETCH,"Oh, I've had many failures... friends and colleagues who have died on my watch. Only difference is, I didn't... try to save them. ""Duty"" and all that... rubbish."
13,18,DEAN,"Well, you do suck."
13,18,KETCH,What the hell? Perhaps rescuing this Charlie will wash some of the stain off my hands.
13,18,DEAN,"Impossible and stupid, huh? You say that like it's a bad thing. Come on."
13,18,COMMANDER,One more time. The location and number of bases the Resistance holds.
13,18,AW CHARLIE,One more time -- bite me.
13,18,AW CHARLIE,Sorry. Sorry. I'll try harder. Bite me!
13,18,COMMANDER,This is pointless. She dies.
13,18,CASTIEL,Is it helping?
13,18,GABRIEL,I...I don't know.
13,18,SAM,Hello?
13,18,ASMODEUS,"Samuel. [Gabriel looks terrified at the sound of his voice]. I hope you're having a pleasant day. It's come to my attention you boys have something belongs to me, and I'd like it back."
13,18,SAM,I don't know what you're talking about.
13,18,ASMODEUS,"Oh, I believe you do. And I'm-a give you one chance to return him to me. No harm, no foul."
13,18,SAM,I'm hanging up.
13,18,ASMODEUS,"Do not hang up on me. Gabriel is of no use to you in his current condition. Should you choose to resist me, I will have no choice but to take him by force. I will reduce you and that sad little bunker of yours to ashes. You got 10 minutes to decide. Now you can hang up."
13,18,LUCIFER,"Nothing in this universe is worth my time or talent. Nothing. Humans, angels... all flawed beyond redemption."
13,18,SISTER JO,Lucifer...
13,18,LUCIFER,"It's all because of Pop's little... propaganda machine, spewing poison about me for centuries. Done."
13,18,SISTER JO,"So, you're just giving up?"
13,18,LUCIFER,"No. No, I'm gonna refocus. I've come to realize the key to finding my bliss is fatherhood."
13,18,SISTER JO,You.
13,18,LUCIFER,"Yeah. It's obvious, right? I just...I devote myself to finding Jack. We're gonna combine our powers. I'll remake the world in my image, with pathetic little people who worship me. Me. Me. Love that good plan. Awesome plan."
13,18,SISTER JO,Finding your bliss?
13,18,LUCIFER,Yeah?
13,18,SISTER JO,"So, humans don't like you. Oh, wow. I'm sorry. Instead of bellyaching about it, why don't you make Heaven right? Make good on your promises. Make angels. Give the existing ones their wings back."
13,18,LUCIFER,"Yeah, I-I can't really do that."
13,18,SISTER JO,What?
13,18,LUCIFER,"I lied, so, uh, just keep that to yourself, though, okay?"
13,18,SISTER JO,"So, you know -- It's not the humans. It's not the angels. It's not your father's propaganda that's killing you. It's your complete failure. You say you want to find your son, but you don't. Not really. So, you sit there because you're afraid. You're afraid of him, afraid of looking into in his eyes and seeing nothing but contempt. You can't replace your father. You can't create anything. You have nothing. You might as well go back to the Cage."
13,18,SISTER JO,And now you don't have me.
13,18,DEAN,"Silo. No, he wasn't kidding."
13,18,KETCH,Gratifying. Now what?
13,18,COMMANDER,The Resistance will be broken. It is being broken.
13,18,COMMANDER,"One by one, your leaders are being rooted out and destroyed. Soon, there'll be none of you left."
13,18,AW CHARLIE,No! No! No!
13,18,COMMANDER,"For high crimes, the prisoner Charlie Bradbury, like all traitors before her, will be executed."
13,18,COMMANDER,All hail Michael.
13,18,DEAN,We gotta get you outta here.
13,18,AW CHARLIE,Who the Hell are you?
13,18,DEAN,No time! We gotta go now! Cmon!
13,18,SAM,"All right, I did what I could to help the bunker's warding, but who knows if it's enough. How's he?"
13,18,CASTIEL,I don't know.
13,18,SAM,Thanks.
13,18,ASMODEUS,"Your warding wasn't designed for the likes of me, Samuel. I've come to claim
what's mine."
13,18,ASMODEUS,"Oh, I missed you, boy. I'm-a have to punish you rather severely, I'm afraid."
13,18,ASMODEUS,And as for you two...
13,18,SAM,Aah!
13,18,CASTIEL,Aah!
13,18,ASMODEUS,"Gabriel! What are you doin', son? You know too well what I can do to you. I broke you!"
13,18,ASMODEUS,You're too weak!
13,18,GABRIEL,"Not anymore. Oh, by the way, I always hated that dumbass suit."
13,18,AW CHARLIE,"So, to recap, there's another world, a ""better"" world, with no Michael, and it has another me?"
13,18,DEAN,"Well, had."
13,18,AW CHARLIE,And you were friends with her. Me? Her?
13,18,DEAN,Yes. Very.
13,18,AW CHARLIE,How very?
13,18,DEAN,"Well, she was into chicks."
13,18,AW CHARLIE,Oh. I like her.
13,18,DEAN,"Look, I know this is a lot of information, everything I'm telling you, okay, but... we're running out of time here. I need to know where the Nephilim is -- Jack. And -- and my mom's with him, right?"
13,18,AW CHARLIE,Your mom?
13,18,DEAN,"Yes. She's from our world, too."
13,18,AW CHARLIE,"Uh...Last I heard, they were fighting somewhere in what remains of Dayton, Ohio, but I don't... Wait. Your mom?"
13,18,DEAN,Yeah.
13,18,AW CHARLIE,Why would I believe any of this?
13,18,DEAN,Because of that.
13,18,AW CHARLIE,Wow.
13,18,GABRIEL,"Whoa. Too much information. Okay, slow down. I'm not...processing."
13,18,CASTIEL,"And there's more. Michael wants to come to this Earth and destroy it, and we may need your help to fight him."
13,18,GABRIEL,What?
13,18,SAM,Yeah. Welcome to the team.
13,18,GABRIEL,"Uh...yeah. Not so much. I mean, thank you for the rescue and for the redemption arc. But, uh, I'm not really a team guy, so...I'm gonna bounce, okay? Um, but, you know, it's been, um... What's the opposite of fun? That."
13,18,SAM,"No, Gabriel, don't -- you -- you can't just walk away. If Michael comes here, he will end this world."
13,18,GABRIEL,"And the last time the world was ending, I put my money on you. I think you can pull it off again."
13,18,CASTIEL,No. You cannot turn your back on your father's creation.
13,18,GABRIEL,Castiel... my father turned his back on his creation. Guess it just runs in the family.
13,18,SAM,"No, Gabriel, please."
13,18,DEAN,Okay. The thing's gonna be closed any minute. We gotta get a go.
13,18,KETCH,"Dean, you need to go through. Bring back Sam and your angel and Gabriel and the bloody Navy SEALs, whatever help you can get. But I should stay."
13,18,KETCH,Wait. What?
13,18,KETCH,"If we're going up against Michael, we need to be ready. We need to know what he's up to, where your mother and Jack are."
13,18,AW CHARLIE,"I'm staying, too."
13,18,DEAN,Are you kidding? You got Michael and a billion angels on your ass.
13,18,AW CHARLIE,"Dude, this is my home. My friends are here and they're in trouble. If you really do have a way to take down Michael, get back here and do it. Until then, this is my fight."
13,18,DEAN,I don't wanna lose you again.
13,18,AW CHARLIE,That's not your call.
13,18,KETCH,"Dean, it's closing."
13,18,SAM,Dean! Dean! Hey! Hey. Hey. You're hurt.
13,18,DEAN,"No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine."
13,18,SAM,"Hey, the -- the -- the rift, it's..."
13,18,SAM,Where's Mom? Where's Jack?
13,18,DEAN,"Long story -- so Mom and the kid, they're not with Michael anymore. Ketch and Charlie are staying back to try to find them. There's a Charlie over there. She kicks ass."
13,18,SAM,"Uh, Charlie...Bradbury?"
13,18,DEAN,Yeah.
13,18,DEAN,What's this? What -- what... What'd I miss?
13,18,CASTIEL,"There was a demon incursion, led by Asmodeus."
13,18,DEAN,"Sorry, Asmodeus got in here?"
13,18,SAM,"Yeah, and -- and -- and Gabriel killed him."
13,18,DEAN,"Gabriel? That's great. So, he's back. Where is he?"
13,18,CASTIEL,He just left.
13,18,DEAN,"What do you mean, he left?"
13,18,CASTIEL,"Um... We asked Gabriel to help us, and then... then he said ""no""""."
13,18,DEAN,"He doesn't get to say ""no."" We still have his grace, though, right? Sam?"
13,18,SAM,"Uh, we -- we used his grace to -- to heal him. So, it -- it's gone. It's all gone."
13,18,DEAN,"So, if it's gone, then that means that we can't open that door again. [yelling] If we can't open the door, then I should've never come back!"
13,18,DEAN,"Every time we get close, it always falls apart. Every freakin' time."
13,18,CASTIEL,Dean... we will find Gabriel. We will.
13,18,DEAN,We better.
13,18,LUCIFER,(shaky breath) I don't know.
13,19,Dumah,"Castiel, our numbers are greatly diminished after the fall. No one's made new angels since the dawn of creation. We're going extinct."
13,19,Angel,"You did well, Dumah. You delivered him as promised. We hear you have influence with the nephilim."
13,19,Castiel,No. I will not help you.
13,19,Angel,Ever the renegade.
13,19,Dean,You just let the deadliest witch in the world walk away with a page from this book.
13,19,Sam,"If she’s right, and if she does see Lucifer again, then… I hope she makes him suffer. And if Rowena breaks bad, I will hunt her down myself and put a bullet in her."
13,19,Dean,"One needle stops the heart, the other one starts it up again."
13,19,Sam,"Dean, you’re talking about killing yourself."
13,19,Dean,"[Preparing the syringe] Yeah? Well, it worked before."
13,19,Sam,That’s an insane risk to take. Dean!
13,19,Jessica,"Hello, my name is Jessica. I'm a reaper and I’m here to lead you to your next life."
13,19,Billie,"Hey, Dean."
13,19,Dean,"Billie. No, I saw Cas kill you."
13,19,Billie,"Kill one incarnation of Death, like you did, the next Reaper to dies takes his place."
13,19,Dean,So you died to become Death?
13,19,Asmodeus,"I've come to claim what's mine. [Gabriel fights back against the demons restraining him] Gabriel! What are you doin', son? I broke you!"
13,19,Sam,Welcome to the team.
13,19,Gabriel,I'm not really a team guy. I'm gonna bounce.
13,19,Sam,"No, Gabriel. Please."
13,19,Rowena,"Hello boys. I’m very sure I've done nothing that you know of to make you want to call, but how lovely to hear from you."
13,19,Sam,"Rowena, that’s not…we, um..."
13,19,Rowena,You’ll have to speak up.
13,19,Dean,We need your help.
13,19,Rowena,Really?
13,19,Castiel,"We must assemble our most powerful allies to rescue our family and confront the Archangel 
Michael. Now, he's in an alternate universe so--"
13,19,Rowena,"Ah, the handsome angel is there, isn’t he? Hello tweety pie."
13,19,Castiel,"Um, hello."
13,19,Dean,Project?
13,19,Sam,What project?
13,19,Rowena,"Oh, nothing for you to worry about. Just checking a few items off my little to-do list."
13,19,Dean,"Sure, that didn’t sound ominous."
13,19,Sam,"Rowena, are you at a... party or something?"
13,19,Rowena,"I am, but I’m surprised you recognise the sounds of a party, seeing as how you're all work and no play."
13,19,Dean,"Look, we didn’t call to talk. We…the world is in danger, Rowena."
13,19,Dean,Damn it.
13,19,Castiel,"You know, she’s right. You never go to parties."
13,19,Elizabeth,Hello.
13,19,Rowena,"You’re  Elizabeth Mahler, aren’t you?."
13,19,Elizabeth,Yes. Do I know you?
13,19,Rowena,"No, but I know you. I saw you in the newspaper, didn’t I? In the Oregon Tribune?"
13,19,Elizabeth,There’s no need to bring up any of that unpleasantness.
13,19,[INTERIOR,the bunker kitchen. Dean makes himself a cup of coffee and talks with Cas]
13,19,Dean,You know what? Forget Rowena. There’s gotta be some other way we can track down Gabriel and hijack his grace.
13,19,Castiel,Even though he could be any place on earth?
13,19,Dean,Yes.
13,19,Castiel,"Or technically, anywhere in the entire universe."
13,19,Dean,"I didn’t say it was gonna be easy, but uh… All right, come on. Ideas. [closes his eyes and rubs his hands together] Come on. Here we go. [Dean sips his coffee and Cas sighs, neither have any ideas] Nah. I need a real drink. I’m gonna get a beer. You wanna beer?"
13,19,Castiel,No.
13,19,Dean,I’ll get a beer.
13,19,Castiel,The Angels.
13,19,Dean,What?
13,19,Castiel,Maybe Heaven could help us.
13,19,Dean,"Ah, not for nothing, but don’t the angels mostly want to kill you?"
13,19,Castiel,Yes. Yeah. This would be something of a Hail Mary.
13,19,Dean,Hmm.
13,19,Castiel,"It’s a sports term, like slam dunk or, uh... ball handler."
13,19,Dean,"That’s, uh… Mnh-mnh. No, I don’t think it's a good idea."
13,19,Castiel,"Well, Dean, we don’t have any good ideas."
13,19,Dean,"Okay, just... let’s just not barrel through with that like, uh, you know, like the Donatello thing."
13,19,Castiel,"We had our disagreement, but we got results."
13,19,Dean,That don’t make it okay.
13,19,Castiel,"I hear your concerns, and yes, the angels loathe me, and there’s going to be dangers, but Heaven doesn’t want the world to end any more than we do."
13,19,Castiel,This is-- This is something that I have to try.
13,19,Sam,We got a problem.
13,19,Dean,Another one? Awesome.
13,19,Sam,"All the stuff that Rowena said on the phone-- uh, Pacific Northwest, art gallery, party-- I-I think I found her."
13,19,Dean,A rich lady exploded?
13,19,Sam,"Yeah. Uh, local cops are-- are calling it spontaneous combustion. Pretty much."
13,19,Castiel,"Well, that does sound like Rowena."
13,19,Dean,"I knew it. I freaking knew it, man. You gave her that page. What'd you think was gonna happen, huh?"
13,19,Sam,She wanted to protect herself.
13,19,Dean,"Yeah, by barbecuing someone?"
13,19,Sam,We don’t know what this is yet. Maybe she had a reason to--
13,19,Dean,Doesn’t matter what the reason is. That’s not okay!
13,19,Sam,"Okay, I said if Rowena goes bad again I’d deal with it, so I’ll deal with it."
13,19,Dean,"You better. Cas, you wanna try this angel thing, then go for it. Just don’t get dead again."
13,19,Castiel,Hello!
13,19,Castiel,Indra?
13,19,Indra,"Castiel, nice blade. Uh, are we going to fight?"
13,19,Cas,"No, no I don’t-- I don't want to. I… I just need to get into Heaven."
13,19,Indra,"Ok, who’s stopping you?"
13,19,Cas,This isn’t exactly the welcome I was expecting.
13,19,Indra,"Yeah, well, we’re all learning how to deal with disappointment lately. Look  I could, uh... get it together to, uh... battle if you want. I mean, none of the angels are exactly thrilled with your, uh, ""ongoing adventures."" But personally? Meh."
13,19,Cas,Is that a… are you drunk?
13,19,Indra,"Well, not yet, but if I keep drinking at a pace, it starts to at least take the edge off."
13,19,Cas,"Indra, this is an important responsibility. You’re guarding the gates of Heaven."
13,19,Indra,"Oh, you think it’s an important responsibility? You?"
13,19,Indra,"Hey, hey, between us, if you wanna just... say we fought and angel blade me right now, that’d be ok."
13,19,Cas,Is that a joke?
13,19,Indra,Is it?
13,19,Cas,"Indra, what’s wrong?"
13,19,Indra,"See for yourself. And for what it’s worth, good luck."
13,19,Cas,Hello! Hello…hello…
13,19,Dumah,"Castiel, I think, I think that maybe we could help each other."
13,19,Dean,Still no answer?
13,19,Sam,"Yep, still no answer"
13,19,Dean,"You know I don’t wanna be right about this but… I mean, look, I want the fun flirty Rowena that mostly helps us, but you gotta be ready for, uh… not that."
13,19,Jessica,Or maybe she just has bad cell reception.
13,19,Dean,What the hell??!
13,19,Sam,Who are you?
13,19,Jessica,"Hi, Dean."
13,19,Dean,Wait… Jessica?
13,19,Sam,So you know her?
13,19,Dean,"Yeah, she’s a reaper. She tried to take me into the light. Didn’t work out."
13,19,Jessica,It really didn’t. And honestly it’s been a little sad watching you go this long without telling Sam about me.
13,19,Sam,"Hold on a second. What do you mean ""watching?"""
13,19,Jessica,"Well, after Dean’s little trip to the Veil, Death asked me to keep an eye on you two, in case."
13,19,Dean,In case of what?
13,19,Jessica,"This, I guess. I don’t ask Death questions. Never goes well."
13,19,Sam,"So what, you-- you’ve just been... hovering around us, invisible, like a-- like a baby sitter?"
13,19,Jessica,"No, no more like a baby monitor."
13,19,Sam,"And-- and you’ve seen, um..."
13,19,Jessica,"Oh, everything."
13,19,Jessica,"I’m especially fond of Sam’s impressive… extensive array of hair products. [looks at Dean] Not to mention, the three day old bacon cheeseburger in your room, or the VHS tape hidden under your bed labeled ""Sweet Princess Asuka Meets the Tentacles of Ple--"""
13,19,Dean,"Okay, all right, all right, that’s not cool, okay? That’s-- First of all, that’s a classic. Secondly, the burger's for emergency cases only."
13,19,Sam,Okay. Gross. Now why are you just manifesting now?
13,19,Jessica,"People in Portland have been dying outside of their assigned times, because apparently someone has become powerful enough to do that."
13,19,Sam,Rowena?
13,19,Jesica,So I’ve been instructed to offer my assistance as a resource.
13,19,Jessica,Four. So far.
13,19,Sam,"Yeah, okay, well, uh, we’re handling it."
13,19,Jessica,But if you need anything--
13,19,Sam,"We don’t, and we won’t."
13,19,Jessica,"Cool. Well, I’m around. Always."
13,19,Dean,"Okay. Well you know, we could've actually used her help."
13,19,Sam,We could... Seriously? You trust her?
13,19,Dean,"No I don’t trust her. But between the-- the reapers and Death, the hell’s this witch got us into, huh?"
13,19,Rowena,"I’ve become too sentimental. That’s the problem. Whoever would've expected. [her phone rings, it's Sam calling, she doesn't answer] Oh, this won’t be fun, Bernard. The Winchesters keep calling and they won’t just give up. They’ll come here. But we won’t let anyone stop me from fixing things. I’m capable of anything now. Anything. [her eyes glow purple]"
13,19,[EXTERIOR,"Day, LaVeau Gallery. Sam and Dean arrive dressed as FBI agents and go inside to examine the scene of Elizabeth Mahler's death]"
13,19,Sam,"Uh, the victim’s name was Elizabeth Mahler. I'm in her e-mails right now."
13,19,Dean,Anything look like Rowena bait?
13,19,Sam,"Hard to say. Um… so Mahler was the CFO of a local pharmaceutical company. Getting a lot of traction on the lo-- Oh, wow."
13,19,Dean,What?
13,19,Sam,"Look at this… [Sam shows Dean the an article on his tablet] Pirodine pharmaceuticals. According to this article, they sold thousands of improperly labelled drugs."
13,19,Dean,"So, what, people got sick?"
13,19,Sam,"People died. Uh, wow. Mahler’s lawyer got her off on a technicality."
13,19,Dean,"Okay. So, what? You think she deserved it?"
13,19,Sam,"No, I’m done defending Rowena, okay? I'm-- I’m just reading what’s there."
13,19,Dean,"Okay, I have a question. If that’s Elizabeth Mahler, [he points to a second, faint burn marn on the floor beside Elizabeth's ashes] who the hell is that?"
13,19,Sam,I don't know. Article only mentioned one person. Wait a second. I’ve seen something like that before. [he searches on his tablet] No way. That is what’s left of a reaper. [he shows Dean an image on the internet]
13,19,Dean,I have an idea… come on.
13,19,Sam,What?
13,19,Dean,Yo! Jessica!
13,19,Jessica,Hi.
13,19,Sam,"Hi. So, uh, that dead reaper in there, is that why you’re all of a sudden so interested in helping?"
13,19,Jessica,I’m glad you’re ready to chat now. This will be a positive experience.
13,19,Dean,"Okay, you can drop the whole warm and fuzzy thing."
13,19,Jessica,That’s just a useful affect. I’m still an instrument of death.
13,19,Sam,"You know, you could have told us Rowena was killing reapers."
13,19,Jessica,"And I would have, but you were ""handling it."""
13,19,Dean,"Okay, all right. Talk."
13,19,Jessica,Rowena’s changing people’s fates. She’s killing them before their time and when a reaper shows…
13,19,Sam,"She torches them, too."
13,19,Jessica,Yes.
13,19,Dean,Why?
13,19,Jessica,"You’ll have to ask her when you stop her. Because if she keeps this up, she's going to throw off fate. The whole greater machinery of death."
13,19,Sam,That means...
13,19,Jessica,Have you ever heard of the butterfly effect?
13,19,Dean,Ashton’s second best movie.
13,19,Jessica,"If just one person dies before their time, a lot of things that were supposed to happen, don’t. The ripple effect from just one early death can affect hundreds of lives. And changing their fates changes even more fates until things just become sincerely unfortunate, and we have to hit the reset button."
13,19,Sam,What does that mean?
13,19,Jessica,"Usually? A mass kill off. Like the Black Plague or a mid-sized war. Something to wipe the board clean. So… your help in avoiding that would be greatly appreciated, by everyone."
13,19,Dean,"If it’s so bad, why don’t you stop her?"
13,19,Sam,"What, me?"
13,19,Jessica,"Death keeps notebooks with all the ways a person might die, depending on their choices. Dean’s seen his."
13,19,Dean,I gotta whole shelf.
13,19,[INTERIOR,"Heaven's throne room. Cas is bored waiting and the lights repeatedly dim and brighten. Eventually, Dumah enters]"
13,19,Dumah,Sorry to keep you waiting.
13,19,Cas,"It’s fine. Actually, it’s-- it's not fine, because all of creation is at stake, but here we are."
13,19,Dumah,"Yes, well… There’s a lot going on."
13,19,Cas,"Yeah,  I noticed. Dumah, what did you mean that we could help each other?"
13,19,Dumah,"Find Gabriel and bring him back to us, back home, and we can help you with everything else--battling Michael, defending Earth."
13,19,Cas,I can’t find him… That’s why I need your help.
13,19,Dumah,"Right. Well, then, that’s a problem"
13,19,Cas,I don’t understand. Can’t you find a few angels to--
13,19,Naomi,"That’s enough, Castiel."
13,19,Naomi,It’s not that we won’t help you. It’s that we can’t.
13,19,Sam,"Okay, it definitely looks like she’s working her way through these Pirodine pharmaceutical people."
13,19,Dean,Have any idea who’s next?
13,19,Sam,"No, I mean everyone mentioned in the articles is already dead. Wait a second. Except for James Melford, the, uh, CEO."
13,19,Dean,"Alright, what do we know about him?"
13,19,Dean,Stop doing that!
13,19,Sam,What do you mean he-- he's--
13,19,Jessica,"James Melford's already bound for hell, but his time of death just shifted."
13,19,Sam,To when?
13,19,Jessica,Now.
13,19,Rowena,"This is a lovely backyard, but you really shouldn't have tried to run, James."
13,19,James,Who?
13,19,Rowena,"Shh. Wait for it. [her eyes glow purple as she looks around] Ah, there he is."
13,19,Reaper,You can see me?
13,19,Rowena,"Aye. Do you have a message for me from your boss? One quick chat, and all of this will end."
13,19,Reaper,Death doesn’t negotiate with witches.
13,19,Rowena,We'll see. Mors lumena!
13,19,Dean,"Well, so much for James Melford."
13,19,Jessica,And Martin. His  reaper. His name was Martin.
13,19,Sam,Here we go. Rowena.
13,19,Rowena,I don’t suppose there’s any way you’ll simply leave me to my business before something unfortunate happens?
13,19,Sam,"Oh, you’re starting off with a threat. Nice."
13,19,Rowena,I would never. But this doesn’t involve you boys.
13,19,Dean,You’re killing people. It involves us.
13,19,Rowena,"Mm, if you’d let me explain…"
13,19,Sam,You think this is something you can just explain away? I trusted you.
13,19,Rowena,"I know that, Sam. I’d just rather not talk about this over the phone. I’ll text you an address. Meet me there in half an hour."
13,19,Dean,And then what?
13,19,Rowena,You believe me or you don’t. Either way the drinks are on me.
13,19,Dean,"I don’t like it. I mean, what’s the over/under this is a trap?"
13,19,Sam,"Well, it’s Rowena. Of course it’s a trap."
13,19,Rowena,"Once we’re face to face, I’ll convince them to stop or we’ll stop them. Are you ready, Bernard?"
13,19,Cas,How are you alive?
13,19,Naomi,A drill in the head wasn’t going to kill me. You should know that.
13,19,Cas,"You know, I have to admit I was... I was relieved to hear you were dead."
13,19,Naomi,We never did see eye to eye.
13,19,Cas,"No, no we didn’t, because you stole my memories, and you threatened to ""tear me apart,"" and you made me repeatedly act out Dean Winchester’s murder, and you killed many, many people."
13,19,Naomi,Those were simpler times.
13,19,Cas,"""I’m sorry"" goes a long way."
13,19,Naomi,"Mm-hmm. After Metatron attacked, I had a few reliable angels spread the word that I was dead."
13,19,Cas,So you’ve been hiding?
13,19,Naomi,Recovering.
13,19,Cas,All this time?
13,19,Naomi,"Well, forgive me for taking a few years to put my thoughts back in my skull. There’s still a few holes-- pardon the phrasing-- but I’m mostly here. I have to be. [the lights fluctuate] Do you know what powers Heaven, Castiel?"
13,19,Cas,I don’t understand.
13,19,Naomi,"Well, then, let me make it divinely simple for you. There are a grand total of nine angels in Heaven, present company included, and one or two on Earth, and... that's all. We are the last men and women and divine waves of light still standing, as it were."
13,19,Cas,"No, that’s, uh… That’s not, um… I knew our numbers were small…"
13,19,Naomi,"You wanna know why we can’t help you?  Because none of us can leave. We’re the only things keeping the lights on. [lights dim again] Barely. We need everyone, especially an archangel. Now the others thought any archangel would do, Long story. But your news about Gabriel is… for lack of a better word, blessed. With his power we can keep heaven running."
13,19,Cas,And without him?
13,19,Naomi,"Without him, in time we’ll burn out. Heaven will crumble, and all the souls that have been entrusted to our care will fall back to earth. Picture it, Castiel-- billions upon billions of ghosts unleashed upon the world. All that chaos, all that death."
13,19,Dean,Heads up.
13,19,Rowena,Boys.
13,19,Rowena,"Just a precaution. We’re all wary, aren’t we? Surely you’ve got your witch killing bullets handy?"
13,19,Sam,"Rowena, this isn't why I helped you.Were you just playing the whole time?"
13,19,Rowena,"Of course not. But once I unlocked my power, I couldn’t just hide away. I realized I can right some wrongs that are long overdue."
13,19,Dean,By killing innocents?
13,19,Rowena,"Innocents?! These drug company people, they lied about their product for money-- money they used to avoid the law. They’ve hurt thousands of sick people, which makes them far worse than most of the monsters you’ve killed. I’m striking a blow for justice."
13,19,Sam,"Yeah, then why are you killing reapers?"
13,19,Rowena,Well... they’re just a means to an end. It’s not easy to get Death’s attention.
13,19,Dean,"Well, trust me, that’s not the kind of attention you want."
13,19,Rowena,"Oh, but it is. Death has something I want."
13,19,Sam,What’s that?
13,19,Rowena,"My son. After you told me he was gone, how he died, I had an unexpected reaction. We had our differences, but it’s my fault he went down the path he did. I left him."
13,19,Dean,"We’re talking about Crowley-- demon, King of Hell?"
13,19,Rowena,"We’re talking about Fergus-- a man abandoned and loveless, tricked by a demon, died in a gutter. He deserved better from the world. From me."
13,19,Dean,"Well, Crowley’s dead. There’s no coming back from that."
13,19,Rowena,"Oh, is that so, Dean? Are only Winchesters allowed to come back from the dead? The rest of us just have to accept it? I don’t think so. I’m putting death on notice."
13,19,Sam,"All right. Well, she’s taken notice."
13,19,Rowena,She?  Interesting.
13,19,Dean,And she’s upset. But you can quit this before--
13,19,Rowena,"I’m not afraid and as much as I enjoy our little talks, you can’t stop me."
13,19,Sam,"Actually, we can."
13,19,Rowena,And what makes you think that?
13,19,Rowena,I see.
13,19,Sam,"Yeah, but it’s not gonna happen tonight."
13,19,Rowena,"I hope you don’t mind astral projection? Safety first, boys."
13,19,Sam,Rowena! Hey Rowena! Hey!
13,19,Dean,You know she’s controlling your brain.
13,19,Bernard,"She’s powerful, she’s gorgeous, and she’s paying me a small fortune. That woman didn’t have to cast a spell on me."
13,19,Sam,"Rowena, stop!  Stay right there. Listen to me. I get what you’re trying to do for Crowley, but you’re messing with the machinery of the universe. Death won’t give you what you want. You have to stop."
13,19,Rowena,"I can’t stop, Samuel. You’ll have to shoot me."
13,19,Sam,H-h-how?
13,19,Jessica,"You're doing really well, but you need to hurry."
13,19,Jessica,Can’t… Clean hands.
13,19,Jessica,He was a highly trained military operative. It’s impressive that you could…
13,19,Rowena,Don’t struggle. It'll only make things worse.
13,19,Sam,"Rowena, you gotta listen to me. This power’s going to your head, okay? It’s making you go crazy."
13,19,Rowena,"No, it’s given me clarity. It’s shown me that everything I did before for wealth, for magic, for myself, meant nothing. And it took everything from me, everyone I loved-- my family, Oskar, my son. I’m a flawed, petty, evil creature, Samuel, and I don’t know if I can be redeemed, but I have to try. And I do wish there was another way."
13,19,Sam,You…wh… what are you saying?
13,19,Rowena,"Well, you said it yourself. There’s only one way to stop me-- you. But if you’re dead, well... then, I can’t be stopped, can I? Death will have to grant me an audience."
13,19,Sam,"Oh, no, you-- you-- you don’t know that!"
13,19,Rowena,"True, but there’s only one way to find out. [She cuts her hand]"
13,19,Sam,What are you doing? What is that? [Rowena pours liquid onto her palm]
13,19,Sam,"Rowena, don’t do this. You don’t have to do this."
13,19,Rowena,"What haven’t you done for your family? What wouldn’t you do? I’m sorry, Sam."
13,19,Death,"Hello, Rowena."
13,19,Rowena,You? I know you.
13,19,Death,We met when I was a reaper.
13,19,Rowena,"We totally did. If we’d just exchanged numbers, none of this would have been necessary."
13,19,Death,You’re upsetting the natural order. That’s... unwise.
13,19,Rowena,"Bring back my son, and it all stops. Say no, and I’ll--"
13,19,Death,No.
13,19,Rowena,"Then I’ll kill Sam Winchester. That’ll really frog up your natural order, won’t it?"
13,19,Death,Go ahead.
13,19,Rowena,What?
13,19,Death,"I don’t think it’s a good thing. And I don’t believe any of us will like what comes next, but I don’t do blackmail so… Go ahead."
13,19,Death,I’m curious to see what happens.
13,19,Sam,"No. No, no, no no no. No. Rowena. I know what you went through and I know how much you lost and I realize how much you want your family back. But don’t do this. This... this... This is not you. Not any more."
13,19,Rowena,"What happened to me, those were my choices. But Fergus never… It wasn’t fair. [Rowena turns towards death and screams] It's not fair! [Rowena blasts Death with purple light, which has no effect, and falls to her knees]"
13,19,Death,"You were never going to kill him. There was a time you would've, but not now."
13,19,Death,I can see that.
13,19,Rowena  [crying],I don’t know what I’m doing.
13,19,Death,"Sometimes life is unfair, and sometimes we lose things. And sometimes we make mistakes. And some of these things can never be fixed, no matter how powerful you become. Some things just are, and everyone has to live with that."
13,19,Rowena  [sobbing],And now you’ll take me?
13,19,Death,"No, you already know how your story ends. [Death looks at Sam]"
13,19,Dean,Sam.
13,19,Sam,Dean!
13,19,Death,"Hey, Dean. See you again soon. [Death disappears]"
13,19,Naomi,"If you find Gabriel, tell him what’s happening in Heaven."
13,19,Cas,And if I can’t find him?
13,19,Naomi,We’ll do our duty… keep things running.
13,19,Cas,For how long?
13,19,Naomi,"Ah, that’s the scary part."
13,19,Cas,We will find a way to fix this. We will.
13,19,Naomi,"This may be one of those things that can’t be fixed, Castiel."
13,19,Cas,This is Heaven we are talking about.
13,19,Naomi,"Everything ends, Castiel."
13,19,Cas,Everything ends.
13,19,Naomi,"But until then, the gates of Heaven are closed."
13,19,Sam,How you feelin?
13,19,Dean,Like I got punched in the face. A lot.
13,19,Sam,Huh.
13,19,Rowena,"Yes, about that… Bernard’s very enthusiastic."
13,19,Dean,"Yeah, that’s one word for it."
13,19,Rowena,"I fought Death and lost. I feel tired. Weaker. I don’t know if it’s forever. Sam, what have I done?"
13,19,Sam,You had a chance to kill me and you didn’t. I’d call that progress.
13,19,Dean,I’d call that a miracle. [Dean and Rowena exchange looks]
13,19,Sam,"You know, what happened with Crowley? That wasn’t your fault."
13,19,Rowena,He never had a chance.
13,19,Dean,"He made his choices, just like we all do. Look, every one of us has done something that we have to live with, that were trying to make up for. Every one of us."
13,19,Sam,"Even without all that extra juice, you’re still the deadliest witch around."
13,19,Rowena,Flatterer.
13,19,Sam,"Yeah, well, we, um... we may need your help. To save our family. To… hell, to save the world."
13,19,Dean,You wanna be redeemed? This would be a pretty big step.
13,19,Rowena,And do you think I still can be?
13,19,Sam,"We both do. But before you answer, you gotta know something. Um... Lucifer is back."
13,19,Rowena,Mm. Of course he is.
13,19,Dean,Now you’re not gonna…
13,19,Rowena,"Break down? Crack apart in terror? Of course I’m horrified and scared. My heart may have stopped but… Lucifer isn’t the one who’s going to kill me, is he?"
13,19,Sam,You changed other people’s fates. Maybe we can change yours?
13,19,Dean,So what do you say? You in?
13,21,CAS,"Dean, you can’t possibly eat another.  That’s your seventh piece."
13,21,JACK,Castiel’s right. I counted.
13,21,DEAN,It’s not even a whole pie.
13,21,JACK,Was he always like this?
13,21,DEAN,Mm.
13,21,SAM,"Thanks Mom.  You know what, let me help you."
13,21,SAM,"Hey, Mom, um, how you holding up? You haven’t really said much since you got back, you know -- how you’re doing.  How it was over there and..."
13,21,MARY,"It was hard. But somehow, I always knew that you... you and Dean would come and save us.  And you did."
13,21,SAM,Mom?
13,21,MARY,"Yes, Sam? Sam? (her voice has become robotic)"
13,21,SAM (puzzled),Mom?
13,21,MARY,Sam? Sam? Sam? (beeping of an alarm begins to accompany each word)
13,21,DEAN,Ow.
13,21,SAM,Hey. How’s Gabriel.
13,21,CAS,He said he needed a minute alone.  He wanted to extract his grace by himself.  (using air quote) In private.
13,21,CAS,So I left him alone in Dean’s room.
13,21,ROWENA,"I hate to interrupt, but I can’t be the only one to noticed the rather glaring hole in this plan."
13,21,ROWENA (continuing),"We open up the rift, it gives us a day to find and save your Mom and the boy.  And it’s a very big world over there, and you’re not even sure where they are, so..."
13,21,CAS,She’s right.  The clock may run out on us.
13,21,SAM,Yeah.  It might.
13,21,DEAN,"Yeah, well we don’t have any better ideas."
13,21,ROWENA,"Mm, that’s inspirational."
13,21,GABRIEL,Here it is!  The final ingredient -- a fresh serving of archangel grace.
13,21,ROWENA,This is what you call a serving?
13,21,GABRIEL,That is the jet fuel of divine emissions.
13,21,GABRIEL (continues),It’ll be more than enough to get the job done.
13,21,CAS,"Okay, everyone ready?"
13,21,SAM,"Yeah, all right."
13,21,DEAN,Let’s do this.
13,21,DEAN,Okay.
13,21,CAS,"Well, that was...fast."
13,21,SAM,"Very, very fast."
13,21,SAM,"All right, great.  What do we do now?"
13,21,DEAN,Hell if I know.
13,21,CAS,You do know.  We all do. [Rowena shoots a frightened glance at Sam.]
13,21,CAS,"We need archangel grace. Gabriel’s obviously running a little low, and we don’t know how long it’ll take him to recover.  So that leaves exactly one source on Earth."
13,21,SAM,No.
13,21,CAS,"I don’t like it either, but there is no other way."
13,21,CAS,We need Lucifer.
13,21,SAM,"Obviously, I want to get Mom and Jack back.  It’s all I want. It’s all I can think about.  But we’ve been down this road before.  Teaming up with Lucifer --"
13,21,DEAN,We’re not teaming up with him.
13,21,CAS,We just need his grace.
13,21,SAM (sarcastically),"Oh, ‘just’."
13,21,DEAN,We’ve trapped his ass before.
13,21,CAS (continues),"We let Lucifer out of the Cage, and he has never stopped being our responsibility."
13,21,GABRIEL,It’s not always like that.
13,21,GABRIEL,Just ’cause I take a little extra time to recover --
13,21,GABRIEL,It doesn’t make me any less of an archangel.
13,21,GABRIEL,"You know, it could have been you…"
13,21,ROWENA,Uh?
13,21,GABRIEL,…who screwed up that spell.
13,21,GABRIEL,"Just sayin’.  I heard your, uh, magical unbinding didn’t take, that you got knocked back down a peg.  Maybe it’s you who are off your game."
13,21,ROWENA (scathingly),A drunk 6-year-old could execute that magic.  It wasn’t the spellcaster or the spell. It was the ingredient.
13,21,GABRIEL,Think they’ll be much longer?
13,21,ROWENA,"The Three Amigos?  With their bro hugs, pep talks, and melodrama?  Count on it."
13,21,ROWENA,Mm.
13,21,ROWENA,How would you like to fill it?
13,21,GABRIEL,To fill what?
13,21,ROWENA,I know a thing or two about wounded masculine pride.
13,21,DEAN,So?
13,21,SAM,"No, you’re right.  You’re right.  I don’t like it, but it’s our only choice.  Another fun, great choice. (said sarcastically, but he seems anxious)"
13,21,DEAN,"Well, hey, bright side is, even if we do pull it off, we still only get 24 hours in the Apocalypse world.  And Rowena’s right.  We’ll be lucky to even hear a word of Mom and Jack, much less save ’em, so…"
13,21,SAM,Wait a second.
13,21,CAS (curious),What?
13,21,DEAN,Guys?
13,21,ROWENA (gasping),"Whoo, oh, ah."
13,21,ROWENA,Uh…we were just…
13,21,GABRIEL,"Reading.  Books.  Here in the, uh, library."
13,21,GABRIEL,Which is the room we’re in right now.
13,21,LUCIFER,"Keep  em comin’, pal, keep em comin’."
13,21,LUCIFER,"Yeah, it’s more like a curse.  Believe it or not, I’m barely even buzzed."
13,21,BARTENDER,"Still, that can’t be good for you."
13,21,LUCIFER (laughs),"Who cares?  You know, I had Heaven and Hell in the palm of my hand.  And you know what I learned?.  They don’t matter.  Nothing matters."
13,21,BARTENDER,Okay.
13,21,BARTENDER,Sorry to hear that.  But I’m sure things will work out in the end.  Jack will come around.
13,21,LUCIFER,Jack?  I never told you his name.
13,21,BARTENDER,You didn’t?
13,21,LUCIFER,Nah. Didn’t.
13,21,BARTENDER,"Ah, I swear that you did."
13,21,BARTENDER (mockingly),"What’s the matter, buddy?"
13,21,BARTENDER,"Yeah.  Kinda spiked your drink.  Think of it as a magical roofie -- powerful enough to bring down any archangel, even me."
13,21,GABRIEL,"Hey, brother."
13,21,LUCIFER,I killed you.
13,21,GABRIEL,Welcome back.
13,21,LUCIFER,"Okay.  What in the hell did you put in that drink, man?"
13,21,ROWENA (continuing),Very simple ingredients for a very potent spell.
13,21,LUCIFER,"Oh, hey, Sam."
13,21,LUCIFER,"Oh, look at this.  All the people I love to torture in the same room."
13,21,LUCIFER,"What’s the occasion, guys?"
13,21,LUCIFER,"Ah. Okay, I think I see what’s going on.  You’re planning a trip to save mother Mary, and you need my grace.  Is that about it?"
13,21,CAS,Good guess.
13,21,SAM,"Nah, those are just bonuses.  See, we got a lot of work to do back in Apocalypse world, but not a whole lot of time to do it.  So I realized something.  I realized we could use you."
13,21,ROWENA,Koth Munto Nuntox!
13,21,SAM,"And then, when we get back, then we’ll kill you."
13,21,ROWENA,Aye.  Someone needs to keep an eye on the Devil.  Go. Save your mum.
13,21,SAM,Ready.
13,21,GABRIEL,Ow!
13,21,SAM,"Okay.  Let’s get our bearings and head that way.  Cas, where are we?"
13,21,SAM,All right.
13,21,LUCIFER,"I don’t know, Red. I think I’d be a tad insulted if I were you. It’s not like you’ve got the posh job here of babysitting me."
13,21,ROWENA,"Mm.  Sorry, Lucille, I’m not biting."
13,21,LUCIFER,Okay.
13,21,CAS,"Have you, uh have you thought about what’s next, after we get back to earth?"
13,21,GABRIEL,"Uh, yeah, not so much,  seeing as we still gotta find Jack and Mary.  Ah, not to mention survive Michael and his super angel army."
13,21,CAS,Right.
13,21,GABRIEL,"Although, I did tick off some, uh, bucket list items recently.  Got some revenge.  Had sex with a 300-year-old redhead.  But what’s next for me? I don’t really know."
13,21,CAS,"This world is, um, is obviously glutted with angels, but back home in our world you know it’s -- it’s just Naomi and a handful of others.  They’re trying to keep the lights on, but Heaven’s dying, Gabriel."
13,21,GABRIEL,You serious?
13,21,CAS,Very.
13,21,GABRIEL,"And you think I could fix it?  Yeesh. I skipped out on Heaven, Castiel.  They wouldn’t want me back.  As far as they’re concerned, I’m a screw-up.  Hell, as far as I’m concerned, I’m a screw-up."
13,21,CAS,"Well, Heaven’s been run into the ground by upstanding angels.  Perhaps a screw-up is just the change we need."
13,21,SAM,Really?
13,21,DEAN,"Yeah, like you’re lighter, happier, more energetic."
13,21,BEARDED MAN,"Maggie, run!"
13,21,DEAN,What the Hell was that thing?
13,21,MAGGIE,What do you mean? A vampire.
13,21,SAM,It’s not like any vamp we’ve ever seen.
13,21,MAGGIE,Who are you?
13,21,SAM,"I’m Sam.  Uh, Dean, Gabriel and Cas. (pointing to each man with the tip of his bloody machete)  We uh…"
13,21,DEAN (interrupting),"We’re not from around here.  Tell me, what makes a bloodsucker look like that?"
13,21,BEARDED MAN,"Starvation.  When Michael’s armies started to wipe out the humans, they didn’t think about monsters or what happened to ‘em when their food source dried up.  Turns out, not eating makes them wild.  Nothing but pure, stupid appetite."
13,21,MAGGIE,Which way you headed?
13,21,DEAN,North.
13,21,MAGGIE,"To Dayton?  We were going that way too.  We heard the rebels, Jack and Mary, set up a satellite colony there, an outpost."
13,21,SAM,Wait.  What do you mean you were?
13,21,MAGGIE,"Me, Floyd (the bearded man) the rest of our group, we were crossing north through the Morehead tunnel...stumbled into a whole nest of those things."
13,21,FLOYD,Nine of us went in.  Only me and Maggie came out.
13,21,DEAN,"This tunnel, is it the only way north?"
13,21,MAGGIE,"There’s a mountain pass, but it’s a long way around.  Tunnel’s the quickest route."
13,21,GABRIEL,If the long way is the safe way…
13,21,SAM,No.  We’re already two days out from Dayton as it is.  We don’t have time for a detour.
13,21,SAM (determinedly),"Listen, we’ve faced worse than a nest of vamps before.  Much worse.  So if you still want to get to Dayton, we’ll keep you safe.  As far as we’re concerned, we’re going through that tunnel."
13,21,ROWENA,"Shut your mouth!  --Oh!  You want to get inside my head, twist the knife?  Two can play that game.  Do you know what your grace is making possible right now?  The heartfelt family reunion of Sam, Dean, Cas, Mary, and your very own son Jack. That's right. Your wee boy's over there, and he'll be so glad to see his three fathers. Of course, as far as he's concerned, they are his father. And you? You're nothing to him. Or me. Or anyone now. Nothing."
13,21,LUCIFER,"Ah, Red.  You shouldn’t have made me mad.  Step into my office."
13,21,LUCIFER,"You know...you and Gabe, you kicked me when I was down.  I didn’t have any fight.  I didn’t have anything to live for.  But you, you, you gave me something to fight for again.  My boy.  So for that, I’m going to be quick."
13,21,ROWENA (weakly),Bollocks!
13,21,ROWENA,"Fine. This isn’t how you wanted things to work out, but yes, Rowena, thanks to you, Sam and Dean’ll be trapped in some sort of nightmare universe with the Devil himself. And you’re the only person who might be able to devise a way to keep the door back home open for them. But...Sorry, boys. Au revoir, bon voyage, not my problem."
13,21,ROWENA (angrily),Bollocks!
13,21,ROWENA,Bums bollocks.
13,21,MAGGIE,You good?
13,21,FLOYD,"What do you think?  Second time’s a charm, right?"
13,21,SAM,"All right.  Here’s the plan.  Stay close, keep walking.  Anything moves, kill it."
13,21,DEAN,Let’s do this!
13,21,FLOYD,Arggh!
13,21,FLOYD,Sorry. Tripped.
13,21,SAM,"Wait, wait, wait.  Let me."
13,21,FLOYD,Maggie!  Maggie!
13,21,DEAN,Let’s keep moving.
13,21,DEAN,Hey.  We got a blocked passage over here.  Need to move some rocks.
13,21,MAGGIE,Guys!
13,21,MAGGIE,Floyd!
13,21,SAM,I’ve got it.  I’ve got it.
13,21,DEAN,Sammy!
13,21,CAS,Sam!
13,21,DEAN,Sammy!
13,21,CAS,He’s gone.
13,21,DEAN,No!
13,21,CAS (forcefully),We don’t have time!
13,21,CAS,We can’t save him.
13,21,MAGGIE,"Dean?  Um, about your friend...I’m so sorr --"
13,21,MAGGIE,We must be getting close to Dayton.  On the outskirts at least.
13,21,CAS,I-I-I can’t.  This...warding is too strong.
13,21,CAS,Whoa.
13,21,CAS,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.  We’re--we’re not here to fight."
13,21,CAS,We’re just looking for…
13,21,MARY,Castiel?
13,21,MARY,Dean...where’s Sam?
13,21,LUCIFER,Boo!
13,21,LUCIFER,"Hey, Sammy."
13,21,LUCIFER,I did.  You’re welcome.
13,21,LUCIFER,"Oh, well, I’m getting to that."
13,21,SAM (concerned),The rift.  The rift.  Rowena.
13,21,LUCIFER,"Oh, she’s okay.  I mean I -- I was going to kill her, but she blasted me here before I had a chance to, so... It’s great, self-defence. But, uh, I was coming here anyway."
13,21,SAM (puzzled),But we drained you.
13,21,LUCIFER,"So how did I have the juice to pull off my little Lazarus trick? Uh, that's a long story, but I was basically tracking you here, and then I came across a handful of Michael's angels and I... ate 'em. I guess it's not really a long story, is it?"
13,21,SAM,What do you want?
13,21,LUCIFER,Are you going?
13,21,LUCIFER,Here. It’s dark out there.
13,21,LUCIFER,"Yeah, they’re sorta...sorta all over there, and I’m holding them back."
13,21,LUCIFER,"They’re just waiting for a little snap of my fingers, but I didn’t want ‘em flooding in her and eatin’ ya again, not until we finished our convo."
13,21,LUCIFER,"I want what you already have -- a relationship with my son. Okay, there was a time that I would, you know, just grab him, but... I've grown."
13,21,SAM (sarcastically),I'm sure you have.
13,21,LUCIFER,"I have, Samuel. I want my son, and you're gonna help me."
13,21,SAM (puzzled),How?
13,21,LUCIFER,"Well, I don’t feel like he’ll give me a chance unless I come bearing gifts."
13,21,LUCIFER,Yup.  Boop! (tapping Sam on the chest)
13,21,LUCIFER,That’s you.
13,21,LUCIFER,"Look, Sammy, I'm -- I'm not asking you to -- to like it or to like me. All I'm asking is that you acknowledge the truth, that I was the one who brought you back to life, that I was the one who lifted you from the darkness and into the light. Okay?"
13,21,LUCIFER,"Apocalypse World, Michael's armies -- you really think you and your family can handle that stuff alone? You need me."
13,21,SAM,And what if I say no?
13,21,LUCIFER,"All right, let me just make this really, really, really easy -- easy enough for even you to understand, Sammy. I’m gettin’ to Jack, one way or the other.  The only question is are you coming with?"
13,21,LUCIFER,Or that?
13,21,LUCIFER,"Your move, champ."
13,21,CAS,"Jack, I --"
13,21,Gabriel,I’m not strong enough.
13,21,DEAN,"We have to go back, get his body."

14,16,SAM,"Mom doesn't want to leave these people, so let's take them with us."
14,16,SAM,"I hate this place right now. Those Hunters, t-that's on me. I brought them here. Everywhere I look, I see them. I see Maggie."
14,16,MAGGIE,Sam!
14,16,SAM,"You know, I think I just need some time."
14,16,ELIOT,And what about that kid with the dumb Bambi-look on his face all the time?
14,16,JACK,Hello.
14,16,JACK,I am a Winchester!
14,16,CASTIEL,You killed Michael. You consumed his grace. Do you have your powers back?
14,16,JACK,I'm me again.
14,16,CASTIEL,And your soul?
14,16,JACK,You want to know how much of my soul I had to burn off to kill Michael.
14,16,CASTIEL,Yes.
14,16,JACK,I don't know.
14,16,DEAN,"So, what's the verdict?"
14,16,DONATELLO,"I'd keep an eye on him, but I think... if he seems okay, he probably is."
14,16,JACK,I feel... different now.
14,16,BARBARA,What was that?
14,16,TOM,It was nothing. Just the wind.
14,16,BARBARA,"Okay, that -- that wasn't the wind."
14,16,TOM,I'll check it out.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,What are you guys doing?
14,16,TOM,Dad?
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Barbara.
14,16,BARBARA,"Hi, Sheriff."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Do your parents know where you are right now?
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,You're supposed to be studying.
14,16,TOM,"At Mom's. This is not your weekend. Besides, she's --"
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Out of town. With Todd. I know. She called you. You weren't home. She called me. She's worried.
14,16,TOM,"Well, you found me. Good for you."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Hey. Watch it.
14,16,TOM,Or what?
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"Hey, where you going?"
14,16,BARBARA,Um...bathroom. You guys need some space.
14,16,BARBARA,"Ugh. Oh, God."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"Tom, you shouldn't be out here. But I didn't mean to embarrass you."
14,16,TOM,"Yeah, you never do."
14,16,TOM,Barbara?!
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Stay here.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Barbara! Barbara! Barbara?
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Hey!
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Thomas! Thomas!
14,16,TOM,No! No! No...
14,16,DEAN,"Morning, sunshine."
14,16,SAM,Hey.
14,16,DEAN,What you looking at? Porn? Sex tapes? Nip slips?
14,16,SAM,"The Internet is more than just naked people. You do know that, right?"
14,16,SAM,"All right. Check this out. So, this girl -- her body was found just outside Big Creek State Park in Iowa. Uh, covered in bite marks. The police are saying it's an animal attack."
14,16,DEAN,But...?
14,16,SAM,"But I did some digging, and I found that there weren't a lot of bodies, but a lot of people do go missing in that park. Look at this. Park ranger back in '06. A poacher in '98. And on and on and on. I mean, I've only gone back to 1943, and I've already found 54 missing people."
14,16,DEAN,Wow.
14,16,SAM,Yeah.
14,16,DEAN,"Yeah. Sounds like our kind of thing. You sure you're up for it? I mean, I know you wanted to take some time."
14,16,SAM,"No, I-I'm -- I'm good. Honestly, I-I'm good."
14,16,DEAN,"All right. Well, let's hit it."
14,16,SAM,You got it. I'll grab Cas.
14,16,DEAN,Mm. He actually left.
14,16,SAM,What?
14,16,DEAN,Early this morning.
14,16,SAM,Why?
14,16,DEAN,I don't know. Something about being cooped up in the bunker for a few weeks. We all need to stretch our legs. I get it.
14,16,SAM,"All right. Uh, then, Jack."
14,16,DEAN,Uh... I don't want Jack on this.
14,16,SAM,I thought you said Donatello gave him the all clear?
14,16,DEAN,"Yeah, he did. And I'm -- I'm sure he's good. But... Jack's got his mojo back. His powers have gotten us in trouble in the past -- the security guard. So I just want to make sure that, you know, he's right before we put him back out there."
14,16,SAM,Yeah. Yeah.
14,16,DEAN,"Hey, uh...good reading?"
14,16,JACK,Yes. Did you know Article 246 of the Haitian criminal code officially makes it against the law to turn a human into a zombie?
14,16,DEAN,Good.
14,16,SAM,"Jack, listen. Dean and I are heading out on a case."
14,16,JACK,And...you don't want me to come?
14,16,SAM,"Look, truth is --"
14,16,DEAN,"We don't want to leave the bunker empty. In case, uh, Mom or... some of the other Hunters call and need help, so... And this place is long overdue for a restock. So, uh, your mission, should you choose to accept -- made you a list."
14,16,JACK,"My mission is shopping? [Jack reads from the list] Beer, TP, eggs... beer again."
14,16,SAM,Twice?
14,16,DEAN,Yeah.
14,16,JACK,I'll do it.
14,16,DEAN,Great! We'll be in touch.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,I'm sorry. I just don't really see how this is an FBI thing.
14,16,DEAN,Wildlife preserve is government property. We're the government.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"Yeah, well, it is a large piece of land -- coyotes, rough terrain. We try to limit hikers to the trails, but some of them don't listen."
14,16,SAM,"Okay, but the girl who died, she wasn't a hiker."
14,16,DEAN,Do you know what happened to her?
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"Like I said, coyotes."
14,16,SAM,"You know, do you mind if we take a look at the body?"
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Do I have a choice?
14,16,DEAN,Not really.
14,16,DEAN,Whoa! Mo--
14,16,SAM,Seriously? How long you been doing this?
14,16,DEAN,"Well, got catlike reflexes, okay? What can I say?"
14,16,DEAN,Said a coyote did this?
14,16,SAM,Not even close.
14,16,DEAN,Mnh-mnh.
14,16,SAM,Look at the skin around the bite. It looks...burnt.
14,16,DEAN,"So, what the hell can do that?"
14,16,STACY,"Eliot, stop."
14,16,ELIOT,What? The Ghostfacers are cool.
14,16,STACY,No. They're really not.
14,16,MAX,Uh... Is that what's his name? Bambi?
14,16,STACY,Hey!
14,16,JACK,Hello.
14,16,STACY,Are you lost?
14,16,JACK,Um... no.
14,16,ELIOT,"You live with Sam and Dean, right? They're not here right now. Are they fighting ghosts?!"
14,16,JACK,What's a ghost? I should go.
14,16,MAX,"Hey, it's...cool. We know. About their whole Hunter thing."
14,16,JACK,"Oh. Good. I don't like to lie. It makes my stomach hurt. Like when you have to burp, but you can't burp. Yeah."
14,16,STACY,"So, you need something?"
14,16,JACK,"I do, but the store's closed."
14,16,STACY,Not anymore.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Hey! Come in. You okay?
14,16,TOM,No. I think I should talk to them.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Who?
14,16,TOM,Barbara's parents.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"Tom, that's not a good idea. I've already spoken to them. They're grieving."
14,16,TOM,Dad. This was my fault.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,That's not true.
14,16,TOM,"Yes, it is."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"Tom, they just need a little time. We all do."
14,16,STACY,I feel... bad for him.
14,16,MAX,"Same. I mean, living with a bunch of dudes. Their whole place must smell like beer, Kleenex, and Old Spice."
14,16,ELIOT,I've been watching these guys called the Ghostfacers. You heard of 'em?
14,16,JACK,No.
14,16,ELIOT,"They're awesome! They know all about ghosts, and I'm reading books."
14,16,JACK,"Oh, I like books, too. I'm reading about zombies."
14,16,ELIOT,Zombies are real?
14,16,JACK,"Well, no. Not really. It's kind of disappointing. But there are other monsters."
14,16,ELIOT,Like what?
14,16,JACK,"Oh, vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters -- I've seen one of those -- djinn, rugaru -- That's a funny name. Yeah. Wraiths, sirens, demons, ghouls. All sorts of things."
14,16,JACK,Well...yes.
14,16,ELIOT,"Jack, will you be my best friend?"
14,16,STACY,"Dude, stop stalking him. Sorry. Ever since he found out about this stuff, he's been obsessed."
14,16,JACK,It's fine.
14,16,MAX,"Do you ever, like, hang out?"
14,16,JACK,"Well, we have movie nights on Tuesdays. Dean usually picks. I've seen ""Lost Boys"" like 36 times."
14,16,MAX,I mean with kids your own age.
14,16,JACK,"Well, I'm two. ...enty. I'm twenty. Two. I'm twenty two."
14,16,STACY,"Okay. Well, we're going to the Stoke place tomorrow, if you wanna chill."
14,16,MAX,It's this old farmhouse outside of town. No one goes there.
14,16,ELIOT,So we can talk about monsters.
14,16,STACY,And other non-freak things.
14,16,JACK,I... I think I'd like that.
14,16,STACY,"It's $37.08. But for the beer, I need to see some ID."
14,16,JACK,ID?
14,16,SAM,Kohonta.
14,16,DEAN,Gesundheit.
14,16,SAM,"No, not -- Kohonta. It's a -- It's a local Native American legend. I can't find much about it, but they're sort of... twisted monsters that roam the woods ""driven to consume sweet mortal flesh."""
14,16,DEAN,You think this is our Hot Lips?
14,16,SAM,"Could be. I mean, according to the lore, Kohonta get so starving, they spit up stomach acid."
14,16,DEAN,Mm. Gross.
14,16,SAM,"Yeah. If that is our monster, it's old... and... hungry."
14,16,FITZ,How much longer?
14,16,SARA,"Keep up, old man."
14,16,FITZ,What was that?
14,16,SARA,Nothing. It's just the wind.
14,16,FITZ,We should head back.
14,16,FITZ,Sara?
14,16,FITZ,"Sara, run!"
14,16,TOM,"Hey, did you know when some animals get a taste of people, that's all they'll want to hunt? I mean, I'm reading on here that tigers, even bears --"
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"Tom, you've got to stop."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Yeah. It was.
14,16,SHERIFF'S DEPUTY,"Sheriff, there's a... situation at Big Creek."
14,16,TOM,"It got somebody else, didn't it?"
14,16,SARA,But did -- did they find him?
14,16,DEAN,"No, not yet."
14,16,SAM,"Sara, what did you see out there?"
14,16,SARA,"There was this guy. I think...it was a guy. He looked like he was covered in something. And... he was whistling. I ran, but Fitz, he..."
14,16,SAM,Can you tell us exactly where you were when this thing attacked you?
14,16,SARA,I think... a few miles past the old Parker cabin.
14,16,DEAN,Parker?
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"Okay, wrap it up!"
14,16,DEPUTY,"Sheriff, we've got a search party out there."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Not anymore. You're bringing everybody in. Now.
14,16,DEAN,What's going on?
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,What does it look like? We're done here. I'm not wasting time and money hunting for a rabid coyote.
14,16,SAM,"Okay, Sheriff, this wasn't an animal attack."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Then what was it?
14,16,DEAN,"Look, if you want to pull your men out of there, that's fine. But we still need to get in there."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"It's not happening. Look, I don't care if you guys are the FBI. Nobody goes in those woods without my say-so. Understood?"
14,16,DEAN,Mm-hmm.
14,16,SAM,Hm.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Good.
14,16,DEAN,"Well, we should probably do what he says."
14,16,SAM,"Oh, yeah. Definitely."
14,16,STACY,I'm gonna fail. I'm gonna fail the SATs.
14,16,MAX,"No way. I mean, you get 400 points just for spelling your name right."
14,16,STACY,Mmm.
14,16,MAX,"So, I mean... you'll at least get that. Probably. Maybe."
14,16,STACY,Shut up!
14,16,MAX,It's not my fault you're so cute when you're angry.
14,16,ELIOT,"If you two are going to kiss, can you go to the other room?"
14,16,MAX,Myeh!
14,16,STACY,Hmm...
14,16,ELIOT,I'm trying to work here.
14,16,STACY,Okay. Chill.
14,16,STACY,Come in.
14,16,ELIOT,Jack. You came.
14,16,JACK,Yeah. You invited me.
14,16,STACY,Yeah. We know.
14,16,ELIOT,Are these --
14,16,JACK,Books. On monsters.
14,16,ELIOT,Awesome.
14,16,JACK,What's that?
14,16,MAX,Music?
14,16,JACK,I like The Who.
14,16,STACY,Who?
14,16,MAX,"Oh, my aunt listens to them. They're... old."
14,16,JACK,"Well, Dean says any music made after 1979 ""sucks ass."""
14,16,MAX,That's because Dean is also old.
14,16,STACY,Sit down.
14,16,JACK,What's the sat?
14,16,STACY,The...SAT's?
14,16,MAX,"You were homeschooled, huh?"
14,16,JACK,Uh...yes.
14,16,ELIOT,Whoa. Do demons really look like this?
14,16,JACK,"Uh... No. They don't have horns. They actually look like smoke, unless they've possessed a human. Then, they can look like me or you... or anybody."
14,16,STACY,Really?
14,16,ELIOT,And you've seen one before?
14,16,JACK,I've killed one.
14,16,MAX,"Yeah? [she chuckles, skeptical] How?"
14,16,MAX,So...it's made out of angels?
14,16,JACK,"Uh, no, it kills angels and demons."
14,16,ELIOT,Cool.
14,16,STACY,Hey! Unh-unh! You're not going to go swinging some giant knife around.
14,16,ELIOT,I was just gonna --
14,16,STACY,Remember that time you almost killed yourself with a Slinky?
14,16,ELIOT,I didn't.
14,16,STACY,He tried to eat it.
14,16,ELIOT,I was 3.
14,16,MAX,"So, how do you use it?"
14,16,JACK,"Well, there are standard hand-to-hand combat moves. Like a lightsaber. Or you can throw it, like... this."
14,16,MAX,Nice.
14,16,DEAN,That sheriff was definitely hiding something.
14,16,SAM,"Yeah, either that or he's scared. Oh, by the way, uh, ""Kohonta"" means ""whistler."""
14,16,DEAN,All right. How do we kill it?
14,16,SAM,"Well, here's the thing. The lore doesn't really specify."
14,16,DEAN,"Great. Well, my vote? Shotgun, head, done."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Drop your weapons!
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"You boys don't listen, do you? Told you. Stay out of these woods! I don't care if you're FBI."
14,16,SAM,All right. Sheriff. We're not FBI.
14,16,DEAN,"Does the word ""Kohonta"" mean anything to you?"
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,No.
14,16,DEAN,You're lyin'.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,I'm not. You're coming in with me. Move. Now!
14,16,DEAN,"Sorry, Sheriff."
14,16,MAX,Getting closer.
14,16,JACK,I-I'm just a little rusty.
14,16,MAX,Mm-hmm.
14,16,ELIOT,"It's cool if you can't do it, dude."
14,16,JACK,"I can do it, okay?"
14,16,JACK,Just... watch.
14,16,ELIOT,What...
14,16,STACY,The...
14,16,MAX,Hell?
14,16,JACK,Kinda.
14,16,JACK,Watch this.
14,16,MAX,Holy...
14,16,ELIOT,This is so cool.
14,16,STACY,Max?
14,16,JACK,Don't worry. You're safe. Look.
14,16,ELIOT,Whoa. Jack.
14,16,JACK,I can control it.
14,16,MAX,I don't care! Just stop!
14,16,ELIOT,Jack?
14,16,JACK,What?
14,16,MAX,"Seriously, Jack! Stop!"
14,16,MAX,Stacy!
14,16,JACK,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
14,16,MAX,Stacy!
14,16,ELIOT,"Oh, God! Oh, God!"
14,16,MAX,"(to Stacy) It's okay, it's okay. (to Eliot) E-Eliot, go call 911. (to Stacy again) It's okay. You stay with me, okay? Please."
14,16,JACK,I was in control. E-Everything was fine. She moved.
14,16,MAX,Get away from her!
14,16,MAX,Stacy. It's okay. I'm here. Okay? Okay? Stacy. Please.
14,16,JACK,I can fix this.
14,16,MAX,What are you doing?!
14,16,JACK,Trust me. Okay.
14,16,ELIOT,Stace?
14,16,STACY,How?
14,16,JACK,I-I fixed you.
14,16,ELIOT,Don't.
14,16,JACK,But she's okay. Everything's fine. Right?
14,16,MAX,No! Okay? Just...get away.
14,16,JACK,Eliot?
14,16,DEAN,We hunt things. Fight things and kill things people don't understand. So... Kohonta. Talk.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"Uh...  I-I... I didn't think it was real. The Kohonta was a tribal legend, an old story. I haven't heard about it since I was a kid. But then I s-saw it the night Barbara was killed."
14,16,SAM,Wait a second. So that's why you've been trying to keep people out of the woods?
14,16,DEAN,So what the hell is this thing?
14,16,SAM,And then?
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"Things went bad. There was a hard winter. Their oldest son, Henry, survived... but he did things."
14,16,DEAN,What kind of things? Like Donner Party?
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"Pretty much. They say that boy not only ate his family, they said he went... mad with hunger. He went after my people, and then when my tribe caught him, they...  Killing him would have been too easy. They wanted that boy to suffer. For his crimes against our people, crimes against nature. They cursed him. He's doomed to roam the woods... always starving. And if he didn't feed... his body would eat itself. The Kohonta aren't born. They're made."
14,16,DEAN,So they just let some flesh-eating freak loose?
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,They bound him to this forest. They marked the trees to keep folks away. But that was a long time ago.
14,16,SAM,"Yeah, people forget."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Even me.
14,16,DEAN,"Well, it's a good thing. Like I said, we hunt these things."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,What do you mean?
14,16,SAM,"Kohonta, werewolves, demons."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Those are real?
14,16,DEAN,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. And we kill 'em."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,You -- Just the two of you?
14,16,SAM,We know what we're doing.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"Do you? Look, if those monsters are out there, why don't you tell people? Give them -- well, us -- a chance to fight back?"
14,16,DEAN,Because telling people about this stuff -- they don't always believe. Your people tried to warn you about this whistling freak. Nobody bought it. Not even you.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"So? Just record them, put it on YouTube."
14,16,DEAN,Knowing about monsters and fighting 'em are two different things.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,So you make that choice for everybody? Imagine telling them. Imagine the lives you could save.
14,16,SAM,"No. No. It doesn't work like that. People die. Even when they know how to fight, people still die."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Tom.
14,16,TOM,I can't do this anymore.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Where are you?
14,16,TOM,Just listen. Whatever's out there... I just want you to know I'm going to find it... and kill it.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Tom! No! To--
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,He's alone out there. We gotta find him.
14,16,DEAN,"Okay, slow down."
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,"Look, I-I lied to him. I told him it was a coyote."
14,16,DEAN,"Listen. We're gonna help you protect your son, okay?"
14,16,Sam,We're not entirely sure how to kill this thing.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,I am. Look. The story says a silver blade through the heart.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Thomas! Thomas!
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Hey!
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Aaah!
14,16,DEAN,"Go! Go! (to the Kohonta, as he shines his flashlight on it and it squirms) Whoa. You don't like that, huh? Come on!"
14,16,DEAN,"Yeah. Come on, come on."
14,16,DEAN,Aaah!
14,16,DEAN,"Whoa. That was like full-on ""Raiders."""
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Tom. He's alive.
14,16,Paramedic,Easy.
14,16,TOM,D-Dad?
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,Thomas.
14,16,TOM,Did we get it? The coyote?
14,16,Paramedic,Okay...ready?
14,16,TOM,Yeah.
14,16,SHERIFF ROMERO,I didn't know what to tell him.
14,16,SAM,How about the truth? He's your son. He deserves the truth.
14,16,DEAN,"So, telling the kid -- you think that's the best idea?"
14,16,SAM,What? You don't?
14,16,DEAN,"It doesn't make his life any better, you know? Do what we always do. When in doubt, lie."
14,16,SAM,"Yeah, right. Like we did with Jack?"
14,16,DEAN,"I took care of it, okay? We took care of it."
14,16,DEAN,Jack said he was fine.
14,16,SAM,"Yeah. He's a kid. And when we were kids, how many times did we tell Dad that we were fine just to make him happy?"
14,16,DEAN,"Hey, kid. We're back. You still at it?"
14,16,JACK,Almost there. How was the Hunt?
14,16,DEAN,Oh. Uh...disgusting.
14,16,JACK,"Oh. Well, I got the supplies. Except for the beer. I didn't have ID."
14,16,DEAN,You have tons of IDs.
14,16,JACK,They're fake.
14,16,SAM,"Jack... listen. Dean and I, we -- we want to talk to you about your powers."
14,16,JACK,W-What about them?
14,16,DEAN,"This Hunt, we, uh... we didn't want you coming along because we didn't want you using them."
14,16,SAM,"Not yet. Not for now. You know, you just got 'em back, Jack. We want to make sure you're comfortable with them again before you..."
14,16,DEAN,"Before you go all X-Men. It was crappy of us not to tell you. You know, we were trying to be nice. 'Cause we care about you. But because we care about you, you deserve the truth."
14,16,SAM,You understand that? Jack?
14,16,JACK,I understand. I won't use my powers without permission. Promise.
14,16,DEAN,Great. And I guess I'll go get some beer.
14,16,SAM,"What about everything else? You good? I mean, anything happen while we were gone?"
14,16,JACK,No. Nothin'.
14,16,SAM,Good.

15,1,Sam,"Cas, is he here? C-C-Can you... Can you... ?"
15,1,Cas,I don't think so.
15,1,Dean,"So, what? Chuck throws friggin' zombies at us now?!"
15,1,Sam,"I don't know if they're zombies, Dean. I think... I think whenever the souls came up from Hell that they... they just..."
15,1,Deana,They what? Just jumped into the nearest body?
15,1,Sam,"I guess, yes."
15,1,Dean,Is that thing gonna hold?
15,1,Sam,"The doors are banded iron, so it... I hope."
15,1,Dean,"Chuck... He said, ""Welcome to the End."" What... What does that mean? Cas? Come on, man! Ideas! Can you smite our way out of here?"
15,1,Cas,"No. You saw them. I would be overwhelmed, Dean. I... I don't know. They... They're ghosts, technically. Maybe... Maybe we can burn their bones?"
15,1,Sam,"Burn their bones? Cas, their bodies could be anywhere."
15,1,Dean,"Great. So we go outside, we get ripped apart. We stay in here, w-what, starve to death?!"
15,1,Cas,"Well, I wouldn't starve."
15,1,Dean,"Well, good for you. Good. Son of a bitch. Chuck. Man, I knew it. I knew he would do something like this. He's always so squirrelly, you know, with the... with the... the robe and the beard and... the smile that's, like, half-nice, half ""I'm gonna rip your throat out."" [mocking] ""Oh, let me play you a song."" Ugh!"
15,1,Dean,What do you got? Sam.
15,1,Sam,"You guys, I think hear water. There must be a-a drainage pipe or something."

15,1,Sam,Jack? You're alive.
15,1,Cas,That's not Jack. That's a demon.
15,1,Sam,What?
15,1,Not!Jack,Yeah. Sorry about that.
15,1,Dean,How in the hell?
15,1,Not!Jack,"Look, I just got here, and, uh, I needed a body, so..."
15,1,Sam,So you're a demon.
15,1,Not!Jack,"Yeah. Look. I-I'd do the whole eyes thing, but, uh, yeah, no eyes."
15,1,Dean,You... What the hell are you doing?
15,1,Not!Jack,Blending.
15,1,Cas,Get out of him.
15,1,Not!Jack,"Uh, look, uh, I know it's weird. Okay? Uh, where do I start? Like at the first day of school. Uh, hi. Uh, my name is Belphegor. And, I'm, uh, here from..."
15,1,Belphegor,Ooh. Whoa.
15,1,Cas,I said get out of him.
15,1,Belphegor,Whoa. Whoa. Hey.
15,1,Cas,I'm not gonna ask again.
15,1,Belphegor,No. I can help. Okay? I can help.
15,1,Dean,Cas. Let him speak.
15,1,Cas,He's an abomination!
15,1,Belphegor,"You're an abomination with that stupid, dumb trench coat."
15,1,Dean,"Cas, Cas. Hey. Hey. We need the help."
15,1,Cas,He is defiling Jack's corpse!
15,1,Dean,"But if he can help... Jack's gone, alright? So let's listen to what the demon has to say. If we don't like what he says, then we stab him."
15,1,Sam,"Cas. Dean's right. Alright. So, we are..."
15,1,Belphegor,"The Winchesters. Uh, I know. I read the papers."
15,1,Dean,You have newspapers in Hell?
15,1,Belphegor,"Yeah, the Wi-Fi sucks. Anyway, I'm guessing this whole, uh, Hellmouth thing is kind of, uh, you?"
15,1,Cas,No. It was God.
15,1,Belphegor,"Yeah. Sure. [he laughs, but TFW remains stoic] Oh, you're serious."
15,1,Sam,It's a long story. It... It...
15,1,Belphegor,"Okay, okay. Look. I-I'm not some crossroad demon. I'm not even one of those black-eyed goons who crawled his way up here to eat, you know, virgins and puppies and, uh, virgin puppies. Look. Downstairs, I punch a clock. A soul comes in, I torment it. I-It's what I do."
15,1,Dean,What's your point?
15,1,Belphegor,"The point is, I like my job. I like Hell the way it is... or... or was. So, all those bad guys? You want them back where they came from, right? Well, me too. Okay? We're... We're twinsies, guys."
15,1,Cas,"Oh, we are not twinsies."
15,1,Sam,Can you fix this?
15,1,Belphegor,"Um, no, but I can get you out of here."
15,1,Dean,How?
15,1,Belphegor,"Ohh. Little spell. You know, nothing major. Alright. Uh... [he bends over and scoops up some dirt] 
Just need some graveyard dirt... and some, uh, angel blood."
15,1,Sam,Cas.
15,1,Belphegor,Huh? You're welcome.
15,1,Belphegor,"Hey, it worked. High five."
15,1,Cas,The spirits have been destroyed.
15,1,Belphegor,"No, I just, uh, blasted them out of those bodies. Yeah."
15,1,Dean,"So where are the ghosts, then?"
15,1,Girl 1,So... how's this?
15,1,Rachel,Ooh!
15,1,Girl 1,"Oh, my God. [she holds up her phone for Rachel to use the selfie camera as a make up mirror]"
15,1,Rachel,Alright.
15,1,Girl 1,"Oh, my God. That color looks so good on you."
15,1,Rachel,"I know, right?"
15,1,Girl 1,I'm trying these next.
15,1,Rachel,"Oh, okay. Oh, that's so cute. So, your mom just bought you this stuff?"
15,1,Girl 1,"Yeah. Since the divorce, she feels super guilty."
15,1,Rachel,Awesome. Divorce is awesome.
15,1,Girl 1,"I know, right?"
15,1,Rachel,Hm.
15,1,Girl 1,"Rachel, you should try this."
15,1,Girl 1,Rachel.
15,1,Belphegor,"I mean, come on. I look good."
15,1,Dean,Anything?
15,1,Sam,"No, not yet. I mean, the news, they didn't... It just... I'm not seeing anything about a-a worldwide zombie apocalypse."
15,1,Dean,So... Ghostpocalypse. Maybe it's just happening here.
15,1,Belphegor,"Yeah. For now. I mean, the souls gotta go somewhere, right?"
15,1,Sam,"Yeah, how many are we talking about, by the way? Souls?"
15,1,Belphegor,In Hell?
15,1,Sam,Yes.
15,1,Belphegor,"Two, three billion."
15,1,Dean,"Alright. Let's just stick to the plan, alright? We head back to the bunker, figure out how to close the rift."
15,1,Belphegor,Yeah. If you can.
15,1,Dean,"Well, you got a better idea?"
15,1,Belphegor,"I do not. But if you wanted to buy some time, you could always contain the ghosts."
15,1,Sam,Contain them how?
15,1,Belphegor,Magic.
15,1,Cas,And you just happen to know the right spell?
15,1,Belphegor,Lucky you.
15,1,Dean,"What do you mean by ""contain""?"
15,1,Belphegor,"Imagine a salt circle a mile wide. No ghosts get in, no ghosts get out."
15,1,Sam,Yeah. Great. Okay.
15,1,Cas,"No. That town... Harlan, Kansas... is less than a mile from the cemetery."
15,1,Dean,Then we get everybody out.
15,1,Cas,How?
15,1,Dean,We lie.
15,1,Sam,You see that? Pull over.
15,1,Dean,There's no body.
15,1,Dean,This look familiar to you?
15,1,Sam,Yeah. Looks like a woman in white.
15,1,Dean,Exactly.
15,1,Dean,Dude. We sent her to Hell years ago.
15,1,Sam,"Yeah, but she could be back."
15,1,Dean,"Well, if she's back, then they're all back. Every last one that we ever killed."
15,1,Sam,Let's go.
15,1,Mother,Go in the garage. Okay... Okay. Okay.
15,1,Gacy Clown,I'm coming for you!
15,1,Mother,"Okay. Stay here, baby. Okay? Stay here? You'll be okay? Stay here."
15,1,Gacy,"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
15,1,Mother,"Ahh... Help! Please help us! Please!  Please, please, help us! Help! Help!"
15,1,Gacy,Come play with me!
15,1,Mother,Please help. Please...
15,1,Mother,"Okay. Uh, it's okay. We're gonna be okay. Come on. Let's go this way."
15,1,Gacy,I know where you are!
15,1,Sheriff,You don't have to move the dang tree. Just move the sign. All the problems gone.
15,1,Sam,Excuse me. FBI.
15,1,Sheriff,How can I help you?
15,1,Dean,"We can handle the evac, so why don't you grab Crowley Jr. here whatever he needs for his spell?"
15,1,Cas,No.
15,1,Dean,What?
15,1,Cas,"Dean, I can't. I-I... I can't even look at him. Um... I..."
15,1,Sheriff,"Well, I-I... Benzene?"
15,1,Sam,The pipeline outside town. It sprung a leak.
15,1,Sheriff,W-What pipeline?
15,1,Sam,"Sheriff, listen. The longer we stand here talking about it, the more people are gonna get sick. Now, the EPA is on its way, but we need to clear these people out ASAP."
15,1,Sheriff,"Well, I suppose we could move folks up to the high school."
15,1,Cas,Where is that?
15,1,Sheriff,About five miles up 281.
15,1,Cas,"Well, that's far enough."
15,1,Sam,Great. Get these people on the move. We'll go house-to-house. Come on.
15,1,Belphegor,"Uh, what's that?"
15,1,Dean,Don't worry about it.
15,1,Belphegor,"Okay. Cool. So, people are, like, crazy good-looking now, eh?"
15,1,Dean,What?
15,1,Belphegor,"I mean, the last time I was on Earth, I mean, I was human. Ah, it was a while ago. I mean, but, you know, we were all worshipping this giant rock that looked like a huge penis, and... Anyway, folks back then, you know? Had a lot of humps. I mean, a lot. Look at 'em now. I mean, look at you. I mean, you're, uh, you know, gorgeous."
15,1,Dean,What? Okay. When are you gonna get out of that body?
15,1,Belphegor,"Eh, when I find another one. I mean, I would've jumped at the cemetery, but all those meat suits were a little too, uh, you know, wormy. Difficult to blend, if you will. Yeah. So, uh... who was... he, anyway?"
15,1,Dean,He was our kid. Kinda.
15,1,Belphegor,Oh. Sorry.
15,1,Dean,"Alright. So, what do you need for this spell?"
15,1,Belphegor,"You know, nothing much. Big bag of salt."
15,1,Dean,Easy.
15,1,Belphegor,And a... And a human heart.
15,1,Sam,"Alright. I go left. You go right. See anybody, get 'em out. See a ghost, hit it with the rock salt."
15,1,Sam,Hello?
15,1,Cas,Hello?! Hello?
15,1,Sam,Hello? Anybody in here?
15,1,Mother,Here! Here. Up here.
15,1,Mother,"Oh, God. Thank God. Dead. They're all dead."
15,1,Sam,"I know. I know. Shh. Just... I'm gonna get you out of here, alright? [to the little girl] Hey. You're gonna be okay, alright? Everything's gonna be fine."
15,1,Cas,Sam.
15,1,Sheriff,"Just head to the gym! I'll be right behind you! Move those people! Travis, I told you, you gotta get out of the chapel."
15,1,Belphegor,"What? Oh. No. I-I mean, uh... – I'm a fan."
15,1,Dean,Excuse me?
15,1,Belphegor,"Yeah, I-I didn't want to say it in front of the other guys, but when you were in Hell, with Alastair, I, uh... I got a chance to watch you work. And, I mean, the things you did to those people, I mean, it wasn't torture. It was, um... It was art."
15,1,Dean,"Yeah, but that was a long time ago."
15,1,Belphegor,Depends how you look at it.
15,1,Dean,"So, with all this going on, what's it like down there?"
15,1,Belphegor,In Hell?
15,1,Dean,Yeah.
15,1,Belphegor,"You ever seen an ant hill when it's, like, set on fire? Okay, well, there we were, minding our own business, you know, flaying people for eternity, like you do, right? And then every door in Hell just sprang open all at once. You know? Souls got out. Sky cracked. And, uh, boom, ta-da, you know?"
15,1,Dean,Wait. Every door? Even the Cage?
15,1,Belphegor,"Yeah, even the Cage."
15,1,Dean,And Michael?
15,1,Belphegor,"Well, last I heard, he was just sittin' there. Yeah, but if he got out, I mean... Ugh. I mean... he wouldn't hold a grudge, right?"
15,1,Cas,Stay still.
15,1,Mother,H-How?
15,1,Castiel,I'm an angel.
15,1,Mother,And the clown was...
15,1,Sam,A ghost.
15,1,Mother,And you're...?
15,1,Sam,Just a guy.
15,1,Cas,Sam?
15,1,Sam,"Yeah, I'm good. Just... Like, when I shot God..."
15,1,Mother,I'm sorry. When you shot God?
15,1,Cas,It's a long story.
15,1,Sam,It's nothing. It's fine. It's just...
15,1,Cas,Sam. Let me see.
15,1,Dean,"Sammy, please."
15,1,Sam,Did you fix it?
15,1,Cas,No. I can't. There's... There's an energy in that wound that's... I never felt that before.
15,1,Sam,"Well, like I said, it's fine."
15,1,Cas,Sam.
15,1,Sam,Sheriff?
15,1,Sam,"Hey, uh, Agent. I'm, uh... I'm doing a final sweep, but looks like I got everybody."
15,1,Sam,Okay. Great. Just head to the school.  I'll meet you there.
15,1,Sheriff,Copy that.
15,1,Sheriff,Ma'am? Ma'am? You okay?
15,1,Belphegor,So... about that heart.
15,1,Dean,Working on it. I'm thinking maybe we hit the morgue.
15,1,Belphegor,"Hmm. Fresh, it'd be... it would be better."
15,1,Belphegor,Hmm. Hm. Cool.
15,1,Dean,Son of a bitch.
15,1,Belphegor,Yeah. Yeah. Poor guy.
15,1,Dean,Whoa!
15,1,Belphegor,"Ahh. Well, got a heart."
15,1,Mother,"Baby, what... what are you doing? We got to go."
15,1,Dean,We need to move. Now.
15,1,Constance,"I remember you. You took me home. [she attacks Dean, flinging him into a dumpster]"
15,1,Cas,It's just one ghost. [to the mother and girl] It's okay. Stay back.
15,1,Cas,Just three.
15,1,Belphegor,"Oh, hey. Look, okay? I barely even... I barely even know this guy, okay?"
15,1,Cas,You shot me.
15,1,Belphegor,"Hey, hey. Bad ghost. Bad. No. [Constance slashes his hand]"
15,1,Dean,"Hey, Casper. [he hits her with a metal rod and she disappears]"
15,1,Dean,Spell. Now. Let's get the salt.
15,1,Mother,Come on. Come...
15,1,[alley,"dean pours a large bag of salt into a mound, and Belphegor places the heart on top]"
15,1,Dean,We good?
15,1,Belphegor,We're good.
15,1,Belphegor,Animi... infernorum... spiritus abyssi surrecti... defigo... vos intra confinia.
15,1,Mother,Come on.
15,1,Sam,Hey. It's okay.
15,1,Belphegor: Vinciamni!,"[he slams his hand on the ground and a circle of red energy rushes out from the heart, through town, past Sam and Cas, forming an invisible wall at the edge]"
15,1,Sam,You alright? Okay.
15,1,Mother,Okay.
15,1,Cas,Is that... ?
15,1,Sam,The spell. Alright. Let's go. Let's go.
15,1,Cas,Sam!
15,1,Cas,Sam...
15,1,Sam,Go!
15,1,Cas,Come on.
15,1,Cas,Sam!
15,1,Sam,Shut up. Come on. Let's go.
15,1,Mother,"So, what now?"
15,1,Sam,Okay. You two go inside. We'll take care of the town.
15,1,Dean,And maybe don't tell anybody about the whole ghost thing.
15,1,Cas,Or the angel thing.
15,1,Sam,"Yeah, that... that might freak them out."
15,1,Belphegor,"Uh, ""might""?"
15,1,Sam,I got 'em. Here. Watch your step. Okay.
15,1,Cas,"Yes, but..."
15,1,Dean,Good.
15,1,Belphegor,Wow! Awkward. Wanna talk about it or... ? [Cas walks away] Is that a no? That's a no.
15,1,Dean,How are the locals?
15,1,Sam,"They're asking a lot of questions about the evacuation. And, by the way, when this ""gas leak"" thing gets out, we have one, maybe two days before the real FBI shows up."
15,1,Dean,"Yeah, no, I figured."
15,1,Sam,So what do we do now?
15,1,Dean,Right now we get you fixed up.
15,1,Sam,We what?
15,1,Dean,"Chuck got shot and you got shot, right?"
15,1,Sam,I'm fine.
15,1,Dean,"No, no, no. Come on. We've been going nonstop. Let me see it. [Dean examines Sam's shoulder] There's no exit wound."
15,1,Sam,I know.
15,1,Dean,How bad does it hurt?
15,1,Sam,"A little, not much."
15,1,Dean,"Okay. Hey, do you remember when we were little? What I would do to distract you whenever I'd rip off a Band-Aid or something like that?"
15,1,Sam,Yeah. You'd tell some stupid joke.
15,1,Dean,"Yeah. Knock, knock. Come on. Knock, knock."
15,1,Sam,Who's... [Dean cleans the wound with alcohol before Sam finishes]
15,1,Dean,Still got it.
15,1,Sam,"Yeah. So, when Chuck... God... said ""This is the End,"" I guess this is what he meant."
15,1,Dean,"Yeah, well. Screw him. He's been playing us this entire time. Alright."
15,1,Sam,No.
15,1,Dean,"Just when we thought we had a choice. You know, whenever we thought we had free will. We were just rats in a maze. Sure, we could go left. Sure, we could go right. But we were still in the damn maze. Just makes you think, if all of it... you know, everything that we've done... What did it even mean?"
15,1,Sam,It meant a lot. We still saved people.
15,1,Dean,"Yeah, but what for? You know? Just so he could throw another End of the World at us and then sit back and chug popcorn?"
15,1,Sam,"Maybe. Yeah, maybe. But... now he's gone."
15,1,Dean,You think?
15,1,Sam,"That's what he does. He gets bored and... and... and... and pulls the ripcord. I mean, that's what he did with Apocalypse World and... and probably with all of them. He moves on, starts another story. But you know what? Good. 'Cause if he bailed, it's just us. For the first time. It's just us."
15,1,Dean,And about three billion ghosts.
15,1,Sam,"Yeah, well, what's one more Apocalypse, right? But, seriously, if we win... When we win this, God's gone. Hm. There's no one to screw with us. There's no more maze. It's just us. And we're free."
15,1,Dean,So you and me versus every soul in Hell? I like those odds.
15,1,Sam,"Yeah, me too."
15,1,Dean,"Well, you know what that means. We got work to do."
15,2,CHUCK,This isn't how the story is supposed to end.
15,2,DEAN,"This isn't just a story. It's our lives! So God or no God, you go to Hell."
15,2,CHUCK,Fine! [snaps his fingers and Jack dies]
15,2,CHUCK,Story's over. Welcome to The End.
15,2,DEAN,What the hell is happening?!
15,2,CASTIEL,Souls from Hell.
15,2,CASTIEL,That's not Jack. That's a demon.
15,2,DEAN,How in the hell?
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Uh, hi. Uh, my name is Belphegor."
15,2,CASTIEL,I said get out of him.
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"No. I can help. If you wanted to buy some time, you could always contain the ghosts."
15,2,SAM,Contain them how?
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Imagine a salt circle a mile wide. No ghosts get in, no ghosts get out."
15,2,SAM,Let's go.
15,2,NAN,Ugh.
15,2,NAN,"Oh. Rob. You didn't evacuate. And you seem to be breathing fine. You ask me, this whole ""benzine leak"" sounds phony. Everyone's been camped out at the high school for two days. I just snuck back to get Debbie's allergy meds. All this going on, and you know what she's worried out? That they'll cancel the school spelling bee. She studied her butt off for it. Do you, uh... Do you... Do you think they'll cancel the spelling bee? Rob? Rob?"
15,2,GHOST,Disembowel. D-i-s-e-m-b-o-w-e-l. Disembowel.
15,2,CASTIEL,"I just don't know how much longer we can control them. I don't think they're buying the benzine story. I think... One man told me his wife, she's gone missing and..."
15,2,SAM,"Wait, wait. What? Who?"
15,2,CASTIEL,He said her name was Nan.
15,2,SAM,"Alright, we'll find her. [to another hunter on the scene] Will you tell the Hunters in the zone to keep an eye out?"
15,2,HUNTER,Got it.
15,2,SAM,Thank you. [to Cas] Give me a minute.
15,2,SAM,"C-Can I have your attention? 'Scuse me! Um, can I have... Excuse me! Can I have your attention, please? Great. First off, we expect to have you back in your homes shortly. Uh, EPA techs will be here tomorrow to determine the source of the elevated benzine levels and how to properly respond. In the meantime, it is essential you stay out of the quarantine zone until it's safe. Thanks. Okay. Any questions?"
15,2,DEAN,"Too much EMF. You can still see 'em, right?"
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Yeah, there were some over there, but they spotted us and left. Not their favorite."
15,2,DEAN,"So you were a dick to 'em in Hell, huh?"
15,2,BELPHEGOR,No. I did my job. It's Hell. It's not a day spa.
15,2,DEAN,Can't believe I've teamed up with a demon again. Think I'd know better by now.
15,2,BELPHEGOR,Teaming up with a Hunter. I could say the same.
15,2,DEAN,Why are you helping?
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Yeah. Eh, nice shot."
15,2,DEAN,"Well, he hit the warding. At least that's still holding."
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Mm. For now. I mean, the spell is... it's not gonna last forever, and these aren't your normal ghosty-ghosts, you know. They're more dangerous."
15,2,DEAN,Dangerous how?
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Well, I mean, that guy you just shot, it's Francis Tumblety."
15,2,DEAN,Who?
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Uh, ""Jack the Ripper""."
15,2,DEAN,Cool.
15,2,DAVE,"I did ask 'em again, Andy, and it is the same old runaround. ""Doing everything they can""."
15,2,ANDY,Right.
15,2,SHERRI,I just... What can we do?
15,2,DAVE,"I don't know. There's somethin' goin' on in this town, okay? And it ain't the ""benzine"". Nan went out. She never came back. We're gonna get in there, and we're gonna find her."
15,2,ANDY,They got guys patrolling the town... guys with guns.
15,2,DAVE,"There's not enough of 'em. The area's too big. Hey, we'll find a way."
15,2,TUMBLETY,Order. I will have order. Shut. Up!
15,2,GHOST,Oh.
15,2,TUMBLETY,"I-I know you're all wondering why we were spit out of Hell and what's going on. Well, I have answers. It appears we were liberated by cataclysm at the hands of... Ready? ... God, Himself. Yes. I overheard it from the louts who hold us captive... Hunters."
15,2,WOMAN,How do you know they're Hunters?
15,2,TUMBLETY,"I was just shot with rock salt. Wild guess. Further, the Hunters are being abetted by demons. I personally had an encounter with none other than Belphegor."
15,2,WOMAN,"What do you suggest... ""Doctor?"""
15,2,TUMBLETY,Reach out to all the cowards who are hiding in the shadows and tell them to stand with us. Our strength is in numbers. We will find a way out of here.
15,2,MAN,But the warding...
15,2,TUMBLETY,"Warding is a door. Doors have locks. Locks have keys, or they can be forced. But until we find a way, we make it as ugly as possible for those who stand guard."
15,2,HUNTER,"Yeah, I just want to make sure we're clear over there."
15,2,CASTIEL,"I just think we need to tell the family something. I mean, we found his wife's body."
15,2,SAM,"Cas, we will. When we can."
15,2,CASTIEL,When we can?
15,2,SAM,"Cas, we have people outside that door who are barely keeping it together. We start talking murder..."
15,2,ROWENA,Knock knock! Am I interrupting something juicy?
15,2,SAM,"No. Rowena, thanks for coming."
15,2,ROWENA,Samuel. Castiel. What? A town full of ghosts! Messy even by Winchester standards.
15,2,SAM,We're hoping you can help.
15,2,ROWENA,Can you boys do nothing on your own? Very well. What do you want?
15,2,SAM,Remember a couple years ago when we were trying to get rid of Amara?
15,2,ROWENA,"God's sister, aye.  Sticky business, that."
15,2,SAM,Hmm.
15,2,CASTIEL,You made a crystalline device... a bomb.
15,2,ROWENA,You want to blow up the ghosts?
15,2,SAM,"No. No. No, no. But the ""bomb"" was powered by souls. Souls that were sucked into it."
15,2,ROWENA,Ah... and ghosts are nothing but souls. I hope you're not thinking...
15,2,SAM,Trap them in a crystal...
15,2,ROWENA,"Samuel, no! That was so difficult. It took everything I had."
15,2,SAM,Yeah. Rowena...
15,2,JULES,Sam. We got a situation.
15,2,SAM,"Hey, what's going on?"
15,2,DEAN,Guy's wife disappeared. I guess he came back in here looking for her.
15,2,SAM,"Alright. Hey, uh, guys.What's happening? Uh, we're gonna have to ask you to leave this area and head back to the school."
15,2,DEAN,"Sam, they're possessed."
15,2,TUMBLETY,Clear the way. We're leaving. Open the warding. Now.
15,2,DEAN,Obviously that's not gonna happen.
15,2,TUMBLETY,"We're not in the mood to argue. [he gestures at the possessed man, who begins to writhe in pain] His insides are being torn apart by the spirit possessing him. So sad."
15,2,TUMBLETY,That's far enough. Stop. The warding. Now!
15,2,KETCH,"Hello, lads."
15,2,SAM,"Okay. Ketch, how are you here?"
15,2,KETCH,"Oh, I-I just happened to be in the area when you sent out word looking for help with your little... situation."
15,2,ROWENA,Oh.
15,2,KETCH,Eh?
15,2,DEAN,"Right, well. That's... Lucky us. [he points at Ketch's strange gun] What is that?"
15,2,KETCH,"Uh, it fires iron flakes, expelling ghosts without harm to the possessed victim, courtesy of the British Men of Letters. I lifted it along with a few other... toys when I left."
15,2,ROWENA,[to Dean] Dear? I'd prefer a wee shot of Scotch... if you have it handy.
15,2,KETCH,"Ah, a witch with fine taste. Rowena, I do hope there's no hard feelings still after our initial introduction. My people were holding you prisoner and..."
15,2,ROWENA,"But you let me escape, and I haven't forgotten."
15,2,KETCH,Hmm.
15,2,DEAN,Rowena's working on a little gadget that vacuums up souls.
15,2,KETCH,Oh. Fascinating.
15,2,ROWENA,It's what I do.
15,2,SAM,"Yeah, problem is... ghosts keep coming and the warding we put up is only gonna last so long, so... all hands on deck."
15,2,KETCH,Right.
15,2,BELPHEGOR,Streets are quiet. Which just means they're planning their next move.
15,2,KETCH,Jack?
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Um, no. I get that a lot."
15,2,KETCH,"So, Jack is..."
15,2,SAM,Dead. Jack is dead.
15,2,DEAN,Killed by God. I guess kid got under His skin.
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"And now I'm under Jack's. Yeah, literally. Belphegor's the name."
15,2,KETCH,You're Belphegor? And you're assisting Sam and Dean with this whole ghost business? This is awkward.
15,2,DEAN,What?
15,2,KETCH,"Well, truth be told, in my current employment as a freelance contractor, I was asked to, um, assassinate the demon Belphegor."
15,2,SAM,You're not here to help?
15,2,KETCH,"Well, I certainly am now. I was told that Belphegor was a monstrous threat to humanity. Apparently not correct, yes, hmm?"
15,2,SAM,Who told you that?
15,2,KETCH,An attractive female demon named...
15,2,BELPHEGOR,Ardat.
15,2,KETCH,She doesn't like you.
15,2,SAM,"Point is... Don't kill him, alright? We need him."
15,2,DEAN,For now.
15,2,AMARA,"Hmm. Nice touch, Kimiko. Feel free to go deeper. [Kimiko's hands are replaced by Chuck's who presses harder on Amara's temples] Oh, oh, maybe not that deep. [Amara opens her eyes and sees Chuck, and jumps away] Whoa! You!"
15,2,CHUCK,"Hi, sis."
15,2,AMARA,"Did you smite my masseuse? [Chuck shrugs] Oh, my... We agreed to give each other space."
15,2,CHUCK,"I know. I'm totally on board with that. Truly, I am. I just felt like, you know, checking in. We are family. You're the darkness. I'm the light. So, how about the ""Game of Thrones"" ending? Pretty great, right?"
15,2,AMARA,Small talk? Really? Why are you here?
15,2,ANDY,First Nan went missing. Now Dave and Sheri.
15,2,CASTIEL,We are looking for them everywhere.
15,2,ANDY,You said you'd keep us safe.
15,2,DEAN,This is quite the list of ingredients. Hope you got an Amazon account.
15,2,ROWENA,"Prime. The trap requires a tricky bit of spellery. I need what I need. Even then, no guarantee."
15,2,DEAN,"Well, you're the mad scientist."
15,2,ROWENA,"So, uh, tell me about Arthur Ketch."
15,2,DEAN,Seems like you've met.
15,2,ROWENA,"That was more of a torturer-torturee relationship. Fun, but I didn't really get to know him."
15,2,DEAN,"Rowena, we have ourselves a crisis on our hands, okay? Find yourself another boy toy. You don't want to get involved with Ketch."
15,2,ROWENA,Don't I?
15,2,DEAN,Hey.
15,2,CASTIEL,"Yeah, hey. Dean, I recognize that I... dropped the puck."
15,2,DEAN,"Ball. It's, uh... It's ""dropped the ball""."
15,2,CASTIEL,"Ball, right. I didn't tell you about Jack, and then after what happened with your mother..."
15,2,DEAN,Don't.
15,2,CASTIEL,You're angry.
15,2,DEAN,"Yes, I am angry. At everything. All of it."
15,2,CASTIEL,All of it?
15,2,DEAN,"This mess... all the messes. It turns out that we're just hamsters running in a wheel our whole lives. What do we have to show for it, huh? Tell me you don't feel conned. God's been lying to you, Cas, forever. You bought into the biggest scam in history."
15,2,CASTIEL,You don't think I'm angry? After what Chuck did? After what he took from me? He killed Jack. But that doesn't mean it was all a lie.
15,2,DEAN,Really?
15,2,CASTIEL,"Chuck is all-knowing. He knew the truth, he... he just kept it to himself."
15,2,DEAN,"Well, now that his cover's blown, everything that we've done is for what? Nothing?"
15,2,CASTIEL,"Even if we didn't know that all of the challenges that we face were born of Chuck's machinations, how would we describe it all? We'd call it ""life"". Because that's precisely what life is. It's an obstacle course, and maybe Chuck designed the obstacles, but we ran our own race. We made our own moves. And mostly, we did well with that."
15,2,DEAN,"Did we? I'll tell you what we do know. Nothing about our lives is real. Everything that we've lost, everything that we are is because of Chuck. So maybe you can stick your head back in the sand, maybe you can pretend that we actually had a choice. I can't."
15,2,CASTIEL,"Dean. You asked, ""What about all of this is real?"" We are."
15,2,DEAN,"Oh, here. Almost forgot. You're gonna wanna wear this."
15,2,KETCH,Um... not really... me.
15,2,DEAN,Neither is possession. It's iron. Put it on.
15,2,KETCH,"Mm-hmm. So, based on what you're telling me, the enemy is actually... God?"
15,2,DEAN,"Yeah, go figure. You guys didn't come up with a cool weapon for Him, did you?"
15,2,KETCH,No. God was always more... theoretical... more rumor than fact.
15,2,DEAN,Hmm.
15,2,KETCH,"So, um... Tell me about the witch."
15,2,DEAN,"Aw, come on. What is it with you two?"
15,2,KETCH,What?
15,2,DEAN,Trouble. Two Hunters haven't checked in.
15,2,DEAN,That's not good. Ben? Frankie?
15,2,KEVIN,Stop it! Stop! Get out. Now!
15,2,DEAN,Kevin?
15,2,DEAN,I don't believe it.
15,2,KEVIN,"Yeah, I was gonna meet up with you guys sooner, but I... kinda just got here. [to Ketch] Kevin Tran. Former prophet..."
15,2,KETCH,"Arthur Ketch, uh... former assassin. Mostly."
15,2,DEAN,What are you... What are you even doin' here? You're supposed to be in Heaven.
15,2,KEVIN,"Yeah, not so much."
15,2,DEAN,Chuck said he was sending you to Heaven.
15,2,KEVIN,"Yeah, what he said, not what he did."
15,2,KETCH,"Wait, he lied? For what? Kicks?"
15,2,DEAN,"Turns out, God's a dick. Look, it doesn't matter. We are going to get you to Heaven, okay? Right after we shove all these ghosts back down."
15,2,KETCH,At least the town is warded.
15,2,KEVIN,"Yeah, but it's fading. I can feel it."
15,2,KETCH,"So, the others feel it, as well?"
15,2,KEVIN,"Uh, not sure. But if they do, you've got a lot of problems."
15,2,DEAN,"What, your... your... your pals know that you, me, and Sam have history? I mean, you did just yell at 'em and saved my ass."
15,2,KEVIN,"I yell at 'em all the time. They take it. Since God himself cast me down, I've got kind of a bad-boy rep."
15,2,DEAN,Oh. That means you can mingle.
15,2,CHUCK,I called room service like an hour ago. How long's a burger take?
15,2,CHUCK,"You know... That, uh... little retreat of ours, it taught me how priceless our relationship is. And, you know, since I'm on an extended break from my omniscient benevolence, why not use the time to deepen what we have? So, you know, why not drop by another dimension? Check it out. Maybe start a new species? Huh? You know? A family project. Sound good?"
15,2,AMARA,I'm... fine. I am running a hot streak in craps. I like Reno. Everyone here is so not... you.
15,2,AMARA,Interesting. What... is it?
15,2,CHUCK,I don't know.
15,2,AMARA,You need me.
15,2,CHUCK,"Of course I need you, Amara. You're my big sis."
15,2,AMARA,"You've never needed me. What... is going on? Oh. Oh, there it is... Hm. Your shoulder."
15,2,CHUCK,Ow!
15,2,AMARA,Something happened. You're not complete. You're not at full strength. And you're afraid.
15,2,SAM,"Okay, look, it's great to have Kevin around... even Ghost Kevin... but do you think it's safe having him do what he's doing?"
15,2,DEAN,"No. No. I mean, none of this is safe for any of us, but if he can give us some information, you know..."
15,2,DEAN,Would you stop sneaking up on us?
15,2,SAM,"Hey, we just heard from a reliable source that the warding is fading."
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Yeah. Sure, sure. Like... Like I said it would. I guess I just assumed you two pros woulda wrapped it up by now. What can I say? Goofy optimist."
15,2,DEAN,"Okay, meanwhile, we're gonna need you to charge her back up."
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Oh... Yeah, if only. Sorry, guys. It was a one-time thing."
15,2,SAM,"Well, Kevin says the ghosts may sense its weakness."
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Oh, ""Kevin says""? Kevin Tran? Whiny Kevin Tran? Ugh. Typical millennial."
15,2,DEAN,"Kevin's not even supposed to be in Hell, okay, so when this is all over, we're gonna send him up in Heaven where he belongs."
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Yeah, yeah, not gonna happen. Souls cast down to Hell? That's the end of it. Heaven can't take 'em."
15,2,SAM,That's not true. Our dad made it to Heaven after he was in Hell.
15,2,DEAN,And Bobby Singer.
15,2,BELPHEGOR,So God made an exception. Didn't he used to like you two? Just saying. Without the big guy... them's the rules.
15,2,DEAN,Still with the shoulder?
15,2,SAM,I'm okay. It's getting better.
15,2,MAN,I felt it.
15,2,TUMBLETY,"Yes, yes, I felt it, too. The warding that surrounds us is indeed beginning to falter."
15,2,MAN,"So, we just hang loose for a while, then when it fails, we just stroll outta here."
15,2,TUMBLETY,"No, I say we seize the moment. Use our collective strength. We find the most vulnerable point in the warding, mass our power, and break through now. Then back to all the fun that sent us to Hell in the first place."
15,2,WOMAN,We can't be the only ones noticing the wall's got issues. The Hunters will be workin' overtime to send us back.
15,2,TUMBLETY,"What have we here? Well, look who Hell just coughed up. Kevin Tran."
15,2,KEVIN,"Yeah, so what? Answer the lady. What do we do about the Hunters?"
15,2,TUMBLETY,"Well, you tell me, Kevin. Aren't you privy to their plans?"
15,2,KEVIN,"Who, me? Are you kidding?"
15,2,TUMBLETY,"In Hell, I was never as impressed by you as my more gullible colleagues. I've heard demons say that in life, you were quite closely connected to the Hunters. To the Winchesters, in particular. Oh, you know how the Hellspawn are. All they talk about is Sam and Dean, Sam and Dean..."
15,2,KEVIN,Okay. I've had enough of this.
15,2,MAN,Mnh.
15,2,ROWENA,"I do like a left-brained man. Logic, cause and effect, calculations... very butch. It does, however, lack the more nuanced perspective of... the right brain."
15,2,KETCH,"The, um... voodoo, booga-booga perspective."
15,2,ROWENA,One might welcome the coupling of both.
15,2,KETCH,Ah.
15,2,ROWENA,"The dominating, analytical enforcer... you... and the pulsating, throbbing firebrand... me."
15,2,KETCH,Hmm.
15,2,KETCH,"Well, in the, um... spirit of... coupling... ... may I suggest a shortcut to your alchemy, one we used at the, um, British Men of Letters?"
15,2,ROWENA,Mm.
15,2,KETCH,Right. Mm.
15,2,ROWENA,Mm. Oh!
15,2,KETCH,I think you'll find you can skip the next two steps. The power of science.
15,2,ROWENA,"But... if we were to marry the power of science with the power of magic, you might find we had a situation that was highly explosive."
15,2,ROWENA,"Yes, Dean, what? Aye, it's almost there. But you can't rush these things. Fine, fine."
15,2,TUMBLETY,Rowena. Delicious to see you again.
15,2,ROWENA,Francis Tumblety! You're an unfaithful dog.
15,2,TUMBLETY,Oh? And you're Mary Poppins? You know I always thought of you as special. I gutted my other dates.
15,2,ROWENA,"I told you centuries back, our liaison was finito, so let me pass."
15,2,TUMBLETY,"What's in the bag, Red? Oh, don't tell me. You're working with the Hunters now? How sad. But perhaps there's a silver lining. You can deliver a message. Tell the Winchesters we have their boy, and we want to talk. 5879 Maple. We'll be waiting."
15,2,KETCH,You there! Charm School. [to Rowena] Run.
15,2,ROWENA,I got here as quick as I could. Mr. Ketch and I were attacked by ghosts. He may still be fightin' them.
15,2,SAM,Are you okay?
15,2,ROWENA,He... Francis said they have your boy.
15,2,DEAN,Kevin?
15,2,DEAN,Did you bring the soul catcher?
15,2,SAM,Is that what you're calling it?
15,2,DEAN,I like soul catcher.
15,2,ROWENA,"Whatever. There's been such a fuss, there's no telling if it works."
15,2,DEAN,"Well, if it doesn't, nice knowin' all of you."
15,2,TUMBLETY,The Messrs. Winchester. I hope this encounter's more productive than the last one.
15,2,SAM,You said you wanna talk.
15,2,TUMBLETY,Indeed. The terms are quite simple. You shut down the warding. I won't devour Kevin whole.
15,2,DEAN,"Well, here's our offer. You go to Hell."
15,2,TUMBLETY,Not what it's cracked up to be.
15,2,TUMBLETY,"Well, boys, what's it gonna be?"
15,2,ROWENA,Capare!
15,2,KEVIN,Thanks. I think my badass days in Hell may be over.
15,2,DEAN,"Yeah, looks like. Nice work, Rowena."
15,2,ROWENA,"Oh, it's not as powerful as the first one. A few ghosts at a time, I'm afraid. A lot of them got away."
15,2,SAM,So what now?
15,2,KEVIN,"They have a backup plan... They know that the warding's been fading. They think if they mass all the ghosts at its weakest point, they'll be able to bust out."
15,2,DEAN,"Well, where's its weakest point?"
15,2,BELPHEGOR,So... not good.
15,2,DEAN,You can see 'em. How many of 'em are there?
15,2,BELPHEGOR,100 at least. More keep coming.
15,2,KETCH,Easy. It's just me.
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Yeah, that's not gonna work. There... There's too many of them."
15,2,ROWENA,Capare!
15,2,BELPHEGOR,It's working.
15,2,ROWENA,Capare!
15,2,DEAN,Ketch?
15,2,DEAN,Son of a bitch.
15,2,KETCH,"Oh, Dean. Did you run out? Wouldn't matter anyway. [to Rowena] And thank you. Thank you so very much."
15,2,ROWENA,Francis...
15,2,KETCH/TUMBLETY,"The thing about souls is... they're almost pure power, so even with the few trapped inside your little gizmo here, I am in possession of a massively powerful weapon, one which I will happily use to blow open that warding."
15,2,ROWENA,Capare! Capare!
15,2,CASTIEL,"I tried to heal him, but it didn't work. I don't know why."
15,2,SAM,"You're probably just tired, Cas. We all are."
15,2,DEAN,They're gonna get you fixed up. Sorry about the whole iron bullets. There just didn't seem to be another way.
15,2,KETCH,"Oh, admit it. You've killed me once. You've been itching to do it again."
15,2,DEAN,"Well, there's that. Take care, man."
15,2,DEAN,Hey.
15,2,SAM,Kevin said he wants to leave.
15,2,DEAN,"""Leave""? No. No, no, no. We... We gotta get you into Heaven."
15,2,KEVIN,How? Belphegor says... I've been in Hell. Heaven can't let me in.
15,2,SAM,"Kevin, being a ghost with nothing to hold you... anywhere... that would be a terrible way to exist."
15,2,DEAN,That's true.
15,2,KEVIN,"Look, I got two options... Hell or Earth. In one, I get tortured for eternity. In the other, I might go crazy. Guess I'll take door number two. I won't go back to Hell. Maybe... I know Belphegor can't power up the warding... but maybe he can make just a bit of it dip? You know, for a minute. E-Enough to let me out."
15,2,SAM,"I'm sorry, Kevin. I wish there was some way to make this right."
15,2,KEVIN,"Me, too, but there isn't. And sometimes, you just gotta accept that. Besides, I'm better off than I was and... I mean, there's a whole world out there."
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"Would you come on, already?"
15,2,DEAN,"Take care, Kev."
15,2,KEVIN,I love you guys.
15,2,CHUCK,Going somewhere?
15,2,AMARA,Yes.
15,2,CHUCK,Great. Where we headed?
15,2,AMARA,Alone. I'm going alone.
15,2,CHUCK,"Amara, we've been all through this.  We belong together."
15,2,AMARA,"Yes. Yes, yin, yang, balance of nature. I am willing to coexist with you, brother, in the universe. Just not, you know, anywhere near you."
15,2,CHUCK,"Hey, don't test me. I front the group. You sing backup."
15,2,AMARA,"Oh, really? Because you're ""God""?"
15,2,CHUCK,"Amara, just..."
15,2,AMARA,"Don't. Even on your best day, you couldn't force my hand. And this is not your best day. In fact, I don't think you can do much of anything. Ah, a few parlor tricks, perhaps, but you can't leave this world, not without my help. And me? I'm done, Chuck. I've changed. I've adapted. I've... I've become the better me. And you? You are still the same... petulant, narcissistic. So... I'm leaving you here. Once, long ago, you sealed me away. Now, in a way... I'm doing the same to you. You're trapped, diminished, abandoned. So I guess you got what you've always wanted. You're on your own."
15,2,DEAN,What's going on?
15,2,BELPHEGOR,"They just keep coming. Soon, they're gonna overrun us. Again. Once my spell comes crashing down..."
15,2,ROWENA,My little toy isn't strong enough to handle all this. We have to find another way. Before it's too late.
15,2,SAM,"Alright, then that's what we'll do."
15,2,DEAN,How?
15,6,DEAN,Why didn't you just stick to the damn plan?
15,6,CASTIEL,"The plan changed, Dean. Something went wrong. [Cas smites Belphegor in Hell]"
15,6,DEAN,"Yeah, why does that something always seem to be you?"
15,6,CASTIEL,I don't think there's anything left to say.
15,6,DEAN,Where are you going?
15,6,CASTIEL,I think it's time for me to move on.
15,6,ROWENA,"Magic can do anything. I'll absorb the ghosts and demons and return them to Hell. To perform this spell, I have to die, but it has to be you that kills me. [Rowena casts her spell]"
15,6,SAM,There has to be another way. [Rowena guides Sam's hand to stab her]
15,6,ROWENA,"Goodbye, boys. [Rowena falls into the Hell rift]"
15,6,JACINDA,"Mrs. MacLeod? It's Jessie, from 3C? Haven't seen you in a while. Everything okay?"
15,6,JACINDA,Aperiatur.
15,6,JACINDA,Okay. Game on. Come on! Where is the good stuff?
15,6,[INTERIOR,Bunker kitchen. Sam sits at the table with his laptop. Dean strolls in wearing pajamas and his robe and holding an empty cereal box]
15,6,DEAN,Hey.
15,6,SAM,Hey.
15,6,DEAN,"You know they still put, um, jokes on the backs of these things. Listen to this one... What's round and bad-tempered? ""A vicious circle."" 'Cause it's..."
15,6,SAM,"Yeah, I... I... Wait a second, did you eat the whole box?"
15,6,DEAN,Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm a champion.
15,6,SAM,"Wait a second. So I've been looking for signs of... of God or... or Lilith, and you've been in your room, eating cereal."
15,6,DEAN,"And marathoning ""Scooby-Doo"". Well, did you find anything?"
15,6,SAM,"No, not yet."
15,6,DEAN,Shocker.
15,6,SAM,"Hey, did you notice anything weird just now when you came in?"
15,6,DEAN,"No. Why, did you have another one of your visions?"
15,6,SAM,No. I haven't had a vision since Colorado. I think maybe they stopped.
15,6,DEAN,"Oh, I doubt it. Not until Chuck gets his end game, you know? The Winchester Bowl. Cain and Abel 2.0. This is God we're talking about. G-O-D. Wouldn't be too worried about finding him. He'll find us."
15,6,ANDY,"Hey, Clarence."
15,6,CASTIEL,Morning.
15,6,ANDY,"Come on in, early bird. Well... What can I do for ya? Bait working out good?"
15,6,CASTIEL,"Oh, yeah. The... Bait's good. I think it's the fish. They've begun to anticipate me."
15,6,ANDY,"Yeah, fish can be smart. I'd switch up spots. Maps are over there."
15,6,CASTIEL,I had a friend who always praised fishing for its meditative qualities. Wish I found it more relaxing. Andy... is everything all right?
15,6,ANDY,"Oh, uh... I'm, uh, volunteer fire department. We pulled a body out of the lake this morning. Missing kid. Shane Coogan."
15,6,CASTIEL,I'm sorry.
15,6,ANDY,"Yeah. You know, not my first dead body, but... Ah, the way he looked, I guessed he drowned. Except he was juiced."
15,6,CASTIEL,Juiced?
15,6,ANDY,"Mm. Like drained, like, of his blood. Weird, huh? Is that everything for you?"
15,6,CASTIEL,Yeah.
15,6,SAM,Eileen?
15,6,EILEEN,"Hi, Sam."
15,6,DEAN,"So, you were in Hell? You didn't make a deal. You were innocent. You've been down there this whole time?"
15,6,EILEEN,The Hellhound that killed me kind of dragged me there.
15,6,DEAN,Damn.
15,6,SAM,"Yeah, um, she escaped when, uh, Chuck blew all the doors open, and then..."
15,6,EILEEN,I hauled ass. Far as I could.
15,6,DEAN,"So by the time we got the barrier up, you were already gone."
15,6,EILEEN,"Been trying to get you guys to see me for a while now. This whole ghost thing doesn't really come with a handbook. Look, I don't know how all this works, but I know how it ends. We go crazy. We hurt people. I can't stay here, and I won't go back down there. So I thought... You guys know angels. Maybe if you put in a good word, you know, up there..."
15,6,DEAN,"Eileen, even if we did, it wouldn't matter. Souls from Hell can't go to Heaven. A friend of ours just found that out. I'm sorry."
15,6,EILEEN,Yeah. Me too.
15,6,SAM,"Nice, man. Real sensitive."
15,6,DEAN,You want me to sugarcoat it?
15,6,SAM,"No, I don't want... of course not. But, Dean..."
15,6,DEAN,"There may be an Option B. Do we have any of those soul catchers, you know, like the ones we used in Harlan?"
15,6,SAM,You want to trap Eileen in a prison full of psycho ghosts?
15,6,DEAN,"No, no, no. Not with them. We'd... We'd make her her own, you know? Look, it's better than where she was, and it's better than where she's going."
15,6,SAM,"Dean, that spell... it's not exactly easy."
15,6,DEAN,"Okay, but, you know, you're like, uh, Rowena's protégé. You're a regular Ginger Jr."
15,6,SAM,"Even if I could, I would need a crystal. I mean, those were Rowena's thing."
15,6,DEAN,"Okay. Look, man, this blows. I get it. I don't make the rules. A soul from Hell can't go to Heaven."
15,6,SAM,"All right, look, if it's what Eileen wants, then... Maybe we can go to Rowena's place and look for a crystal, or something. I've been meaning to go there anyways after, uh... You know."
15,6,DEAN,Great. Do that.
15,6,SAM,"Wait, wait. You're not coming with?"
15,6,DEAN,It's a milk run.
15,6,SAM,"You're... You know what, Dean, ever since God got back, you've been acting like there's nothing we can do, like nothing matters, but we can do this. Man, this matters."
15,6,DEAN,And that's why you're gonna kick it in the ass.
15,6,CASTIEL,When will the Sheriff be back?
15,6,SECRETARY,"Five minutes? An hour? It's Tuesday, Agent. He gets his hair cut on Tuesday."
15,6,CASTIEL,He gets his hair... I see.
15,6,MELLY,"You're FBI? I thought you were renting the Doweling cabin. Uh, small town..."
15,6,CASTIEL,"Uh... I'm, uh... I'm on vacation."
15,6,MELLY,"But you're looking into that missing boy, the one that they found in the lake?"
15,6,CASTIEL,Do you know him?
15,6,MELLY,"Uh, no, but I... I think my son's missing, too. Um... I... I let him camp out last night, and he was supposed to be back first thing this morning."
15,6,SECRETARY,"Honey, it's only a few hours. He'll turn up."
15,6,MELLY,"She thinks I'm overreacting because this town, it's like a postcard, but now, with that other boy, I just... I... I need to find my son."
15,6,CASTIEL,Right.
15,6,MELLY,"Please, um, Agent, um..."
15,6,CASTIEL,Um... Worley.
15,6,MELLY,Can you help me?
15,6,CASTIEL,Of course.
15,6,SAM,I... I'm sorry. I wish there was more we could do. I hate this for you.
15,6,EILEEN,"Whatever that crystal is, I'll take it. At least I won't be... you know."
15,6,SAM,"Yeah. I've been there, too... uh, Hell. A long time ago. You try and forget, but it gets inside you. Talking helps."
15,6,EILEEN,I can't. Not yet.
15,6,SAM,"After we met, I started practicing again. I guess some of it stuck."
15,6,EILEEN,Who's she?
15,6,SAM,I don't know.
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,"Well, look at you."
15,6,SAM,Wait a second.
15,6,EILEEN,She was goth?
15,6,SAM,"No, close. I recognize that. It's from the ""Ordo maleficarum""."
15,6,EILEEN,A witch.
15,6,SAM,"Yeah. Looks like she tore this place apart. I mean, maybe she got into something she shouldn't have."
15,6,EILEEN,Great.
15,6,SAM,"Okay, let's just find what we're looking for and get out of here."
15,6,SHERIFF ROY,"Melly Krokowski. From the day that woman graced us with her presence, it's always something... too much fluoride in the water, not enough vegan options at the 4th of July parade, that we even have the 4th of July parade."
15,6,CASTIEL,"Sheriff, her son is missing."
15,6,SHERIFF ROY,"And maybe if this were New York, I'd be worried. Here? A teenager stays out too long, he's probably with his buddies sobering up."
15,6,CASTIEL,So people rarely go missing here?
15,6,SHERIFF ROY,"I mean, not locals. But it is a tourist town. Some years, we lose a hiker. Somebody drowns."
15,6,CASTIEL,Like Shane Coogan?
15,6,SHERIFF ROY,No.
15,6,SHERIFF ROY,"Shane came out for last year's Bluegrass festival. Parents raised a big stink, but locals saw him holed up in the woods. Opioids. Wound up in the lake. O.D.'d."
15,6,CASTIEL,I'd like to take a look at the body.
15,6,SHERIFF ROY,Already on its way to Cheyenne. We don't have an M.E.
15,6,CASTIEL,"Well, any case work you do have will be fine."
15,6,SHERIFF ROY,"Which office you say you were from again, Agent Worley?"
15,6,CASTIEL,Special Agent. D.C.
15,6,SHERIFF ROY,"You got a supervisor I could talk to, make it official?"
15,6,DEAN,This is Assistant Director Kaiser.
15,6,SHERIFF ROY,Uh... This is Sheriff Alden Roy. Just checking on Agent Worley.
15,6,DEAN,"Would you put my agent on the phone, please?"
15,6,CASTIEL,Hello?
15,6,DEAN,Cas. Sam's been trying to call you.
15,6,CASTIEL,I know.
15,6,DEAN,Did you check his messages?
15,6,CASTIEL,Nope.
15,6,DEAN,"Right. Smart. Why would you? Look, I don't know if you care or not, but, uh... God... Chuck... is back on the board, so watch yourself. And check your damn messages."
15,6,CASTIEL,"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."
15,6,SHERIFF ROY,I'll get you those files.
15,6,CASTIEL,Thank you.
15,6,EILEEN,This is just junk.
15,6,SAM,"Tarot cards, self-help books. Where's her real stash? [Eileen notices something odd about a bookcase, and walks through the wall] Eileen?"
15,6,EILEEN,"Sam? In here. [Sam pushes open the bookcase, a hidden door to Rowena's secret lab] Ta-da! [Sam is overwhelmed as he explores, and finds Rowena's books] Sam?"
15,6,SAM,Uh... She kept journals.
15,6,EILEEN,Rowena?
15,6,SAM,Yeah. Her spell work. All of it. Right up until the end.
15,6,EILEEN,You miss her.
15,6,SAM,"I killed her. Her idea. She, uh, sacrificed herself to save us. To... To save the world. You ever feel like you're the punchline to some cosmic joke?"
15,6,EILEEN,Are you kidding?
15,6,SAM,"Rowena got it. I mean, she didn't know all the details, but she knew the game was rigged. So this... Magic. This is how she kept control."
15,6,SAM,No way.
15,6,EILEEN,Sam. What's going on?
15,6,SAM,"Okay. When my mom was killed, uh, Rowena tried to bring her back, but she couldn't. She needed a body, which we didn't have. Turns out, Rowena was working on a way to bring her back, a way around that, a-a way to make the spirit flesh."
15,6,EILEEN,She didn't use it?
15,6,SAM,"We ended up finding out my mom was in Heaven already and happy, so... She never finished it. But... I think I can finish it."
15,6,EILEEN,So?
15,6,SAM,"So... Eileen, we can bring you back."
15,6,SAM,All right. That's everything.
15,6,EILEEN,Sam? Sam? What's happening?
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,"Umbra, abi. Hello, Sam."
15,6,SAM,Who are you?
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,"Rowena MacLeod is dead. We came for what she left behind, and just when we thought we wouldn't get it... You come along. Hmm. Lucky us."
15,6,SAM,What?
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,"The apartment's hexed. It's potent magic. Anyone who steps insides dies. Except, apparently, you. Mm-hmm. Surprised? Yeah. Me too. I only know Rowena by reputation. Respect, but... To imagine her leaving all her Earthly treasures to you..."
15,6,SAM,So the body we found... That was one of yours.
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,"Mm. Jacinda, my oldest. She's young. She'll learn."
15,6,SAM,Now you're gonna bring her back.
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,"Well, of course I am, yeah. This is good magic."
15,6,SAM,"Listen, you need me."
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,Hmm.
15,6,SAM,You want Rowena's stuff? I can get it for you. But I need that spell.
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,"Oh. Hm. I'm sorry, no. I'd never give up my girl."
15,6,SAM,"Okay, then we'll both use it."
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,"We can't. A spell like this, you can only use once. Show Death a loophole, and she closes it. And, well, I think you'll help us anyway. Emily."
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,"Hmm. Now, a choice... you can do as you're told and die quick. Or you can play tough and... [She squeezes the voodoo doll and Sam cringes in pain] Oh. ... and die slowly. It's up to you."
15,6,EMILY,Hm.
15,6,MELLY,"Okay, so I followed you."
15,6,CASTIEL,"Melly, you shouldn't be here."
15,6,MELLY,"Please, Agent Worley, you have to let me help. I told Caleb to get off ""Fortnite"", to get some fresh air."
15,6,CASTIEL,This isn't your fault.
15,6,MELLY,What are those X's?
15,6,CASTIEL,They're where they found... A number of people have gone missing in this area.
15,6,MELLY,"And you think Caleb... No, he wouldn't come out here. He knows it's not safe. With the mine?"
15,6,CASTIEL,Mine?
15,6,MELLY,"Yeah, the old silver mine.The EPA shut it down in the '70s... toxic runoff."
15,6,CASTIEL,Can you show me where it is?
15,6,MELLY,No. But I can take you.
15,6,CASTIEL,Okay. Stay close.
15,6,SAM,"It's Emily, right? Is this your thing, robbing dead people?"
15,6,EMILY,No talking.
15,6,SAM,Right.
15,6,EMILY,"Make it quick, just the good stuff."
15,6,SAM,"Hey, I can look for something to cover her up."
15,6,EMILY,Do you think she's pretty? Everyone thinks she's pretty.
15,6,SAM,"I mean, uh, she's dead."
15,6,EMILY,For now.
15,6,SAM,Were you close?
15,6,EMILY,She made my life hell.
15,6,SAM,"Really? What did she do? Listen, I get it. All right? I mean, I... I have an older brother. When I was 10, he... he put superglue in my toothpaste."
15,6,EMILY,Yeah?
15,6,SAM,Yeah.
15,6,EMILY,"Once, she made me invisible... for a week."
15,6,SAM,"Okay, well, that's not so..."
15,6,EMILY,And she tried to sell my soul to a demon and she turned my first crush into a water balloon... and popped him.
15,6,SAM,Oh.
15,6,EMILY,And then she got mean. Start packing.
15,6,CASTIEL,Are we close?
15,6,MELLY,I think so. Thanks for doing this on your vacation.
15,6,CASTIEL,"Well, it's not really a... I needed to step away."
15,6,MELLY,"Burnout's a bitch, right?"
15,6,CASTIEL,"Yeah. My colleagues and I, we, uh... I guess you could say we had a falling out with management."
15,6,MELLY,"Trust me, I get it. I used to work in finance. Back in '08, all the bosses promised big changes, but nothing really changes, so I cashed out, took the kid, moved here. Thing is, taking yourself out of the game doesn't really change the game. But I had to, for Caleb, who says moving here ruined his life. Half the time, we're at each other's throats."
15,6,CASTIEL,"Well, I'm sorry."
15,6,MELLY,"No, we'll get through it."
15,6,CASTIEL,"Melly, you have to prepare yourself for something."
15,6,MELLY,What?
15,6,CASTIEL,"There are things in this world that aren't human. Shane Coogan was killed by one, a djinn, I think."
15,6,MELLY,"I'm sorry, a what?"
15,6,CASTIEL,"Monsters are real, and, given the number of missing people in the area, I think this mine may be a lair, and, if it is, I don't want you to see what's inside."
15,6,MELLY,But I don't want...
15,6,CALEB,Mom? Mom?
15,6,MELLY,Caleb!
15,6,CASTIEL,Oh!
15,6,EMILY,"Steve was a good bunny. But Jessie needed his bones, so."
15,6,SAM,"Yeah. Sorry, that's, uh... Wow."
15,6,EMILY,"I yelled at her, and she turned my tongue into a snake. I still have the scars where it bit me."
15,6,SAM,You know what? Listen. She doesn't have to come back. All right? You heard your mom. That spell only works once. If you give it to me...
15,6,EMILY,She'd kill me.
15,6,SAM,"Not if you ran. Rowena was a very powerful witch, maybe the most powerful of all time. I'll give you her books, her journals... whatever you want. Y-You could go somewhere else, start over again."
15,6,EMILY,"Liar! [she stabs the doll again, hard enough that Sam falls to the ground]"
15,6,CALEB,"I know... I know I wasn't supposed to be out here, but I..."
15,6,MELLY,"It's okay, honey. Just tell us what happened."
15,6,CALEB,You're not gonna believe me.
15,6,CASTIEL,"Yes, we will."
15,6,CALEB,"I saw some guy dragging a dead body to the lake. I couldn't see his face, so I grabbed my phone, I tried to bust his ass, but... It was a monster. I-I ran, but I fell, I broke my phone and messed up my ankle. I was hiding. I was so scared."
15,6,CASTIEL,The monster... did you get a good look at it?
15,6,SHERIFF ROY,"Yeah, he did. Unfortunately. Been looking for you. I try not to kill more than I have to, but now you and the kid are just such a big pain in my ass."
15,6,CASTIEL,You won't hurt them.
15,6,SHERIFF ROY,That right?
15,6,CALEB,Whoa. Whoa.
15,6,CASTIEL,"It's always you... you selfish little men in positions of authority. You take what you want, you take who you want. And you believe that your power will protect you. [Sheriff Roy shoots him in the heart, point blank, and Cas heals it again] Well, it won't protect you from me."
15,6,EMILY,Let's go. Don't make me hurt you.
15,6,DEAN,Witch-killing bullets.
15,6,SAM,"Dean, wait, she's..."
15,6,EMILY,"Let her go, or he dies."
15,6,DEAN,"Well, it looks like we got ourselves a little bit of a stand-off. Two on two."
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,More like two on three.
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,Ad elicienda alvos. Torto ventre. Ad elicienda alvos. Torto ventre. [to Emily] The doll! Kill him! Ad elicienda alvos. Torto ventre. Ad elicienda alvos.  Torto ventre.
15,6,EILEEN,"Not today, bitch."
15,6,DEAN,About time.
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,Ad elicienda alvos. Ad elicienda alvos. Torto ventre. Ad elicienda alvos. Torto ventre. Ad elicienda alvos. Torto ventre. Congelentur venae.
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,Cor marcascatur et in thorace concidatur. I'll grind your heart to dust. Congelentur venae. Cor marcascatur et in thorace concidatur. Con...
15,6,WITCH MOTHER,You... How?
15,6,SAM,I learned from the best.
15,6,EMILY,Start packing.
15,6,SAM,"O Ichor, igne putrefaciatur, ex sanguine flagrante, te invoco."
15,6,DEAN,Eileen!
15,6,EILEEN,Her... Her body!
15,6,DEAN,Come on.
15,6,MELLY,So you...
15,6,CASTIEL,Dropped him in the lake. I think I can help. May I?
15,6,CALEB,Holy crap! What... What?
15,6,MELLY,That's a... miracle. Were you sent by God?
15,6,CASTIEL,"Melly, I can't explain it to you. I... Well, even if I could, I think you're better off not knowing."
15,6,MELLY,What does that mean?
15,6,CASTIEL,"It means I'm happy I met you, and I'm glad we found your son."
15,6,MELLY,But now you're leaving.
15,6,CASTIEL,"Yeah. If I stay, nothing changes. It's time for me to get back in the game."
15,6,EILEEN,"Okay, so... I just, um... get in?"
15,6,SAM,Yeah. I guess. Then I say the words.
15,6,SAM,Mortuum oritur. Rutum revertitur. Ex spiritu incarnatum est. Oriatur et educatur. Oriatur et educatur.
15,6,SAM,Eileen?
15,6,EILEEN,"Sam? [she walks over to him, and signs] Thank you."
15,6,DEAN,How's Eileen?
15,6,SAM,"She, uh... She's asleep. She had a big day."
15,6,DEAN,"Well, so did you. Hex bags. New body. So, what, are you some kind of witch now?"
15,6,SAM,"Nah, I got lucky."
15,6,DEAN,"Yeah. I just wish we knew about that spell for Mom. You did good today, man. I did jack."
15,6,SAM,"You killed a witch, saved my ass."
15,6,DEAN,"Yeah, I guess so."
15,6,SAM,"You know what, I've been thinking about something you said, about how we don't make the rules, and you're right. We don't. We never have. But that doesn't mean we can just give up."
15,6,DEAN,"Oh, come on, man."
15,6,SAM,"We have moves to make here, Dean. We do. I mean, you think Chuck wanted me to shoot him? Of course not."
15,6,DEAN,"You sure about that? Maybe that was part of the plan, you know? That's the thing, man. I don't know what's God and what isn't, and it's driving me crazy."
15,6,SAM,"All I'm saying is we'll find a way to beat him. We will. I don't know how yet, but we will 'cause we're the guys who break the rules. But I can't do it without you. I can't. Just like I couldn't do it today without you. I need my brother."
15,7,SAM,You ever feel like you're the punchline to some cosmic joke?
15,7,DEAN,What the hell were you thinking?
15,7,CASTIEL,I think it's time for me to move on.
15,7,DEAN,Sam's been trying to call you.
15,7,CASTIEL,I know.
15,7,SAM,"When I shot Chuck, the bullet wasn't a bullet. It w... it was a piece of me. So, what if it created a-a link of some sort?"
15,7,SAM,"Eileen, we can bring you back."
15,7,ANGELA,"All right, we're almost there."
15,7,SALLY,"You're so good to me, Angela."
15,7,ANGELA,Mm-hmm.
15,7,SALLY,What would I do without you? Hmm? What would I do without my best friend?!
15,7,ANGELA,"Okay, Sally, okay, let's... let's just get you home."
15,7,SALLY,- Or...
15,7,ANGELA,Okay?
15,7,SALLY,... Ryan said there was an after party at his house.
15,7,ANGELA,"No, no, no. No more after parties. No more drinking. No more guys."
15,7,ANGELA,Sally?
15,7,ANGELA,Great. Purge your sins. Then we'll get you home.
15,7,SALLY,Angela? Angela?!
15,7,ANGELA,Hello?
15,7,DEAN,"Anything? Crop circles? Body without a heart? Anything? Come on, Internet."
15,7,DEAN,"Oh, hello. Yeah."
15,7,SAM,It's never enough food.
15,7,DEAN,Hey.
15,7,SAM,Ho-ho!
15,7,EILEEN,Hey.
15,7,SAM,Look who's alive.
15,7,DEAN,"Yeah, mostly."
15,7,SAM,"You hungry? We have, uh, eggs, pancakes, bacon."
15,7,DEAN,"That real bacon? 'Cause, you know, you..."
15,7,DEAN,Are you two hungover?
15,7,EILEEN,We might've gotten just a little carried away with the margaritas last night.
15,7,DEAN,Ho-ho! I knew I liked you.
15,7,EILEEN,Sit. Eat.
15,7,DEAN,"No, no. Uh, nah, I can't."
15,7,SAM,"W-W-Wait, wait. Wait. You're turning down bacon?"
15,7,DEAN,"Mm, yes, yeah, I'm actually... I'm gonna head out."
15,7,SAM,"Okay, fine. Just give us a second to wrap this up, and we'll come with you."
15,7,DEAN,"No, no, no. No. I'm... I'm... I'm good. You guys stay, eat. It smells terrific."
15,7,SAM,"Hey, Dean. Dean, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just hold on. Slow down."
15,7,DEAN,"No, I'm good. I'm good."
15,7,SAM,You're good? W-What does that mean you're...
15,7,DEAN,"It means I got to... I got to get out of here, okay? I just... I got to... I'm gonna take a drive, clear my head."
15,7,SAM,Alone?
15,7,DEAN,"Yeah, you know, you and Eileen, you guys are having fun. I don't want to spoil that, you know?"
15,7,SAM,"Yeah, go, go. Clear your head. Eileen and I have stuff to do."
15,7,DEAN,"Yeah, I'll bet you do. Yeah? Hmm?"
15,7,SAM,It's not like that. I-I-I meant looking for Chuck and Lilith and...
15,7,DEAN,"Sure. Got it. Um, okay, but if, uh, things go your way, just make sure you put the sock on the door so I know."
15,7,SAM,Call me if you need me.
15,7,DEAN,Always do.
15,7,EILEEN,Is he okay?
15,7,SAM,"I think. It's funny. After everything with Chuck, uh, Dean was so... down I-I-I thought he wouldn't get back up again, but... but now, him leaving? That's progress. Right?"
15,7,EILEEN,"Yeah, it is."
15,7,DEAN,"Excuse me, Sheriff."
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,May I help you?
15,7,DEAN,Agent Dukes.
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,"Dukes? Like ""put up your dukes""?"
15,7,DEAN,Exactly.
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,Sheriff Dillon.
15,7,DEAN,"Good to meet ya. Listen, I'm looking into the disappearance of Angela Sullivan."
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,Disappearance?
15,7,DEAN,Mm-hmm.
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,"Uh, I wouldn't go that far."
15,7,DEAN,No? Why not?
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,"Well, for one, Angela's car is gone. Cars don't usually disappear unless they're being driven somewhere."
15,7,DEAN,"Okay, so you think what?"
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,That girl wasn't taken. She left on her own.
15,7,DEAN,You sure about that?
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,"Look, this is a small town. Angela's mom and dad passed a few years ago, but even before they did, she was talking about moving to L.A., trying to get on one of them competition shows, like the one with the ""Knight Rider."""
15,7,DEAN,Right.
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,"It happens. Kids usually last about a week before they return. I stayed there a whole month. Oh, they don't know what they missed. I could've been the next Denzel. Huh?"
15,7,DEAN,"All right. Uh, why would her friend report her missing?"
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,I don't know. For the attention. Sally's got issues.
15,7,DEAN,What kind of issues?
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,The kind that keep her over at Swayze's Bar just about 24/7.
15,7,DEAN,"Swayze. Sheriff, thank you for your time."
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,No problem.
15,7,DEAN,Okay.
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,"Oh, Agent Dukes?"
15,7,DEAN,Yeah?
15,7,SHERIFF DILLON,"Hollywood ain't that far. You could catch Angela there. While you're at it, you could give show biz a shot for yourself. You've got the look."
15,7,DEAN,All right.
15,7,LORNA,"Hey, there."
15,7,DEAN,Nice place.
15,7,LORNA,Best beer and wings in the world.
15,7,DEAN,I'll be the judge of that.
15,7,LORNA,"Sure you will, handsome. But first, hand it over."
15,7,DEAN,My gun?
15,7,LORNA,"This is Texas, sweetheart. You can keep your gun. Cellphone. Ain't a party if everyone's on their phone."
15,7,DEAN,All right.
15,7,DEAN,Looking for someone.
15,7,LORNA,"Oh, but I think you found her."
15,7,DEAN,Yeah. Sally Anderson. Have you seen her?
15,7,LORNA,"Not yet, but it's ""two for Tuesday."" She'll show up."
15,7,DEAN,Thank you.
15,7,LORNA,Mnh-mnh. Thank you.
15,7,DEAN,Ooh.
15,7,LEE,Huh? Right there.
15,7,DEAN,Lee Webb.
15,7,WOMAN,"Hey, honey. Hi."
15,7,LEE,"[hugging the woman in greeting] Oh, hey. You like that?"
15,7,DEAN,Son of a bitch.
15,7,LEE,Dean frigging Winchester.
15,7,LEE,"I'll be damned. Man, come in here."
15,7,DEAN,The hell are you doing here?
15,7,LEE,"What am I d... I own this joint, man. What are you doing in here?"
15,7,DEAN,Working a case.
15,7,LEE,"You're still Hunting, huh?"
15,7,DEAN,"Well, yeah."
15,7,LEE,"Dean Winchester. Unbelievable. Hey, uh, Lor... Lorna? Lorna! Lorna! Hey, can we get a co... couple of beers for me and my... and my boy here? [to Dean] You got time, right?"
15,7,DEAN,Always.
15,7,LEE,All right.
15,7,DEAN,You own the place?
15,7,LEE,"Come on, dude."
15,7,DEAN,You sound good.
15,7,EILEEN,"My brain is just, like, melting."
15,7,SAM,"Yeah. Me, too."
15,7,EILEEN,"I need a break, and so do you. Why don't we do something fun?"
15,7,SAM,Yeah. Um... ideas?
15,7,EILEEN,"I mean, a few."
15,7,CASTIEL,Sam.
15,7,SAM,"Cas? Wh... What in the world, man? Where have you been? I-I've been calling you and texting..."
15,7,CASTIEL,"I know. I was... Well, it doesn't matter. I'm here now. I'm ready to help."
15,7,EILEEN,Hi.
15,7,SAM,"Yeah, uh, Cas, this is Eileen Leahy. Eileen, this is Cas."
15,7,CASTIEL,I thought you were...
15,7,SAM,"Uh, one-time thing."
15,7,CASTIEL,"Well, where's Dean?"
15,7,SAM,He went for a drive. He needed to clear his head. So we've been looking for signs of Chuck and Lilith.
15,7,CASTIEL,Lilith?
15,7,SAM,"Yeah, uh, she's back."
15,7,CASTIEL,Have you found them?
15,7,EILEEN,Not yet.
15,7,CASTIEL,It's because you're looking in the wrong places.
15,7,SAM,"What do you mean? Have you heard something on angel radio, or..."
15,7,CASTIEL,"No, no. It's been silent for months. But your wound... it's still not healed?"
15,7,SAM,No.
15,7,CASTIEL,"Good. I've been thinking about that gun, the, uh... the Equalizer? When you shot God, it fired a piece of your soul."
15,7,SAM,Okay.
15,7,CASTIEL,So there may be some of you inside Chuck.
15,7,EILEEN,Ew.
15,7,LEE,"Oh, tell me, brother..."
15,7,DEAN,Mm?
15,7,LEE,... how's the old man?
15,7,DEAN,"He died. Yeah, 13 years ago. But, hey, he was doing what he loved the most... kicking ass and taking names."
15,7,LEE,"Yeah. I'm sorry, man."
15,7,DEAN,I appreciate that.
15,7,LEE,I always liked that crusty son of a bitch.
15,7,DEAN,Yeah.
15,7,LEE,"You remember that time he caught us wasted on a Hunt? Hm? He was so mad, I-I thought he was gonna have an aneurysm."
15,7,DEAN,"Oh, man, but I tell you what. He always liked you. He always liked you. In fact, he said that he'd never seen anybody better in a fight, and that is high praise coming from my old man."
15,7,LEE,To John Winchester.
15,7,DEAN,"Hey, thank you."
15,7,LEE,"Yeah, yeah."
15,7,DEAN,"Man, so I don't think I've seen you since Sammy was in college."
15,7,LEE,Right.
15,7,DEAN,"I mean, hell, I-I thought you were..."
15,7,LEE,Dead?
15,7,DEAN,"Well, I mean, that's usually how this ends, isn't it?"
15,7,LEE,Yeah.
15,7,DEAN,Hm.
15,7,LEE,You remember that cult thing we did in Arizona?
15,7,DEAN,"Oh, yeah. I remember that."
15,7,LEE,"Yeah. Well, I did one more case after that, right around here, and... I decided that wasn't the life for me anymore. I scrounged up what I could, and I bought this joint. Living the dream."
15,7,DEAN,"Let me ask you something. You ever regret it, walking away?"
15,7,LEE,Not once.
15,7,SAM,"Cas, are you sure about this?"
15,7,CASTIEL,"No, but I am sure I can't heal the wound. Maybe I can probe it."
15,7,SAM,Probe it?
15,7,CASTIEL,"Study it, see if it can lead us to Chuck."
15,7,EILEEN,Is that dangerous?
15,7,CASTIEL,Probably.
15,7,SAM,All right. Let's do it.
15,7,EILEEN,Sam...
15,7,SAM,I'll be fine. I'm ready.
15,7,CASTIEL,This is gonna sting.
15,7,CASTIEL,"Sam, are you okay?"
15,7,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just, uh..."
15,7,CASTIEL,Sam!
15,7,EILEEN,Sam!
15,7,CASTIEL,Sam!
15,7,EILEEN,Sam!
15,7,[INTERIOR,"the bunker library, Cas sits at a table paging through a book while his phone rings. Dean's voicemail recording picks up]"
15,7,CASTIEL,"Dean, I need you to call me back. Sam is hurt, and I... [Cas pulls his phone away from his ear and holds it in front of his mouth] Where are you?"
15,7,DEAN,"Okay. One, three bottles of Jaeger is nobody's friend, and ""B,"" they were twins."
15,7,LEE,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
15,7,LORNA,Oh.
15,7,LEE,"Whoa, no, they were not twins. They were triplets, uh, and we split them up fair and square."
15,7,DEAN,That's right. Triplets. Yeah. Yep.
15,7,LORNA,Mm. Mmm.
15,7,DEAN,Hm.
15,7,SERGEI,Castiel.
15,7,CASTIEL,Sergei.
15,7,SERGEI,"I am surprised to hear your voice. After last time, I didn't think we'd ever do business again."
15,7,CASTIEL,"I, um... I nee... I need your help. Sam Winchester's hurt."
15,7,SERGEI,"And you, an angel of the Lord, are unable to heal him?"
15,7,CASTIEL,This wound is unusual. It's divine.
15,7,SERGEI,Interesting.
15,7,CASTIEL,"I figure, after Jack, you owe me."
15,7,SERGEI,"And I'd love to pay my debt, but, unfortunately, this weekend, I'm with my niece. She just got a rolling scholarship at USC, and I promised to take her shopping, so..."
15,7,CASTIEL,"Let me rephrase. If you don't help me tonight, I will find you and burn you alive."
15,7,SERGEI,"My, how your negotiation skills have improved."
15,7,SERGEI,Castiel?
15,7,CASTIEL,Hello? No. I need a favor.
15,7,DEAN,Ghost sickness.
15,7,LEE,Ghost sickness?
15,7,DEAN,"Ghost sickness. Man, it was no fun. Everything was scary. This cat jumped out at me, had me checking my pants. I'm not joking. It was awful, man. Whew!"
15,7,LEE,"You haven't even told me what case you're working on, man."
15,7,DEAN,"Oh. Right. So, a girl went missing. 'Course, the sheriff thinks it's nothing, right?"
15,7,LEE,"Yeah, well, the sheriff in this town couldn't find his ass with a flashlight and a map."
15,7,LEE,"Mm, no."
15,7,LORNA,"That's Angela, Lee. She's in here all the time."
15,7,LEE,Wait. Is this the girl that doesn't drink that much?
15,7,LORNA,That's the one.
15,7,LEE,But her friend?
15,7,LORNA,Like a fish.
15,7,LEE,Is like a fish.
15,7,DEAN,Huh.
15,7,LEE,"What are you doing, man?"
15,7,DEAN,What?
15,7,LEE,"You're chasing missing persons, huh? I thought you'd be on to something bigger by now, like the Loch Ness Monster... Bigfoot."
15,7,DEAN,"Trust me, uh, bigger doesn't always equal better. Besides, who's gonna look out after the little guy? God certainly isn't."
15,7,LEE,"Damn, brother, that's dark."
15,7,DEAN,"Yeah, it's been a rough, uh... it's been a rough decade, Lee."
15,7,LEE,Yeah.
15,7,DEAN,"But that's a conversation for a different time, 'cause this, this right here, this is all right."
15,7,LEE,"Well, I'm glad you approve. This is nothing you can't have, man."
15,7,DEAN,"Oh, come on. Who's gonna kill the bad guys?"
15,7,LEE,"Somebody else. Dean, how many lives you think you saved, huh? Hundreds? Thousands? You deserve a break, bro. Hell, you might even deserve two."
15,7,LEE,Remember that old song your dad used to play us before we'd go out on a Hunt?
15,7,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, he'd pop it in the tape deck, say, ""Listen up, boys. This is real music."""
15,7,LEE,He wasn't wrong.
15,7,DEAN,"Oh, no."
15,7,LEE,"Oh, yeah. [to the band] ""G.O.B.,"" boys. [to Dean] Let's go. [from up on stage, at the microphone] Come on, boy. You can't just sit around lip-synching ""Eye of the Tiger"" while no one's watching. Come on. Get up here."
15,7,LEE,Yeah! Come on! Whoo!
15,7,LEE,Whoo!
15,7,AUDIENCE,Wow! Come on!
15,7,DEAN,Ha! You son of a bitch.
15,7,DEAN,"Whoo. Well, never got a standing ovation before."
15,7,LEE,"Yeah, feels pretty good, don't it?"
15,7,SALLY,Stop it! Hey! Hey! Leave me alone.
15,7,MAN,Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
15,7,SALLY,Back the hell up.
15,7,DEAN,Hey.
15,7,SALLY,"Stop, stop, stop!"
15,7,MAN,Don't be like that.
15,7,SALLY,"No, no. Stop!"
15,7,DEAN,"""Road House"" rules?"
15,7,LEE,"""Road House"" rules."
15,7,SALLY,Stop! Stop!
15,7,DEAN,Hey. Hey! I think you fellas have had enough. Time to leave.
15,7,MAN,Nah. I think we'll stay a while.
15,7,LEE,Still got it.
15,7,LORNA,Bunch of jerks.
15,7,SALLY,Yep.
15,7,LORNA,"You all right, Sally?"
15,7,DEAN,Sally? Sally Anderson?
15,7,SALLY,Yeah. Why?
15,7,SERGEI,Castiel.
15,7,CASTIEL,Sergei.
15,7,SERGEI,"Oh, the home of the fabled Men of Letters. So the stories are true. This place... what wonderful things you must have."
15,7,CASTIEL,"Okay, that's enough. You're here for a reason."
15,7,SERGEI,Aren't we all?
15,7,EILEEN,Help him. Please.
15,7,SERGEI,"'Course, my dear."
15,7,SERGEI,Hmm.
15,7,CASTIEL,What?
15,7,SERGEI,Small thing.
15,7,CASTIEL,What is it?
15,7,SERGEI,Sam is... dying.
15,7,SALLY,"She was a good girl, you know? She... she loved Jesus and..."
15,7,LEE,"And... and America, too."
15,7,DEAN,"Sally, just... just tell me what happened."
15,7,SALLY,"We left B's around closing. I was pretty hammered, but Angela, she was helping me to her car when I needed... you know, I got sick. And when I was done, she was gone. Angela was raptured, and I was left behind."
15,7,DEAN,"And the car went missing, too, right?"
15,7,SALLY,"Yeah, it got raptured, too, I guess."
15,7,LEE,Y-You can't... you can't rapture a car.
15,7,SALLY,It was a good car.
15,7,LEE,"Dean, can I talk to you for a second, man? Man, come on.  Her story, dude. I mean..."
15,7,DEAN,"I know, I know. Look, she's not the most reliable witness, but... but best friends don't just up and leave without saying goodbye."
15,7,LEE,Unless they deserve it.
15,7,DEAN,"Yeah, but something seems off here."
15,7,LEE,I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll lock the joint up. You and I can work the case just like old times.
15,7,DEAN,Great.
15,7,LEE,Yeah.
15,7,DEAN,"All right, well, first things first, where do you, uh... where do you dump a car around here?"
15,7,LEE,"Um, the lake maybe."
15,7,LORNA,"Or the wrecking yard. Look, I don't want to know. I'm just saying, if I had to get rid of something, Merle's is the place I'd do it."
15,7,LEE,"I mean, that's... I think the lake."
15,7,DEAN,"Look, I'll check the scrapyard, okay? You, you take the lake."
15,7,LEE,Okay. Oh.
15,7,CASTIEL,What do you mean he's dying?
15,7,SERGEI,"I imagine you were trying to ascertain the exact nature of the wound before this, yes?"
15,7,EILEEN,Yes.
15,7,SERGEI,"Ah, well, there you go. Most wounds want to be healed, to be whole. But this, this wound is different. It goes down to his very soul. But also out into the world. From what I can tell, his soul, it's connected to something or someone somewhere. Except, as you probed deeper, you forced the soul to stretch from Sam's body to..."
15,7,EILEEN,Where?
15,7,SERGEI,"I don't know. But now it's like a rubber band. If it is stretched too far, too long, pop, it snaps, and Sam dies."
15,7,EILEEN,Can you fix it?
15,7,SERGEI,Of course I can.
15,7,DEAN,Oh. Damn it.
15,7,LEE,"Couldn't leave well enough alone, could ya?"
15,7,SERGEI,There. Done.
15,7,CASTIEL,And nothing's happening.
15,7,SERGEI,Wait for it.
15,7,EILEEN,Sam? Sam. Sam?
15,7,CASTIEL,What are you doing?
15,7,SERGEI,I made it worse.
15,7,CASTIEL,You said he could die.
15,7,SERGEI,Will die. And soon.
15,7,EILEEN,No.
15,7,SERGEI,That won't help. It's already done. Unless.
15,7,CASTIEL,What?
15,7,SERGEI,You give me what I want.
15,7,EILEEN,"Fix him, or I kill you."
15,7,SERGEI,"You kill me, he dies. Or you give me the Key to Death, and he lives."
15,7,EILEEN,What?
15,7,SERGEI,"You really have no idea about the treasures this place holds, do you? The Men of Letters, some time ago, procured a very important item... a black key, handle in the shape of a skeleton. It can open a door to Death's library. You will find it and give it to me, and..."
15,7,CASTIEL,No.
15,7,SERGEI,"Castiel, please. You can't win this."
15,7,CASTIEL,"Yes, I can."
15,7,SERGEI,Anna.
15,7,CASTIEL,"A friend, Bobby, he's been watching her. And one word from me, and, well, you know what happens. Fix Sam. Now. Now."
15,7,SERGEI,"Alnoth, por Cantin Pre Tally Noth."
15,7,EILEEN,Sam? Are you okay?
15,7,SAM,I think.
15,7,CASTIEL,What about your wound?
15,7,SERGEI,"It's still there, but he's back. So we good?"
15,7,CASTIEL,For now.
15,7,SERGEI,"Mm. I like this you, Castiel. It's very... Russian."
15,7,DEAN,Lee?
15,7,LEE,"You awake, buddy?"
15,7,DEAN,"The hell are you doing, man?"
15,7,LEE,"You had to hit the junkyard, didn't you?"
15,7,DEAN,"Look, I don't know what's going on, okay? But this is not you."
15,7,LEE,"Well, not the old me, anyway. I wasn't kidding about Arizona. What that thing did to that family, those kids, it stuck in my head. If evil like that exists in the world, then guys like you and me, we ain't ever gonna win. The best we can do is just have a little fun. The last Hunt I did, the one right around here, I found something."
15,7,LEE,"It's called a marid. It's a freaky-looking little thing, isn't it?  [Lee laughs, and Dean stares at him, incredulous] Ah. As long as you feed it, it gives you money, it gives you health, everything you dreamed of."
15,7,DEAN,"And so, what, it just costs innocent lives?"
15,7,LEE,"Dean, you and I both know no one's innocent. After everything we've done, aren't... aren't we owed a little happiness, huh? Don't we deserve that much?"
15,7,DEAN,"Listen to yourself. ""We're owed."" ""We deserve."" Come on, man. You're not God. Hell, God's not even God."
15,7,LEE,"Good or bad... the world doesn't care. No one cares, Dean."
15,7,DEAN,"Well, I do."
15,7,LEE,"Yeah. And that's what got you here. Now, takes a while to drain a man, but listen to me. Don't worry about it, all right? Don't worry because once you lose a couple of pints, you just fall asleep, and then it'll be over."
15,7,DEAN,Lee.
15,7,LEE,"This... this is not how I wanted this to go, Dean. When that blonde girl walked in here last night, I should've know, you know, Dean Winchester, the righter of wrongs, you were gonna keep digging, and you were gonna figure me out. And if it's got to be you or me, well, I got to pick me, man."
15,7,DEAN,Lee. Lee!
15,7,DEAN,Sorry about your friend.
15,7,DEAN,"Oh, God bless Texas."
15,7,DEAN,"I'm out. And by my count, so are you."
15,7,LEE,"You're hardcore, brother."
15,7,DEAN,"No. No, you don't get to pretend like we're still friends. I don't know you."
15,7,LEE,"You don't, Dean? I am you. I'm just you that woke up and saw that the world was broken."
15,7,DEAN,Then you fix it. You don't walk away. You fight for it.
15,7,LEE,"Right. What do you say we act like this never happened, hm? Y-You just walk out that door."
15,7,DEAN,I can't do that.
15,7,LEE,You really want to do this?
15,7,DEAN,"No, I don't. But I kill monsters."
15,7,LEE,You want a shot at the title?
15,7,DEAN,Don't mind if I do.
15,7,LEE,"Ohh. All right. I'll be damned. Why do you care so much, Dean?"
15,7,DEAN,Because someone has to.
15,7,LEE,"Well, then... I'm glad it was you. Wait, wait. [He pats Dean's chest] Okay, okay."
15,7,DEAN,Hey.
15,7,CASTIEL,Dean.
15,7,DEAN,"I got your message. Sam, is he, uh..."
15,7,CASTIEL,He's fine.
15,7,DEAN,Good. That's good.
15,7,CASTIEL,Yeah.
15,7,DEAN,Good.
15,7,SAM,"I feel like, uh... I feel like I was in his head."
15,7,DEAN,You were in Chuck's head?
15,7,SAM,"I think so. A-And I-I think I-I saw his memories. Dean, Chuck is weak. I think we can beat him. I think we can beat God."
15,9,CAS,God is back.
15,9,DEAN,Jack's gone.
15,9,CHUCK,Welcome to the End.
15,9,JACK/BELPHEGOR,Hello.
15,9,CAS,That's not Jack. That's a demon.
15,9,AMARA,You're not complete. You need me.
15,9,ROWENA,Oh!
15,9,SAM,"When I shot Chuck, the bullet wasn't a bullet. It w— it was a piece of me. I feel like I was in his head. I saw his memories."
15,9,SAM,We just need to speak to Michael.
15,9,ROWENA,The out-of-his-head archangel?
15,9,SAM,We need your help.
15,9,CAS,Where's Sam?
15,9,DEAN,Eileen hit a snag with a case.
15,9,CHUCK,"Hi, Sam."
15,9,MICHAEL,"I will help you. What was done in the darkness can be done to God. That's the spell. To bind the spell together, the nectar from a Leviathan blossom."
15,9,DEAN,"What is that, like a flower?"
15,9,MICHAEL,A flower that only grows in one place. Purgatory. [Snaps] That's the door. It'll remain open for 12 hours.
15,9,CHUCK,"Hi, Sam."
15,9,EILEEN,I'm sorry.
15,9,SAM,"It's not your fault, Eileen. Is it?"
15,9,EILEEN,What are you doing to me?
15,9,CHUCK,"Same thing I've been doing for weeks— helping, helping you to the bunker, to Sam... to romance. It was easy, really, just a nudge here, a conveniently placed spell there."
15,9,SAM,Wait. That was you?
15,9,CHUCK,"Uh, it wasn't all me, Sam. I just gave you half the spell. You did the rest all on your own... which I knew you would... [Sam struggles against his restraints as Chuck mills around him]...because you're such a good guy."
15,9,SAM,Why?
15,9,CHUCK,"I couldn't see you. I needed eyes and ears on the inside. Well, eyes, anyway."
15,9,EILEEN,Screw you.
15,9,CHUCK,"Yeah. You know, I hate missing my favorite show."
15,9,SAM,So I was right. You're weak.
15,9,CHUCK,"Well, I wouldn't say ""weak,"" exactly. I mean, I piñata'd Hell. But, yeah, you figured it out – we're connected by these wounds. Which – [Chuckling] annoying, right? And as long as we are, I'm stuck in this world. But you know what they say... ...all good things must come to an end."
15,9,DEAN,"Come on, Sam!"
15,9,SAM'S VOICEMAIL,This is Sam. Leave me a message.
15,9,CAS,Have you tried Eileen?
15,9,DEAN,Yeah. Same thing – no answer.
15,9,CAS,"Well, maybe they just have their hands full with her case."
15,9,DEAN,Yeah. Or they're in trouble.
15,9,SAM,What are you doing?
15,9,CHUCK,"Our wounds aren't healing properly. Because of you. It's as if there's something festering inside of you, something that won't let go."
15,9,CHUCK,"Now, I can't see it. I can't snap it away. But I know it's there."
15,9,SAM,"So, what, are you gonna just cut it out?"
15,9,CHUCK,"Hey, good idea."
15,9,DEAN,"Eileen, where the hell are you?"
15,9,DEAN,Eileen?
15,9,CHUCK,"I don't really know what I'm looking for here, so this might get messy."
15,9,CHUCK,"I think we have an audience. Come on, Eileen."
15,9,DEAN,Eileen?  Eileen?
15,9,CHUCK,"Hi, Dean."
15,9,DEAN,"Chuck, you dick."
15,9,CHUCK,"Bye, Dean."
15,9,CHUCK,"Now, where were we? Right."
15,9,DEAN,How the hell did this happen?
15,9,CAS,What are you doing?
15,9,DEAN,"Tracking Sam's phone. Okay, here we go. Uh... Milford, Nebraska, at a casino. What the hell is Chuck doing at a casino? Whatever. We need to go."
15,9,CAS,To Purgatory.
15,9,DEAN,Chuck has Sam. I'm not leaving him.
15,9,CAS,Chuck's not gonna kill him. That's not the ending.
15,9,DEAN,Wh— Then he'll torture him.
15,9,CAS,"Dean, will you stop? Just stop being so stupid."
15,9,DEAN,What?
15,9,CAS,"If we attack Chuck now, we don't have anything that can hurt him. We get that Leviathan blossom, complete Michael's spell, build the Cage. That's our chance. That's the way we'll save Sam, and that's the way we'll save the world."
15,9,SAM,"What's the matter, Chuck?"
15,9,CHUCK,Nothing. I'm just – I'm thinking.
15,9,SAM,No. You're stalling.
15,9,CHUCK,What? Am not.
15,9,SAM,You are.
15,9,CHUCK,Mnh-mnh. No.
15,9,SAM,"Yeah. You blink people out of existence. But when it's time to get your hands dirty, you can't do it. You just like to watch. Wow, Chuck. That – That's a... I don't even know what to call that."
15,9,EILEEN,I do. I'd call it pathetic.
15,9,CHUCK,You know what? You're right. I do like to watch. Eileen.
15,9,EILEEN,Sam... No.
15,9,SAM,What are you doing to her?
15,9,EILEEN,"Stop, please."
15,9,CHUCK,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Ah, why didn't I think of this first? It's so much more poetic. Eileen? She's still in there, Sam. This is gonna hurt her as much as it hurts you."
15,9,SAM,Ahh!
15,9,CHUCK,Ohh. Mnh! Maybe not quite as much.
15,9,DEAN,"I mean, how the hell are we supposed to even know what we're looking for here? You know, Michael coulda done us a solid and drawn us a picture."
15,9,CAS,"You know, of all the time I've been in Purgatory, I've never seen a bloom of any kind."
15,9,DEAN,Yeah. Exactly.
15,9,CAS,"Well, if we see it, we'll know. It's likely to be the only flower here."
15,9,CAS,What?
15,9,DEAN,"You go that way. I'll go this way. We'll meet back at the Rift, alright? We'll cover more ground. We'll better our odds."
15,9,CAS,Yeah. We'll also improve our odds of getting lost or killed. Come on.
15,9,Sam,Ahh! Ahh! [to Eileen] It's okay. It's okay. I know – I know it's not you. [to Chuck] It's not working.
15,9,SAM,"I'm gonna die in this chair, Chuck."
15,9,SAM,"Ahh! Aah! Mnh. 'Cause you'll keep cutting until I bleed out, and... that's 'cause you don't know what else to do. What then, Chuck? You – You – You just bring me back and try again?"
15,9,CHUCK,Son of a bitch!
15,9,SAM,Like what?
15,9,CHUCK,This...defiant.
15,9,SAM,It's not my first time on the rack.
15,9,CHUCK,"No, no, no, no. No, this is more. This is...hope. Ah. That's what's stopping me – you. You still think that Dean and Cas are gonna fly through those doors just in the nick of time. You still think that you're the hero of this story. You still think you can win."
15,9,DEAN,I think we're going around in circles. We've seen this corpse before.
15,9,CAS,"No, Dean, my sense of direction is excellent. That's a different corpse."
15,9,DEAN,I don't know.
15,9,LEVIATHAN,Ugh!
15,9,DEAN,You're right. It is a different corpse.
15,9,CAS,We saw you following us.
15,9,DEAN,Thought you'd never make your move.
15,9,LEVIATHAN,What do you want?
15,9,DEAN,"Well, it's a little embarrassing saying it loud, but we're looking for a flower."
15,9,LEVIATHAN,"A flower? What do I look like, a florist?"
15,9,DEAN,"Well, if you can't help us, see this boom stick? It's loaded with Borax-filled shells. You know what Borax does to piranha-faced freaks like you? I'd be happy to show you."
15,9,LEVIATHAN,We don't call it a flower. There's a blossom. Grows out of the soil when we die.
15,9,CAS,When...Leviathan die?
15,9,DEAN,"Oh, okay. Cool."
15,9,LEVIATHAN,"I – Hey! The body has to rot. It can take months. And then these blossoms bloom. Tan husks, bloody red centers. I know a place. Not far."
15,9,DEAN,"And look at that. Thought you weren't a florist. Get up. [The Leviathan does, and starts to walk away. Dean stops him] Wait. You know a vamp around here named Benny? Burly guy, Cajun?"
15,9,LEVIATHAN,"No. Heard of him, though. Everybody has. The guy who got out and then came back. Like an idiot."
15,9,DEAN,Pretty much. Where is he?
15,9,LEVIATHAN,"Dead. Long time ago. His own kind – they didn't trust him, and they – ksch! – ripped him apart."
15,9,DEAN,Move.
15,9,CHUCK,"How do I put this to you, Sam? Your hope is... misplaced. Now, I'm not saying you can't win. I mean, if you stay firm and Dean and Cas don't screw up their part, with the exact right roll of the dice... you could. But what I'm saying is... you don't want to. You think you do, but you don't. Not if you knew. Not if you could see what I see. You want to know what happens when you win? Here. I'll show you."
15,9,EILEEN,"Whoa. [Gasps as she reads an article under the headline ""Mystery of Missing Florida Man Solved]"
15,9,SAM,Find something?
15,9,EILEEN,No. That man who disappeared in Florida –
15,9,SAM,Yeah.
15,9,EILEEN,Turns out he was eaten by an alligator.
15,9,SAM,"Hey, Dean, if you're tired, why don't you go to bed?"
15,9,DEAN,"I'm not tired. I'm not tired. I'm just resting my eyes. I'm good. [Cas brings four bottles of beer into the library and sets them on the table] Ooh. Jackpot. [Dean shuts his laptop and takes a beer from Cas] Ahh. Thanks. Alright, well, I say let's call it, hmm? Movie night?"
15,9,EILEEN,I'll make popcorn.
15,9,SAM,Oh. Jody. Jody. Hey. How's it going? Jody?
15,9,JODY,Sam...
15,9,SAM,Yeah. Hey.
15,9,JODY,"It was just supposed to be a little nest, maybe three vampires. Claire and I went in armed to the teeth, but there were more. So many more. She's dead, Sam. Claire's dead. Claire's dead."
15,9,CHUCK,"Oh, that was just the beginning. No. This is... the rest. The other side of victory. What happens next. [He holds up a pocket watch] You just set it forward to any day or time, and you can see it all."
15,9,SAM,Nothing you show me... You cannot change my mind.
15,9,CHUCK,"Then it doesn't change your mind. Come on, Sam. Don't you want to see the future?"
15,9,CAS,Sorry about Benny.
15,9,DEAN,I owed him my life. And he sacrificed himself to get Sam out of this place.
15,9,CAS,"Well, this place will bring that out in you. Guilt. It was my fault the Leviathan got out. It was my fault we were here the first time. I carry that guilt every day."
15,9,DEAN,"I know you're sorry, Cas. About Bel, about Mom."
15,9,CAS,I was talking about Jack. I already apologized to you. You just refused to hear it.
15,9,DEAN,Sorry I brought it up. Maybe if you didn't just up and leave us.
15,9,CAS,"You didn't give me a choice. You couldn't forgive me. And you couldn't move on. You were too angry. I left, but you didn't stop me."
15,9,DEAN,I know what you're thinking. But we did everything we could.
15,9,SAM,"No, we didn't. We could've gone in there sooner."
15,9,DEAN,The place was crawling with wolves. We had to wait.
15,9,SAM,"And because we waited, the victims – they all died. They bled out on the floor. Now, if Cas was still here, he could've healed them."
15,9,DEAN,"Yeah, well, he's not."
15,9,SAM,Cas?
15,9,DEAN,"They're winning, Sam. The monsters are winning."
15,9,LEVIATHAN,It's up this way. Just like I promised.
15,9,CAS,Leviathan blossom.
15,9,DEAN,"Alright, well, grab one. Let's get the hell out of here."
15,9,DEAN,Cas?
15,9,CAS,It's an angel trap. You tricked us.
15,9,LEVIATHAN,Mother's got beef with you.
15,9,CAS,Eve. Eve.
15,9,LEVIATHAN,"Killing her alphas, swallowing her Leviathan. Bringing you to her should earn us a nice reward."
15,9,DEAN,"What do you mean, ""us""?"
15,9,CAS,Dean!
15,9,DEAN,"No. [he looks around, and is alone] Cas? Cas!"
15,9,DEAN,"What are you doing? Come on, man. We just got back."
15,9,SAM,"I-If we don't hustle, the nest'll move on."
15,9,DEAN,"No, Sam. It doesn't matter."
15,9,SAM,What are you saying?
15,9,DEAN,What I've been trying to say for months. It's time... time to stand down.
15,9,SAM,"You want to quit? What's happened to you, Dean? Ever since –"
15,9,DEAN,"Ever since what? We lost pretty much everyone we've ever cared about? Ever since the Mark made Cas go crazy? Ever since I had to bury him in a Ma'lak box? Ever since then? Yeah. You know why? 'Cause the monsters – they're everywhere. Everywhere! What we do – it's not even Hunting anymore. It's whack-a-mole. We don't even save people. Every friend we've ever had is either dead, or they got wise and they packed it in."
15,9,SAM,"Jody's still fighting, and Bobby –"
15,9,DEAN,"Bobby has a death wish, and you know it. And Jody – ever since what happened to Donna and the girls, she does, too. And after Eileen... so do you."
15,9,SAM,"No. What happened to Butch and Sundance? Dean, what happened to going out swinging?"
15,9,DEAN,"We lost, brother. We lost. I'm done."
15,9,SAM,"No, no, no. Dean... Dean!"
15,9,SAM,"This is a lie. Chuck, I know what you're doing. Chuck?!"
15,9,CHUCK,Enjoying the show?
15,9,SAM,"You're just showing me this so I give up, so I lose hope."
15,9,CHUCK,"I'm just the messenger, Sam. I'm sharing my omniscience with you."
15,9,SAM,"No, the Dean I know... the Dean who raised me – he'd never give up, no matter how bad things got."
15,9,CHUCK,"Well, he does. He will. This is the truth, Sam. This is what comes next."
15,9,DEAN,Cas!
15,9,DEAN,"No, no, no. [Dean looks around and then speaks quietly in prayer] Cas? Cas, I hope you can hear me... that wherever you are, it's not too late. I should've stopped you. You're my best friend, but I just let you go. 'Cause it was easier than admitting I was wrong. [Dean breaks down, sniffles, and then kneels at the base of the tree]"
15,9,SAM,I'm raiding that nest with or without you.
15,9,DEAN,"Then I guess I don't have a choice, do I?"
15,9,SAM,No. It can't end like this.
15,9,CHUCK,See for yourself. You're holding the watch.
15,9,SAM,It's stuck.
15,9,CHUCK,"Guess that's as far as it goes, Sammy. The end of the line."
15,9,CAS,Dean.
15,9,DEAN,Cas?
15,9,CAS,You made it.
15,9,DEAN,I made it?
15,9,DEAN,You okay?
15,9,CAS,I'm fine.
15,9,DEAN,What happened?
15,9,CAS,"They were after me, not you. I figured it would be safest to give myself up."
15,9,DEAN,They take you to Eve?
15,9,CAS,Yeah. We were en route. I waited until I... saw this. [Cas pulls a blossom out of his coat] It got a little smushed.
15,9,CAS,"Once I had the blossom, I fought, caught them off guard. They fought back. I managed to get away."
15,9,DEAN,"You did it. You did it, Cas."
15,9,CAS,"Well, they're still after me. We should hurry."
15,9,DEAN,"Okay, Cas, I need to say something."
15,9,CAS ,You don't have to say it. I heard your prayer.
15,9,SAM,"Alright, only way in."
15,9,DEAN,Let 'em come.
15,9,SAM,We're outnumbered.
15,9,DEAN,"What else is new? Those bastards take us down, at least we go down together."
15,9,SAM,Butch and Sundance.
15,9,DEAN,Go out swinging.
15,9,BOBBY,"Hold up. You sure you want to do this, Jody? It's Sam and Dean."
15,9,CHUCK,"So, what'd you think?"
15,9,CHUCK,"I'm sorry, kid. It's a crappy ending. You and your brother deserve better."
15,9,SAM,"Yeah, right."
15,9,CHUCK,"No. I mean it. I-It hurts me to see you go out like that. Listen, I know our friendship has seen better days. But you have to know – you and your brother matter to me. Deeply. You still do. I want better for you both."
15,9,SAM,Where's Eileen?
15,9,CHUCK,She's fine. I powered her down in a broom closet. Don't change the subject.
15,9,SAM,"You know, Chuck... I've seen your plans. Dean and Me, Cain and Abel."
15,9,CHUCK,"You don't know what you saw, Sam."
15,9,SAM,I know it didn't look better to me.
15,9,CHUCK,"Okay, so, that way? Hmm? You being monsters? You being killed off by your friends? You really like that ending better?"
15,9,CAS,"Zee-loh-dah-rup, ah-lahr, zee-zohp, ah-buh-rah-muh-jzh, ahm-ee-zuh-pee --"
15,9,DEAN,Wait. Wait. Wait. Are you sure?
15,9,CAS,"Dean, you've already taken the Mark. You can't take it again. I can. It's the only way."
15,9,DEAN,Okay.
15,9,CAS,"Because I'm taking the Mark, someone else will have to destroy this. You or Sam."
15,9,SAM,"It'll be better. It'll be better. It'll be better. [Exhales sharply] If we win – When we win – When we beat you, I will make it better!"
15,9,CHUCK,"You can't, Sam. You, Sam Winchester, have been playing fast and loose with the laws of nature and magic for a very long time – you and your brother.  Always breaking the rules. And that's what I love about you, Sam. It's so heroic. It's so...Promethean. But there's still so much about the fabric of the universe that you don't know... that you can't know. 'Cause you're only humans. But I'm God. Think about what I showed you. Look beyond the Mark, beyond you and Dean fanging out – heartbreaking, but not the headline news."
15,9,SAM,The monsters.
15,9,CHUCK,The monsters.
15,9,CHUCK,"Without me, it's a law of nature – dark forces prevail, monsters rule, and you, your brother, and everyone you love will die. Can you really live with that?"
15,9,SAM,Dean? Help. Help me!
15,9,DEAN,Hey. Where's Chuck?
15,9,SAM,I don't know. He's close. Watch out!
15,9,DEAN,"Eileen, I don't want to hurt you."
15,9,CHUCK,"Hi, Dean."
15,9,DEAN,You know I had to.
15,9,Chuck,"Me, too."
15,9,CAS,Sam.
15,9,DEAN,"Sam, smash it. Now!"
15,9,CHUCK,"Well, Sam?"
15,9,DEAN,Sam!
15,9,SAM,I can't.
15,9,DEAN,What?
15,9,SAM,I can't. I'm sorry. I... I just can't.
15,9,DEAN,What did you do to him?
15,9,CHUCK,"Ahh. Ahh! Yeah! Oh, man. Whew! Yeah, that's the stuff."
15,9,CAS,What happened?
15,9,CHUCK,"Um, short version – Sammy lost hope, and now I'm free. Hey, take it easy on the kid. It took a lot to beat it out of him."
15,9,DEAN,"No. No! Well, what now? You're not gonna dust us."
15,9,CHUCK,"Oh, yeah? Why not?"
15,9,DEAN,"Because you're holding out. For your big finish. Yeah, we know about your galaxy-brained idea, how you think this story is gonna go. Sam got a little look into your draft folder."
15,9,CHUCK,"Sam's visions – they weren't drafts. They were memories. My memories. Other Sams and other Deans in other worlds. But guess what. Just like you, they didn't think they'd do it, either. But they did. And you will, too."
15,9,DEAN,No. Not this Sam. And not this Dean. So you go back to Earth 2 and play with your other toys. Because we will never give you the ending that you want.
15,9,CHUCK,We'll see.
15,9,SAM,I wish you'd stay.
15,9,EILEEN,"I wish I could. After what happened, I don't know what's real anymore."
15,9,SAM,I know that was real.
15,9,DEAN,Did she leave?
15,9,SAM,Yeah. Yeah.
15,9,DEAN,Sorry.
15,9,SAM,"That was our, uh, chance... to stop Chuck. But what Chuck showed me, what would happen if we trapped him – I believed him. I still do."
15,9,DEAN,"Well, that's good enough for me."
15,9,SAM,"Okay, uh, so, what now?"
15,9,CAS,"Well, Chuck's gone, but..."
15,9,DEAN,He'll be back.
15,9,SAM,If we can't kill him or trap him...
15,9,DEAN,"Well, then we find another way."
15,9,BILLIE,It's time.
15,9,DEAN,We did it. We did it!
15,10,GARTH,
15,10,ANNOUNCER,
15,13,CASTIEL,If the pizza man truly loves this babysitter...  why does he keep slapping her rear?
15,13,CASTIEL,I learned that from the pizza man.
15,13,RUBY,"So, where is it?"
15,13,DEAN,Where's what?
15,13,RUBY,The pizza.
15,13,DEAN,Alright. I'm done.
15,13,JACK,Hello.
15,13,SAM,Jack?
15,13,CASTIEL,Billie kept him hidden in the Empty until Chuck went off world.
15,13,BILLIE,It's time.
15,13,SAM,Jack still doesn't have a soul.
15,13,JACK,"If I do exactly what she says, if I follow her plan, I'll get stronger and I'll be able to kill God."
15,13,BILLIE,They're all dying. Each and every world.
15,13,CASTIEL,It's Chuck.
15,13,BILLIE,Mm-hmm. He's been a busy boy. Wiping the slate clean – for the end. This is your destiny. You are the messengers of God's destruction.
15,13,SAM,Any sign of him?
15,13,DEAN,"No, nothing yet. Chuck's probably trashing a few dozen universes outside of CNN's range."
15,13,Song continues,[Breathe in and get a bit higher. You’ll never know what hit you when I get to you.”]
15,13,ALT!SAM,Bro. We did it.
15,13,ALT!DEAN,"Aw, nuts."
15,13,SAM,"So, this rift is open in the middle of the armory, and the— and these two guys climb out of a car, and they look just like us..."
15,13,DEAN,"Except not, and don't even get me started about the car."
15,13,CASTIEL,"Okay, I am not understanding."
15,13,DEAN,"Yeah, well, welcome to the club."
15,13,SAM,"It's like they were us, but I guess from another world?"
15,13,DEAN,But how did they get here?
15,13,BILLIE,They were running. Because God was destroying their reality. He's almost done wrapping up those other worlds. And when he is...
15,13,SAM,It's our turn?
15,13,BILLIE,Looks like. So we need to be prepared. I have the next step. For Jack.
15,13,JACK,"I'm ready. Feeling, um, good about it."
15,13,BILLIE,The first quest was meant to strengthen Jack's body. Step two is more spiritual in nature.
15,13,CASTIEL,Can you be more specific?
15,13,BILLIE,Jack needs to find the Occultum.
15,13,SAM,"The Occultum? Occultum, that's, uh, Latin for ""hidden."" Where do we find it?"
15,13,BILLIE,"I don't know, it's hidden. Missing for centuries. Sacred, potent."
15,13,DEAN,"Is it a weapon? Uh, how does it work?"
15,13,BILLIE,Not a weapon per se. But it's powerful.
15,13,DEAN,Okay. Thanks. Big help.
15,13,BILLIE,"So, are you ready? Truly?"
15,13,JACK,I am.
15,13,BILLIE,"Good to hear. Because we need to be ready and vigilant... and not stupid. God – if he catches on to what we're doing, everything comes crashing down."
15,13,SAM,The Occultum – [Scoffs] there's barely even a mention of this thing. And nothing on where to find it.
15,13,DEAN,Mm-hmm.
15,13,SAM,"And what's this thing supposed to even do? It's ""spiritual""? What does that even mean? Dean? [Sam raps on the table when Dean doesn't reply] Dean."
15,13,DEAN,Hmm?
15,13,SAM,What are you doing?
15,13,DEAN,"I'm just thinking. I mean, this whole thing is crazy, right? I mean, uh, Death is our Obi-Wan, and you and me, we're the – the ""messengers of God's destruction"" – whatever the Hell that means – and Jack is supposed to kill God. But if he does... that still leaves you know who."
15,13,SAM,Amara.
15,13,DEAN,"So I'm thinking maybe he kills her, too."
15,13,DEAN,"Seriously. 'Cause listen, if we just take Chuck off the board, that still leaves her, okay? That throws things out of balance, and if things are out of balance, then the world pretty much – [Blows raspberry]"
15,13,SAM,"Yeah, ends. Right."
15,13,DEAN,"But if Jack kills her... Kind of a family plan. Then there's no God, there's no Darkness. Nothing out of balance. World saved."
15,13,SAM,"Okay, yeah, but then who takes over? Uh, Jack?"
15,13,JACK,I just learned how to do that.
15,13,DEAN,Probably not.
15,13,SAM,"Jack, listen, uh, about Billie's plan, uh, she hasn't been real specific on the details."
15,13,DEAN,"Yeah, when you – when you go up against Chuck, uh, you're gonna what, bob and weave? Or do you go straight in for the full smite?"
15,13,JACK,"Yeah, you know, um, something like that."
15,13,CASTIEL,"Okay, yeah. Fine. I owe you. [he disconnects the call] Well, I have information on the Occultum from the shaman Sergei."
15,13,DEAN,Him? Are we that desperate?
15,13,CASTIEL,I think so.
15,13,SAM,"So, what did he say?"
15,13,CASTIEL,The Occultum is divine in its origin. It was housed for hundreds of years in an ancient temple before it was –
15,13,DEAN,Plundered by pirates.
15,13,CASTIEL,No.
15,13,DEAN,It was dug up by tomb raiders.
15,13,CASTIEL,No.
15,13,DEAN,It was seized by the King of the Dead and his warlords. Am I close?
15,13,CASTIEL,Looted by invading Mongol hordes for trade on the –
15,13,DEAN,"Black market. Yeah, that's what – I was gonna say that next. That was the next one."
15,13,SAM,"Yeah. [Clears throat] So, uh, where is it now?"
15,13,CASTIEL,"Until a few years ago, it was owned by the Jacobson family, until Hyram Jacobson's son fell gravely ill. And he was told nothing could be done. And in desperation, he turned to a faith healer. She saved the child, but she would only accept the Occultum in payment."
15,13,DEAN,Do we have a name?
15,13,CASTIEL,"No, just a description. She was attractive. And she healed the child by laying on hands. Which glowed."
15,13,SISTER JO,Sam and Dean. You just keep turning up. My two bad pennies.
15,13,SAM,"Looks like, uh, business is still good."
15,13,SISTER JO,"Well, the healthcare system sucks, so I pick up the slack."
15,13,DEAN,Making house calls?
15,13,SISTER JO,Sorry?
15,13,DEAN,"Oh, maybe Hyram Jacobson recommended you to a few of his rich friends. I mean, one gazillionaire trumps a hundred sad sacks in a Kiwanis hall, am I right?"
15,13,SISTER JO,"Well, I really can't talk about that. Patient confidentiality."
15,13,SAM,"Right. Of course. Sure. In that case, uh, why don't you tell us about the Occultum?"
15,13,SISTER JO,What about it?
15,13,DEAN,We need it.
15,13,SISTER JO,Why?
15,13,SAM,To kill God.
15,13,SISTER JO,Hmm.
15,13,DEAN,"Turns out that Hail Mary that you and Cas tried, it worked. God's back, he's pissed, and he's gonna murder the world."
15,13,SAM,Unless we stop him.
15,13,SISTER JO,So you want me to be on your side... against God.
15,13,DEAN,"I mean, we are better-looking."
15,13,SISTER JO,"No. I'm not going to make God my enemy, because he's God."
15,13,SAM,Well... you don't have a choice.
15,13,SISTER JO,You wouldn't.
15,13,DEAN,Try us.
15,13,SISTER JO,I don't have it.
15,13,SAM,Then who does?
15,13,SISTER JO,An old friend of yours... Ruby.
15,13,SAM,Wait a second. Why would you give it to her?
15,13,SISTER JO,"It's a long story. I was on the road near Topeka... Long days of providing relief to the weak and weary. Alone, yet warmed by the comfort I provided.  When she found me."
15,13,RUBY,"Hey. Anything you want to tell me, Jo?"
15,13,SISTER JO,Nice vessel. Suits you better than the blonde.
15,13,SAM,Wait a minute. You were friends?
15,13,SISTER JO,"Oh, God, no. I mean, sometimes we'd pool our talents, run a job together if the opportunity presented itself."
15,13,RUBY,You've been holding out on me.
15,13,SISTER JO,"Ruby, I respect our arrangement. Do I butt in when some sap wants his soul back and you agree to return it for a tidy fee?"
15,13,RUBY,"And I'm good with your little bleeding-heart sideshow, but I'm talking way bigger than you usual take. The Occultum. You've got it. And I can get you a buyer... for a taste."
15,13,SISTER JO,And why would I agree to that?
15,13,RUBY,"Money. Do you have any idea how much that thing's worth? Millions. Now, tell me that doesn't appeal to your label-whore heart."
15,13,DEAN,And then?
15,13,SISTER JO,"I gave it to her. She said she had hid it, until she contacted the buyer. Which she never did because, well, you..."
15,13,RUBY,Aah!
15,13,SAM,"Okay, so where is it now?"
15,13,SISTER JO,Stashed. By her. In Hell.
15,13,CASTIEL,"Hey, Jack."
15,13,JACK,"Cas, you know what's good about being dead?"
15,13,CASTIEL,"Uh, as I recall, very little."
15,13,JACK,"Well, when you come back, you – you really get into all that life is. Hot, cold, sweet, spicy, funny, scary."
15,13,CASTIEL,"And are you? ""Into it""?"
15,13,JACK,I want to be. But I don't... feel things the way I used to. Before I lost my...
15,13,CASTIEL,Your soul.
15,13,JACK,"I used to feel things. In my bones. It was glorious, and sometimes unbearable. But I felt them. Now, I understand joy or sadness, but... I know those things aren't in me. I understand why Sam and Dean were angered by what happened to Mary..."
15,13,CASTIEL,By what you did to Mary.
15,13,JACK,Yes. I see that I've caused them pain. And it's clear that things have changed. Especially with – with Dean. Will he ever forgive me?
15,13,CASTIEL,"You know, Dean, he – he feels things more acutely than any human I've ever known. So it's possible he could work through this. One day, he may explode and let it all out and breathe deeply and move on."
15,13,JACK,How long will that take?
15,13,CASTIEL,I don't know.
15,13,DEAN,You sure you can swing this again?
15,13,SAM,"Well, we have Rowena's notes for the spell so..."
15,13,DEAN,"Okay, ""Samwitch."""
15,13,DEAN,"Let's do this. Cas, hey, good news. We sorta know where the Occultum is. Sorta. What? What's wrong?"
15,13,CASTIEL,Come with me.
15,13,DEAN,"Cas, what are we doing? Whoa. What the Hell?"
15,13,CASTIEL,They can't see us or hear us.
15,13,SAM,What happened? Where are they?
15,13,CASTIEL,"I don't know. I – I think, if Chuck tried to destroy them as their world's rift was closing, it's [Sighs] theoretically possible that the blast could've trapped them between dimensions. I mean, they're... they're here and yet not."
15,13,DEAN,Are they in pain?
15,13,CASTIEL,I don't think so.
15,13,DEAN,Good.
15,13,SAM,"Wait. Well, hold up, Dean. You – Will..."
15,13,DEAN,"We'll handle it, okay? We'll deal with them, but right now, you and me, we got to go to Hell."
15,13,CASTIEL,Whoa. You do?
15,13,SAM,Jo said that's where Ruby stashed the Occultum.
15,13,CASTIEL,Ruby? The demon you were sexually intimate with?
15,13,DEAN,"""Sexually intimate""?"
15,13,SAM,Yes.
15,13,CASTIEL,And you trust Jo now?
15,13,DEAN,"Well, Jo did help you out."
15,13,CASTIEL,"Yes, but Hell is a big place. You could be searching forever. We need more information, Dean."
15,13,DEAN,From who?
15,13,CASTIEL,What about Ruby?
15,13,DEAN,"Ruby's dead, Cas. We have to work with what we have. So we'll go to Hell, you stay topside and keep that spell alive so we get back, alright?"
15,13,DEAN,"Alright, next time we fly Air Abracadabra, we're upgrading to first class. I can't take the jet lag."
15,13,SAM,Where do we start?
15,13,DEAN,Hey. Hi.
15,13,DEMON,You shouldn't be here.
15,13,SAM,Yeah – we know.
15,13,DEAN,"We're, uh – We're looking for your boss, Rowena."
15,13,DEMON,She's hosting a reception. For newly condemned souls. Because that's a thing we do now.
15,13,DEAN,"Oh. Alright. But you could take us to her, right?"
15,13,DEMON,Yeah.
15,13,DEAN,Good.
15,13,JACK,So? They made it? Sam and Dean are in Hell?
15,13,CASTIEL,Yeah.
15,13,JACK,But?
15,13,CASTIEL,But there are just so many holes in Jo's story. Who was Ruby gonna sell the Occultum to? Why didn't Jo try to get it back?
15,13,JACK,So you think she's lying.
15,13,CASTIEL,I think we need to ask Ruby.
15,13,JACK,Who's dead.
15,13,CASTIEL,Yeah. In the Empty. I need your assistance.
15,13,JACK,"Uh, sure. Anything."
15,13,CASTIEL,I need you to kill me. Almost.
15,13,JACK,Can someone be almost dead?
15,13,CASTIEL,"Well, in theory... Aha. ...if I'm brought to death's brink, I should be able to put one foot in the afterlife and contact Ruby."
15,13,JACK,"Cas, the Empty doesn't exactly like you, remember?"
15,13,CASTIEL,"Yeah, I do. But our deal – I'm far from happy, so I should be fine. I need you draw out most of my life force, store it in here, and then keep a close watch. If it seems like I'm –"
15,13,JACK,"Really dying, not almost dying?"
15,13,CASTIEL,Then bring me back.
15,13,JACK,"Cas, I-I may not have a soul, but, uh, I know killing you is wrong. What if I screw up?"
15,13,JACK,Are you sure?
15,13,CASTIEL,Not at all. Give me one hour. Then bring me back.
15,13,DEMON,"This way, guys."
15,13,SAM,"Is it just me, or is this feeling like..."
15,13,DEAN,A trap.
15,13,DEMON,Aah!
15,13,SAM,Why you trying to kill us?
15,13,DEMON,Because she told us to.
15,13,DEAN,Who? Rowena?
15,13,DEMON,"Jo. She said if we helped her, [Gags] she'd bust us out of Hell."
15,13,SAM,And why'd she want us dead?
15,13,DEMON,Ask her yourself.
15,13,DEMON,Aah!
15,13,DEAN,That bitch set us up.
15,13,MAN,Sister Jo. You're still here. Maybe you can help...
15,13,SISTER JO,No Sister Jo here. Heard she retired. Florida. But here's some free advice – don't make friends. They always ask too much of you.
15,13,CASTIEL,"Ruby? Ruby? Can you hear me? Ruby. Ruby! Ruby, can you hear me? Ruby, can you hear me?"
15,13,MEG,"Hello, Clarence."
15,13,CASTIEL,Meg.
15,13,THE ENTITY,"Oh, not so much."
15,13,CASTIEL,You're the Empty.
15,13,THE ENTITY,"You always were quick. Apparently, you want to see Ruby, so I went with a demon theme."
15,13,CASTIEL,Where can I find her?
15,13,THE ENTITY,"What does this look like, a singles bar?"
15,13,CASTIEL,This is not a social call. I am here fulfilling a request ordered by Death herself. And I understand that you and she are working together.
15,13,THE ENTITY,"Oh, yeah, we're besties. But that doesn't mean I'm gonna help little ol' you."
15,13,CASTIEL,"Oh, yes, it does."
15,13,THE ENTITY,"Ugh. You're no fun. Go get her, Pizza Man."
15,13,CASTIEL,Ruby.
15,13,RUBY,Where am I?
15,13,CASTIEL,You're dead.
15,13,RUBY,I remember. Are you dead?
15,13,CASTIEL,Almost.
15,13,RUBY,Oh. Lucky you.
15,13,CASTIEL,"Ruby, I woke you up because I'm looking for an object known as the Occultum, and the angel Jo said you hid it somewhere in Hell."
15,13,RUBY,"Oh, did she? Wow, that is so like her. Don't you think it's a little obvious for a demon to be hiding something in Hell?"
15,13,CASTIEL,"I don't know. Sam and Dean, they're searching there now."
15,13,RUBY,"Oh, Sam. How is the big lug? I liked him. We had a good thing until he killed me."
15,13,CASTIEL,"Listen, I don't have a lot of time. Could we possibly just – W-When you went to Jo about the Occultum –"
15,13,RUBY,When I went to see her?
15,13,RUBY,Is this a trap? 'Cause I will mess you up.
15,13,SISTER JO,Wow. That's how much you trust me. Girlfriend –
15,13,RUBY,I'm not your girlfriend. What do you want?
15,13,SISTER JO,"Here's the deal. Lucifer and Michael are circling each other; there's gonna be a showdown. And I know you think you're in solid with Lucifer, but we both know if those two go at it, it's Apocalypse time, and nothing will be left standing."
15,13,RUBY,Maybe.
15,13,SISTER JO,"And maybe things go your way. But maybe they go Heaven's, and if they do, everyone will need a Plan B. Look, you and I work well together when we have to. You are a powerful demon, and I am a good businesswoman. When the smoke clears, there'll be a new world order. We can make that work for us."
15,13,RUBY,You said we'd all be dead.
15,13,SISTER JO,We don't have to be. Not if we ride it out in the safest place that exists.
15,13,RUBY,I'm not following.
15,13,SISTER JO,The Occultum.
15,13,CASTIEL,The Occultum is a place?
15,13,RUBY,"A place... a thing... Whatever you want to call it, it's powerful. Jo and I cut a deal, and I stashed it. I can tell you the location. And it's not in Hell."
15,13,CASTIEL,Does Jo know where it is? Because she might try to –
15,13,RUBY,"No. [Scoffs] That girl really can't be trusted, but you can trust me if..."
15,13,CASTIEL,If what?
15,13,RUBY,I'll help you on one condition. That you get me the Hell out of here.
15,13,CASTIEL,What?
15,13,JACK,Guys. You're back.
15,13,DEAN,Jack? What the Hell?
15,13,RUBY,"Why do they call this place the Empty? This place is full. It's full of sorrow and despair playing over and over again, of angels and demons dreaming about their regrets. Forever."
15,13,CASTIEL,"Yeah, I know."
15,13,JACK,He's dead. Kind of. For now.
15,13,SAM,What?
15,13,RUBY,"You're clearly connected, Castiel. Just try."
15,13,CASTIEL,"Okay, I'll try."
15,13,RUBY,"The Occultum, it's..."
15,13,JACK,"Cas went to the Empty. Hopefully. To find Ruby, hopefully, to find out where this Occultum thing is located. Hopefully."
15,13,SAM,"That's way too many ""hopefully's."""
15,13,DEAN,Bring him back now!
15,13,THE ENTITY,"Yo, Clarence. You got what you wanted. Now what? You think you're gonna just flit on home?"
15,13,CASTIEL,"Yes, because we have a deal."
15,13,THE ENTITY,"I know we have a deal, Feathers."
15,13,THE ENTITY,"You're not dead, yet. But for the time you're here, I can make you wish you were."
15,13,CASTIEL,You can't hurt me. Jack said we're on the same side. Against Chuck.
15,13,THE ENTITY,I'm on Death's side.
15,13,DEAN,"Come on, wake up, pal."
15,13,THE ENTITY,"When her plan works, I finally get to go back to sleep."
15,13,CASTIEL,That's what she promised? She can do that?
15,13,DEAN,"Come on, Cas. Come on."
15,13,THE ENTITY,"Funny thing about her plan, though... she didn't say anything about needing you. Baby, you can't just traipse in and out of here. It upsets the order of things."
15,13,DEAN,Cas!
15,13,THE ENTITY,"Chardonnay, Clarence? Oh, you're probably not in the mood."
15,13,CASTIEL,Aah!
15,13,THE ENTITY,See you soon.
15,13,CASTIEL,Oh. You made it back.
15,13,DEAN,"Yeah. And so did you. You're an idiot, by the way."
15,13,SAM,What if this hadn't worked?
15,13,CASTIEL,But it did. The Occultum was never in Hell.
15,13,SAM,"Yeah, we get that."
15,13,CASTIEL,The Occultum is apparently the safest place in the world. Jo was never gonna give that up.
15,13,DEAN,"It's a ""place""? So you saw Ruby."
15,13,CASTIEL,And I got the location. Am I still an idiot?
15,13,DEAN,"Well, yeah."
15,13,SAM,"Let's go, then."
15,13,JACK,Wait. What if Chuck checks in on us and sees what we're doing. Isn't it pretty much over?
15,13,SAM,"Yeah, it would be."
15,13,DEAN,Uh... I have a dumb idea.
15,13,DEAN,"If Chuck comes back and checks in on us, he's gonna look for us here in the bunker."
15,13,SAM,We don't know that.
15,13,DEAN,"Well, we don't know that. So Chuck would need to see us here in the bunker."
15,13,CASTIEL,Wait. So you want them to be you?
15,13,DEAN,"Well, it's not that hard. Me and Sam do it every day. So I'm thinking we open up a rift with a spell, kind of like we did with Apocalypse World. But we don't need archangel juice 'cause we're just trying to get them out of this in-between. I'm thinking Cas' grace would be enough."
15,13,SAM,Or it'll blast them away to another world.
15,13,DEAN,"Maybe. But it's better than leaving them here. [He says pointing at the wall where AU Sam and AU Dean are now playing rock, paper, scissors.]"
15,13,SAM,Koth. Munto. Nuntox.
15,13,SAM,"So, uh, back home, you're – you're Hunters?"
15,13,ALT!DEAN,The family business. But our world's probably gone. We made it out just before the explosion.
15,13,DEAN,That's God.
15,13,ALT!DEAN,God?
15,13,SAM,Yeah. You're gonna need another beer.
15,13,ALT!DEAN,We actually don't drink much of this stuff.
15,13,ALT!SAM,"Dad won't keep it in the house. He only likes his ""private-label Scotch."" He spoils us."
15,13,SAM,"Wait, your dad is... still around?"
15,13,DEAN,"And he ""spoils"" you?"
15,13,ALT!SAM,"Well, he did. We don't know where he is now. Uh, we all went through the rift together, but, uh, guess we got separated."
15,13,ALT!DEAN,Mm. To Dad.
15,13,ALT!SAM,Best guy ever.
15,13,ALT!SAM,"So, this is where you live."
15,13,SAM,"Yeah, yeah."
15,13,ALT!SAM,And this is where your Hunting operation is based?
15,13,SAM,"Uh, I mean, [Scoffs] it's not really much of an operation."
15,13,DEAN,"No, no, no. No, no, we – we – we do just fine. We, uh – [chuckles] We hunt monsters all over the country."
15,13,ALT!DEAN,"It's exhausting, isn't it?"
15,13,DEAN,Mm.
15,13,ALT!DEAN,But we – we do it worldwide. We have to keep two sets of pilots on standby.
15,13,SAM,You guys have your own plane?
15,13,ALT!SAM,"You don't? Oh, dear. How do you manage?"
15,13,SAM,How do you afford it?
15,13,ALT!DEAN,We get paid. For Hunting monsters.
15,13,DEAN,You what?
15,13,ALT!SAM,Yes. HunterCorp does very well.
15,13,SAM,HunterCorp?
15,13,ALT!DEAN,"Yeah. Well, got to hand it to the old man, huh? Pretty much built up an entire empire from scratch."
15,13,ALT!SAM,To Dad.
15,13,ALT!DEAN,Smartest guy ever.
15,13,ALT!DEAN,"Hmm. Alright. Uh, well, look, fellas, thanks again for the, uh – for the rescue."
15,13,DEAN,"Oh, uh, glad you brought that up. See, we got ourselves a bit of a situation here."
15,13,ALT!DEAN,Oh.
15,13,DEAN,God smashed your world like we said and...
15,13,SAM,And now he's gonna take out this one.
15,13,DEAN,And we're gonna stop him.
15,13,SAM,But he may be checking in on us here.
15,13,ALT!SAM,"Wait. God ""checks in"" on you?"
15,13,DEAN,"Yeah. Uh, we kind of have a... relationship. So if he decides to look in on us, we don't want him to know what we're doing. So you two are gonna be here, pretending to be us."
15,13,ALT!DEAN,And how do we do that?
15,13,SAM,"Well, first off, I'm sorry, you're gonna have to lose the man bun."
15,13,ALT!DEAN,Mm.
15,13,ALT!SAM,I will not.
15,13,DEAN,"Right. Uh, and then, uh..."
15,13,DEAN,This the place? You sure?
15,13,CASTIEL,Ruby was very specific.
15,13,DEAN,"Yeah, well, so was Jo."
15,13,JACK,"Guys, I-I know I haven't been doing this as long as you, but doesn't this seem a little easy?"
15,13,SAM,Yeah.
15,13,SAM,You hear something?
15,13,JACK,Is that a...bear?
15,13,SAM,No. It's more like a...
15,13,CASTIEL,Hellhounds.
15,13,SAM,"Dean. Dean, you want to hurry a little bit?"
15,13,SAM,"Go, go, go!"
15,13,DEAN,You got it?
15,13,SAM,[Straining] Yeah.
15,13,DEAN,Guess Ruby forgot to mention the freakin' Hellhounds.
15,13,CASTIEL,"Yeah, it would seem."
15,13,JACK,Where are we supposed to look?
15,13,CASTIEL,"She said the ""top of the cross"" would point the way."
15,13,DEAN,What's it supposed to be pointing to?
15,13,SAM,Guys! Could you maybe move it along?!
15,13,JACK,"Dean, Cas."
15,13,CASTIEL,The top of the cross... it's right there.
15,13,SAM,Guys! I can't hold 'em forever!
15,13,DEAN,The Hell is that? Is that a map?
15,13,CASTIEL,"Maybe it's a key. It's a passage in Enochian. It says, um, loosely translated, ""In order to be in the Occultum, the Occultum must be in you."""
15,13,ALT!DEAN,"They said lose the man bun, Samuel."
15,13,ALT!SAM,"Look, hillbilly clothes are bad enough. I have to draw the line somewhere, and my hair... is sacred. So, what do we do now?"
15,13,ALT!DEAN,"This is it. They said be authentic, drink beer in front of a computer screen."
15,13,ALT!SAM,That's their lives?
15,13,ALT!DEAN,Mm-hmm.
15,13,ALT!SAM,"[takes a sip of beer and reacts with disgust] Oh, my God."
15,13,ALT!DEAN,You get used to it.
15,13,ALT!SAM,[Scoffs]
15,13,ALT!DEAN,[finds Busty Asian Beauties dot com] Whoa!
15,13,ALT!DEAN,[Chuckles and turns the computer to show Sam] Check this out. And there's like a ton of these files in here.
15,13,ALT!SAM,"Can you imagine if Dad caught us with that kind of stuff? Goodbye, trust funds."
15,13,ALT!DEAN,Wow.
15,13,ALT!DEAN,"I got to tell you, Sammy, this Sam and Dean, you know, sure they're simple, but they've got this place of their own. There's no quarterly reports, there's no investor calls, there's just – there's nothing to do but hunt monsters, drink beer, and watch porn."
15,13,ALT!SAM,Yeah!
15,13,ALT!DEAN,They've got it made.
15,13,DEAN,"Guys, I don't like it, alright? I mean, first Jo sets us up with the – with killer demons, and now Ruby sends us to a place with Hellhounds? These chicks want us dead. I don't trust any part of this. [he turns to Jack] Where's the thing?"
15,13,JACK,"Um, I ate it."
15,13,DEAN,You what?
15,13,JACK,"Well, it said it had to be in me, so –"
15,13,DEAN,No! Spit it out.
15,13,JACK,It's fine. Okay? Nothing's happening.
15,13,JACK,Aah!
15,13,DEAN,Jack?
15,13,CASTIEL,Jack?
15,13,DEAN,Jack?
15,13,THE GIRL,You must not be human. Humans may not enter here. Are you an angel?
15,13,JACK,"Um, it's a long story. Why do humans have to stay out?"
15,13,THE GIRL,This is the Garden. Man's beginning.
15,13,JACK,You mean...Eden. Like Adam and Eve?
15,13,THE GIRL,"God loved them so. His prize creations, until he banished them and all of mankind from the perfection of the Garden. And he hid it away."
15,13,JACK,I was told this place might change me somehow.
15,13,THE GIRL,Perhaps. If you were the one meant to find it. You'll know soon enough.
15,13,DEAN,What do you mean if Jack comes back?
15,13,CASTIEL,"I don't know what's happening here. I-I had no idea this was gonna involve ingesting some magic sphere and then disappearing, Dean."
15,13,SNAKE,"Who are you, really? Who are you meant to be?"
15,13,DEAN,The Hell?
15,13,SAM,Jack.
15,13,DEAN,Jack? Hey. You okay?
15,13,DEAN,"Alright, fellas. Well, thanks for your help. Now it's, uh, time to go."
15,13,ALT!DEAN,"You know, we, uh – we could just all live here together."
15,13,ALT!SAM,Like a club.
15,13,DEAN,That would just be weird.
15,13,ALT!DEAN,It wouldn't be so weird.
15,13,DEAN,"Trust me, where you want to be is Brazil, okay? It's far away, and there's nothing but beaches, babes, carnival."
15,13,ALT!DEAN,"Oh, uh, you think we could keep the flannel shirts?"
15,13,DEAN,No. Okay.
15,13,ALT!DEAN,"Oh, uh, when we were looking around, we, uh – we saw it."
15,13,DEAN,"""It""?"
15,13,ALT!DEAN,The car.
15,13,DEAN,You didn't touch it.
15,13,ALT!SAM,Oh. [Chuckles] We drove in it.
15,13,DEAN,"I'm sorry, you what?"
15,13,AU!DEAN,And we're leaving.
15,13,AU!SAM,Ow! My arm – you're hurting it.
15,13,AU!DEAN,Sam.
15,13,AU!SAM,Dean.
15,13,DEAN [angrily],Have fun in Rio!
15,13,DEAN,Is the kid okay?
15,13,SAM,I don't know.
15,13,CASTIEL,He seems to have recovered.
15,13,DEAN,"So, Jack's back?"
15,13,CASTIEL,"Yeah, he is. But, um, something's different. Jack is, uh – well, he's been to the Garden. That's the crossroads of divinity and humanity. No one's been there since the exile till now. Till Jack."
15,13,SAM,"Hey, Jack. How you doing?"
15,13,JACK,I... I'm so sorry.
15,13,DEAN,You what?
15,13,JACK,"Why didn't I get it? I mean, my mother died, too. Why didn't I understand? It was my fault."
15,13,DEAN,Jack...
15,13,CASTIEL,His soul is back.
15,13,JACK,Please. Just please forgive me.
15,15,GIRL,She's making it weird.
15,15,SYLVIA,She's still one of God's—
15,15,GIRL,"Just, maybe she should eat outside? Away from, like, people."
15,15,CONNOR,Right?
15,15,PASTOR,"Where you going, brother?"
15,15,CONNOR,We have house rules about being clean to eat here.
15,15,CONNOR,"Yes. We have spirit, Pastor."
15,15,VOICE,"Hey, Connor! Connor!
Connor looks to his right, into another street. That's where the voice is coming from."
15,15,"MAN:
Connor!","Connor turns around, startled. Nobody to be seen. He starts walking backwards. He trips over a teddy bear and falls to the ground, hitting his head."
15,15,"CONNOR:
Ah.","He exhales sharply. He sits up, grunting. His gaze falls onto the teddy bear and he picks it up."
15,15,TEDDY BEAR,"Hey, Connor."
15,15,DEAN,"Hey, you got anything?"
15,15,DEAN,"Yeah, check this out. Last night, power goes out in Atlantic City."
15,15,SAM,So...?
15,15,SAM,And you think...?
15,15,SAM,How's that important?
15,15,DEAN,Chuck said Amara loves keno.
15,15,DEAN,He's not that funny.
15,15,DEAN,She's a player.
15,15,SAM,"It's weak.
Dean nods slightly."
15,15,DEAN,"Well, right now, weak is all we have, okay, 'cause nobody's found anything. And without Amara, we're screwed. So, Atlantic City? All-you-can-eat prime rib, and possibly one all-powerful cosmic being. Come on, man, sounds like a roadtrip to me."
15,15,SAM,Cas.
15,15,DEAN,"Hey, right on time."
15,15,CASTIEL,"Well, I should go with you."
15,15,SAM,"Cas, it's probably nothing."
15,15,CASTIEL,"Uh, so I'm, what, supposed to just sit here?"
15,15,DEAN,"Well, somebody's got to keep an eye on Jack in case Billie shows up for his, uh, thing."
15,15,CASTIEL,"Right, while you track down one of the most powerful beings in existence and lie to her face."
15,15,DEAN,Exactly.
15,15,CASTIEL,"Dean, Amara's dangerous. You can't just charge in."
15,15,DEAN,"We're not, okay? Plus, you know, she and I used to have a thing, so..."
15,15,Bunker Library.,"Jack is sitting at Sam's laptop. Dean, Sam, and Castiel return."
15,15,JACK,"Sam, what's this case about?"
15,15,SAM,"I wouldn't worry about it. It's, uh, not our kind of thing."
15,15,DEAN,You sure it's  it's nothing spooky?
15,15,SAM,"I mean, a kid got killed. It's tragic, obviously, but the local cops can handle it."
15,15,DEAN,Great. But you know what? Why don't you and Cas go run it down just to be sure?
15,15,JACK,Really?
15,15,CASTIEL,What?
15,15,DEAN,"Yeah, you said you didn't want to sit around here, and after the whole Mrs. Butters thing..."
15,15,CASTIEL,Mrs. What?
15,15,DEAN,"Just get out there, you know, stay busy."
15,15,CASTIEL,With a murder investigation?
15,15,DEAN,Yeah.
15,15,CASTIEL,Sam?
15,15,SAM,"Dean's not wrong. And, look, this case, uh, maybe you can help."
15,15,DEAN,"Alright, well, you guys go ""Highway to Heaven"" that bitch."
15,15,JACK,I'll get my suit. Can we wear matching ties?
15,15,CASTIEL,Yeah. Blue's a good color on you.
15,15,Alley.,A police car is parked in the alley in which Connor was killed. A police woman is getting out of the car. Castiel and Jack are walking towards her.
15,15,POLICE WOMAN,"Great, you found it. Which one did I talk to on the phone?"
15,15,CASTIEL,"And this is, uh"
15,15,POLICE WOMAN,"In the field long, Lovato? You look greener than Baby Yoda."
15,15,CASTIEL,"He's a very smart, very, uh, pale young man."
15,15,POLICE WOMAN,"Uhhuh. Well, we're standing in what I call the trap zone. The victim was first attacked here."
15,15,JACK,Did anybody find any tiny bags with chicken bones inside?
15,15,JACK,Or feel cold?
15,15,POLICE WOMAN,"I don't  uh, look, none of that. But, there was a message. The kid, Connor, someone wrote the word ""liar"" on his body. Sort of carved it in."
15,15,CASTIEL,I see.
15,15,POLICE WOMAN,Whoever did this worked him over good. Cut off each finger one by one. Shoved it down his throat.
15,15,POLICE WOMAN,And we found this.
15,15,JACK,"Marvelous Marvin, the Talking Teddy, I have one."
15,15,JACK,"Uh, for my stepson. Ronald."
15,15,POLICE WOMAN,"Right. Well, the toy, it's got a speaker in it, and we found another one in a fake rock over there."
15,15,CASTIEL,How strange.
15,15,POLICE WOMAN,Gets stranger. We caught this off of one of the security cameras across the street.
15,15,CASTIEL,Is that a mask?
15,15,POLICE WOMAN,Think someone's seen too many bad slasher flicks.
15,15,CASTIEL,This is all very horrific.
15,15,JACK,Almost demonic.
15,15,Crossroad.,Castiel is digging a hole at a crossroad while Jack is sitting on the backend of the truck with a tablet.
15,15,CASTIEL,"Well, if this is a demon, I know how to get answers."
15,15,CASTIEL,What are you doing?
15,15,CASTIEL,"Oh, yeah. I did that once."
15,15,CASTIEL,"There were so many cat photos, it was just... There were too many cats."
15,15,CASTIEL,Someone should be here.
15,15,JACK,It says I need a parent or guardian's permission to join.
15,15,CASTIEL,You have my permission.
15,15,JACK,Ah.
15,15,JACK,I have his permission.
15,15,ZACK,"Sorry, lads. Shop's closed. No more deals."
15,15,CASTIEL,We don't want to make a deal.
15,15,ZACK,"Do tell. So, how can Zack be of service?"
15,15,JACK,Why is he talking like that?
15,15,CASTIEL,I don't know.
15,15,ZACK,Because Zack has style.
15,15,JACK,Who killed that boy in the alley downtown?
15,15,CASTIEL,Was it a demon? Was it you?
15,15,ZACK,"No, and..."
15,15,ZACK,"Wait, are are angels solving people crimes now? Like ""Highway to Heaven"" but with murder or something? Because I would watch that show."
15,15,JACK,"Right. If you didn't do it, do you know who did?"
15,15,ZACK,"No. I admire their work, but it's got nothing to do with us. Just some wacko. Humans, am I right?"
15,15,CASTIEL,So no one made a deal?
15,15,CASTIEL,You're a deviant soul corrupted by Hell.
15,15,ZACK,"Well, yeah, yes, but II mean more in, like, a worklifebalance sense."
15,15,CASTIEL,Okay. We should go.
15,15,ZACK,"No, wait, wait. Um, IIII could help. Do you need a driver, or...?"
15,15,ZACK,Come one. I'm bored out of my mind.
15,15,ZACK,"No, guys, guys."
15,15,JACK,"Sam was right. It's not a monster.
Jack puts the shovel into the back of the truck."
15,15,CASTIEL,"Well, he has half right. Sometimes humans can be the worst kind of monsters."
15,15,JACK,"Yeah, but it's kind of not our thing. Guess we should just go back to the bunker and do nothing while we wait for Sam and Dean.
He looks disappointed."
15,15,VOICE,Valerie!
15,15,VOICE,"Valerie, over here!"
15,15,VOICE,Valerie.
15,15,DEAN,"So Rowena's got Hell on lockdown, huh?"
15,15,CASTIEL,"Yeah, it would appear so."
15,15,DEAN,"Well, about time somebody took charge."
15,15,SAM,"Hey, how's Jack?"
15,15,CASTIEL,Focused.
15,15,DEAN,"Well, that's good."
15,15,CASTIEL,"We were with the police earlier. Another woman has gone missing. Apparently, she and Connor were from the same church group."
15,15,SAM,Sounds like a real lead.
15,15,DEAN,"Okay, well, hey, uh, just, you know, be careful with those hallelujah types. I mean, most play it straight, but there's some that think that every Fed is Deep State. If I were you, I would divide and conquer. Have Jack drink the KoolAid and sign up. You go in flashing a badge, you know?"
15,15,CASTIEL,"Okay, I understand. How's the search for Amara?"
15,15,DEAN,"Well, it's dandy. We'll talk to you later."
15,15,SAM,"Hey, you sure about this?"
15,15,DEAN,"Hey, man, like I said  we don't find her, casino buffet. Pretty good consolation prize."
15,15,SAM,"That's not what I meant. We've been on the road for almost two days, and I get not wanting to talk about it, I do, but, you know, what we're planning on doing, killing Amara."
15,15,DEAN,"Well, we're not pulling the trigger."
15,15,SAM,"Sure, but we still have to find her. And then, if we find her, we have to lie to her. We got to set her up for her own death."
15,15,DEAN,"Hey, man, Billie called us ""Messengers of God's Destruction,"" okay? Did you think that was, what, gonna be easy? Bloodless? Mhmh. We knew there was gonna be a catch. Least this time it's not you or me."
15,15,PASTOR,"Thank you, Mitch. That was a moving testimony. We all feel Connor's absence in our heart right now, and we hope to see him again when God calls us to him on the last day."
15,15,PASTOR,We dedicate today's charity service to his memory.
15,15,JACK,Hello.
15,15,JACK,Where can I find the KoolAid?
15,15,SYLVIA,What?
15,15,JACK,"I'm sorry. I mean, I want to join. To help. My name's Jack."
15,15,SYLVIA,Okay.
15,15,SYLVIA,Fill this out.
15,15,JACK,Is that the pastor? What's going on?
15,15,SYLVIA,It was a prayer dedication for... One of our members just passed away.
15,15,JACK,Were you close?
15,15,SYLVIA,Come find me when you're done with the form.
15,15,CASTIEL,Hey.
15,15,JACK,That way.
15,15,PASTOR,"...bigger picture. Even in the darkest hour, our light is waiting to guide us."
15,15,PASTOR,Can I pray for you?
15,15,PASTOR,"Father God, watch over your child. Bless him with your grace, your love, and your guidance. Amen."
15,15,MITCH,"Thank you, Pastor."
15,15,PASTOR,You look like you have a question.
15,15,CASTIEL,I have some disturbing news about an employee of yours.
15,15,PASTOR,If this is about Connor–
15,15,CASTIEL,"No, it's not. Valerie Jones never made it home last night."
15,15,Storage room.,"Valerie is tied to a chair and gagged, a weird contraption hovering over her fingers. It's probably there to cut off her fingers one by one."
15,15,GIRL,New guy's hot.
15,15,GIRL,What? I have eyes.
15,15,JACK,I'm all done with the paperwork. Now what?
15,15,GIRL,You can work with me.
15,15,SYLVIA,"People come her from all walks of life. Make sure you look them in the eyes, give them a smile."
15,15,GIRL,Then hand them a bagged lunch and a water.
15,15,GIRL,Thank you. Next.
15,15,GIRL,"We used to give out Bibles, but we stopped."
15,15,JACK,"Oh. What I said earlier, about Connor..."
15,15,SYLVIA,Excuse me.
15,15,JACK,I'm  I'm sorry. I didn't want to upset you.
15,15,JACK,I'm no good at this.
15,15,SYLVIA,"You're okay. It's just, uh, you were right. Connor and I, we... dated, years ago... sort of. More like we watched a lot of old movies together."
15,15,SYLVIA,We were kids. He was always there for me.
15,15,JACK,My mother.
15,15,"SYLVIA:
Yeah?",Jack nods.
15,15,SYLVIA,"I, uh... My mom died three years ago. Now it's just me and Pastor Joe."
15,15,JACK,The – the pastor is your father?
15,15,SYLVIA,"He's a better preacher than he is a dad, but, yeah."
15,15,JACK,"Well, I have more dads than most, and I always just feel like I'm letting all of them down."
15,15,SYLVIA,"I've been there. You're sweet, Jack. Put your trust in God, not people."
15,15,Pastor's Office.,Castiel is sitting in the Pastor's office with the Pastor.
15,15,PASTOR,I don't believe in coincidences. Maybe we're being targeted.
15,15,CASTIEL,Who would target this church?
15,15,PASTOR,We don't call it that here. People have a lot of baggage with that word. We're a faith-based community.
15,15,CASTIEL,"I see. Um, has anyone else from this faith-based community gone missing?"
15,15,PASTOR,"No, not missing, but people come and go all the time."
15,15,CASTIEL,Like who?
15,15,PASTOR,"I don't know. Um, Brother Rudy, for instance. He handled most of our A.V. and tech. We recently parted ways."
15,15,PASTOR,"Uh, no. He just wanted to worship somewhere else."
15,15,SYLVIA,"Dad, do you have a sec?"
15,15,PASTOR,In a minute. I'm with someone.
15,15,PASTOR,In a minute.
15,15,PASTOR,You have kids?
15,15,CASTIEL,"I, uh... It's complicated."
15,15,PASTOR,"It always is. Anyway, whatever I can do to help, let me know."
15,15,CASTIEL,Okay.
15,15,CASTIEL,"You really care about these people, don't you?"
15,15,PASTOR,"It's kind of part of the job. My wife, she grew up in this church and loved it. They were a bit more hardcore back then. Chalked everything that happened up to God's will. Never seemed to realize that–"
15,15,CASTIEL,God just doesn't care.
15,15,PASTOR,I was gonna say that we all have to take care of each other.
15,15,CASTIEL,Right.
15,15,PASTOR,"Anyway, I sold the building, moved us here, started to preach a gospel of love and service to our neighbors. Now, as long as people are willing to help as much as they can, all faiths and backgrounds are welcome."
15,15,CASTIEL,"What do you mean by, um, backgrounds?"
15,15,PASTOR,Connor didn't have to live in fear of who he was. A gay man who believed in a tolerant God.
15,15,CASTIEL,"Well, I imagine not everyone was happy with the change."
15,15,PASTOR,Not by a mile. But it doesn't matter. A saint is a sinner who keeps trying.
15,15,SAM,Not going in for a snack?
15,15,DEAN,Saving room. I got four hours till all-you-can-eat. I have a process.
15,15,SAM,"Ooh, can your process last for six hours? Lane closures  I76."
15,15,DEAN,Damn it!
15,15,SAM,Pork rinds?
15,15,AMARA,You headed somewhere fun?
15,15,DEAN,"Well, we were headed to you, actually."
15,15,SAM,How'd you find us?
15,15,DEAN,Thank you.
15,15,AMARA,And I got wind of your friend Castiel's angelic APB. I knew you were looking for me.
15,15,SAM,Yeah.
15,15,DEAN,Pierogis?
15,15,AMARA,"You're hungry, I'm hungry. I like new, Earthly experiences, and I have never had a Pennsylvania pierogi."
15,15,Storage room.,Back in the storage room with Valerie. The countdown clock is beeping. The TV shows that it's almost over. The clock hits zero and the contraption cuts off another one of Valerie's fingers. Valerie screams again.
15,15,PASTOR,Jesus. Allah. Yahweh. Buddha. Krishna. Gaeia. The Four Winds.
15,15,PASTOR,"God, you go by so many names. But it doesn't matter what we call you. It matters how we live. Come be among us as we provide for those less fortunate. And please help us in welcoming our newest friend, Jack."
15,15,EVERYONE,Welcome.
15,15,JACK,Hello.
15,15,PASTOR,"It's custom here that someone give testimony during prayer. Jack, as the newest member of Patchwork, I invite you to share your journey."
15,15,JACK,I... Um...
15,15,PASTOR,Please.
15,15,CASTIEL,"My name is, um  well, my name's not important. I do know what blind faith is. I used to just follow orders without question, and I did some pretty terrible things. I would never look beyond the plan. And then, of course, when it all came crashing down, I found myself lost. I didn't know what my purpose was anymore. And then one day, something changed, something amazing. I... I guess I found a family, and I became a father. And in that, I rediscovered my faith. I rediscovered who I am."
15,15,PASTOR,I hope I didn't put you on the spot earlier.
15,15,JACK,"How'd you do it, bring all these people together with so many different ideas about religion?"
15,15,PASTOR,It's not about what they believe. It's about what they do. I tell them to leave the rest at the door.
15,15,JACK,You make it sound so easy.
15,15,PASTOR,"I always say, people are God's hands, each of us a finger for him to use. To lift each other up."
15,15,JACK,Who could have done this?
15,15,PASTOR,I don't know.
15,15,CASTIEL,I do.
15,15,Pavel's Deli.,Oldie's music is playing. Amara is getting her Pierogis.
15,15,DEAN,"We want to take your brother down, and we need your help."
15,15,AMARA,What makes you think I'd do that?
15,15,DEAN,Because you've got beef with him – past and present.
15,15,SAM,"Amara, I saw into Chuck's mind. His memories. He asked you for help."
15,15,AMARA,Refusing to help him isn't the same as betraying him.
15,15,DEAN,"You know what he's been up to the past couple of months? Snuffing out universes, one after the other?"
15,15,AMARA,I know. I can feel it. He's very nearly done with the others.
15,15,DEAN,And you don't care?
15,15,AMARA,It doesn't matter. There's nothing you two can do.
15,15,AMARA,No.
15,15,DEAN,No?
15,15,AMARA,No. I won't betray him like that.
15,15,DEAN,"Why? I mean, I get he's your brother, but–"
15,15,AMARA,"Ugh, apologies, Dean, but you don't get anything. You see me sitting across from you. You see a woman. You see Chuck as a squirrelly weirdo. But you can't imagine what we really are. We came into existence together. We are the same."
15,15,SAM,"The former Death, he told us you were the firstborn."
15,15,AMARA,"Or he told you what you needed to hear. Chuck and I, we're twins. Creation and destruction, light and dark, balance. And when we split apart, all this was created."
15,15,SAM,The Big Bang?
15,15,AMARA,Eh.
15,15,DEAN,When you split? So when... When he threw you in a cage. When he betrayed you. When he trapped you for an eternity.
15,15,JACK,"Ah.
Castiel enters after him."
15,15,CASTIEL,"Brother Rudy left the congregation, the pastor said. It was amicable, but–"
15,15,JACK,Maybe that was a bad lie.
15,15,CASTIEL,"And he was good with computers, so..."
15,15,CASTIEL,He's been dead a long time.
15,15,Pavel's Deli.,"We see Amara through the window, getting the check. She is alone. Dean and Sam are watching her from the Impala. Dean starts the engine. Sam sighs."
15,15,SAM,"You know, maybe it's for the better."
15,15,SAM,What's going on? What are you doing?
15,15,DEAN,Wait her. I'm gonna ask her something.
15,15,DEAN,Why?
15,15,AMARA,"I told you, Dean, he's my–"
15,15,DEAN,"No, no. No. Why did you bring her back? You said that you wanted to show me something, that you wanted to, uh  to teach me something. I don't know if you were following along, but your little experiment, it came to a not-so-happy ending. My mom is dead. So what exactly did you want to show me? What was the point?"
15,15,AMARA,"I wanted two things for you, Dean. I wanted you to see that your mother was just a person, that the myth you'd held onto for so long of a better life, a life where she lived, was just that, a myth. I wanted you to see that the real, complicated Mary was better than your childhood dream because she was real. That now is always better than then. That you could finally start to accept your life."
15,15,DEAN,And the second thing?
15,15,AMARA,"I thought having her back would release you, put that fire out. Your anger. But I guess we both know I failed at that."
15,15,DEAN,You're damn right. Look at you. Just another cosmic dick rigging the game. You're just like your brother.
15,15,AMARA,"It was a gift, Dean, not a trial."
15,15,DEAN,"I'm not angry, Amara. I'm furious. To know that all my life, I've been nothing but a hamster in a wheel, stuck in a story. And you know whose fault that is? Chuck's. And it ain't just me. We're all trapped. Sam and Cas and Jack and even you. And you want to talk about the people that he's killing right now"
15,15,AMARA,Stop.
15,15,DEAN,"Why? He's not stopping. And you're doing nothing to stop it. Think he gives a rat's ass about you? Well, now who's living in a dreamworld?"
15,15,AMARA,Can I... trust you?
15,15,DEAN,I would never hurt you.
15,15,AMARA,Then... I-I'll think about it.
15,15,GIRL,Your dad's freaking out.
15,15,SYLVIA,Did he call the police?
15,15,GIRL,"No. The FBI guys told him not to. But I posted something about it, and my feed is going bananas. So many frowny faces."
15,15,GIRL,This is so crazy. Can you even believe it?
15,15,SYLVIA,I believe.
15,15,SYLVIA,You never did.
15,15,Later.,"The Pastor is pushing a cloth on the girl's wound. The girl is breathing heavily, crying."
15,15,PASTOR,"Easy, easy. Just hold on. We've called 911."
15,15,GIRL,She's here. It's Sylvia – the storage room.
15,15,CASTIEL,Excuse me. Excuse me.
15,15,PASTOR,You're gonna be okay.
15,15,CASTIEL,"Jack, follow him."
15,15,CASTIEL,Let me.
15,15,PASTOR,"Oh, dear God."
15,15,PASTOR,Sylvia–
15,15,SYLVIA,Shut up.
15,15,PASTOR,Let me help you.
15,15,SYLVIA,Like you helped Mom?
15,15,PASTOR,"Your mother was sick. She wouldn't even go to the doctor. She said, ""Put your trust in God."""
15,15,SYLVIA,And he called her home. And you made fun of her for that.
15,15,PASTOR,"No, I didn't."
15,15,SYLVIA,"You changed everything. Those people in there, they don't worship God. They worship you."
15,15,PASTOR,Please don't do this.
15,15,JACK,Let him go.
15,15,JACK,I know you're in pain. I can – I can feel it. Just let me help you.
15,15,SYLVIA,Everyone's trying to help me. Who are you? You're nothing. You're just a scared little boy trying to make your daddies happy.
15,15,SYLVIA,What?
15,15,PASTOR,Don't hurt her!
15,15,CASTIEL,Sleep.
15,15,CASTIEL,Go get the police. Go!
15,15,PASTOR,What are you?
15,15,PASTOR,You're an angel?
15,15,CASTIEL,"Well, not a very good one."
15,15,JACK,What's going to happen to her?
15,15,PASTOR,"I don't know, but she won't be alone."
15,15,PASTOR,"Whatever she needs, whatever it takes, I'll find a place where she can get help. I spent my life taking care of all these other people. Should've been taking care of her."
15,15,CASTIEL,"Hey, Jack. When Pastor Joe asked you to speak, you were struggling. Was it, um, something – something you were afraid to say? You know, what you're doing, you*re shouldering a great burden. You don't have to do it alone."
15,15,JACK,Yes... I do.
15,15,JACK,I've been lying to you.
15,15,CASTIEL,Lying about what?
15,15,JACK,...I'm gonna die.
15,15,JACK,"When we – When I kill Chuck and Amara, I'll die, too."
15,15,CASTIEL,What?
15,15,JACK,"Billie's spells have been turning me into some kind of bomb, and when I go off, God and Amara will cease to exist. And... I won't survive."
15,15,JACK,Don't tell Sam and Dean.
15,15,CASTIEL,"Oh, yeah? Why not?"
15,15,JACK,They won't understand. But I know... This is the only way they'll ever forgive me.
15,15,CASTIEL,"No. I watched you die once, and I will not do it again."
15,15,JACK,It's not your choice.
15,15,DEAN,There you are.
15,15,DEAN,Cas?
15,15,DEAN,"Hey, where you going? Where's Jack?"
15,15,CASTIEL,He's in his room. We got back. We didn't want to wake you up.
15,15,DEAN,"Nah, I wasn't asleep. How'd the case go?"
15,15,CASTIEL,"Oh, it went. Uh, we solved it, saved some people. Amara?"
15,15,DEAN,Yeah. Yeah we got her. I think she's on board.
15,15,CASTIEL,Good.
15,15,DEAN,Wait. What's happening? Where are you going?
15,15,CASTIEL,Going to look for another way. I have to.
15,15,DEAN,What the hell are you talking about?
15,15,CASTIEL,"Dean, in case something goes wrong and I don't make it back, there's something you and Sam need to know…"
15,15,CASTIEL,"This lie, it won't hurt them. It won't... It won't cause them pain or sadness. Sam and Dean taught me that some lies are necessary."
15,16,MRS. BUTTERS,It's an interdimensional geoscope.
15,16,DEAN,I looked in it earlier. I didn't see anything.
15,16,MRS. BUTTERS,"Oh, that's not good."
15,16,DEAN,"All my life, I've been nothing but a hamster in a wheel. Stuck in a story. And you know whose fault that is?  Chuck's."
15,16,SAM,Chuck is deleting worlds.  Jack... he's...
15,16,DEAN,a mess.
15,16,SAM,Yeah.
15,16,JACK,"I have a job, a mission! I'm supposed to kill God.  Do you really think I can do this?"
15,16,SAM,"Jack, you're the only one who can."
15,16,SAM,I don't know. Feels like Jack is hiding something.
15,16,JACK,"I've been lying to you. Billie's spells have been turning me into some kind of bomb, and when I go off and kill Chuck and Amara, I'll die, too."
15,16,CAS,Going to look for another way.
15,16,DEAN,What the hell are you talking about?
15,16,CAS,There's something you and Sam need to know.
15,16,MOTEL CLERK,"Mister... ""Travis Johnson""?"
15,16,TRAVIS,That's me.
15,16,TRAVIS,Yeah. Uh... sorry.
15,16,CLERK,"And, um, you had a special request? Room 214?"
15,16,TRAVIS,Yeah. Doctor's orders.
15,16,CLERK,You been here before?
15,16,TRAVIS,Long time ago.
15,16,CLERK,Mm. Welcome back.
15,16,TRAVIS,Just one night. And then it's over. It wasn't real. It was never... real.
15,16,CHILD,Do you remember me?
15,16,TRAVIS,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
15,16,CHILD,I remember you.
15,16,TRAVIS,You're not real. You were never real.
15,16,CHILD,Boo.
15,16,DEAN,How much longer?
15,16,SAM,Uh... seven hours.
15,16,DEAN,Ugh.
15,16,SAM,Yep.
15,16,DEAN,Can't believe we're going back here.
15,16,SAM,Travis was a friend.
15,16,DEAN,"Yeah, I know. I'm not saying what happened isn't sad. You know, I mean, the guy slit his throat with a whiskey bottle, but... He's an old friend, you know? Old, old. Like haven't seen him in 25 years. We've missed funerals for much closer friends... Hunters."
15,16,SAM,"Well, this is different. I-I mean, it's not like we have much else to do. Chuck is off world. Jack's in the bunker, waiting for Billie's orders. And... And Cas just... bailed, I guess. He didn't say anything to you about why he left?"
15,16,DEAN,Not really.
15,16,SAM,And you guys didn't get into a fight or something?
15,16,DEAN,It's just Cas being Cas.
15,16,SAM,Right.
15,16,SAM,"Seriously, Dean? You know how many people die every year texting and driving?"
15,16,DEAN,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I know. Look. [Dean puts his phone away] Okay? Done. You're right. My bad."
15,16,DEAN,It looks smaller.
15,16,SAM,"Yeah, well, we're bigger. Weird being back here."
15,16,DEAN,"Yeah, it's not exactly on the top of my bucket list."
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Dad should've let me go with him. I mean, you don't need me. I was babysitting you when I was your age."
15,16,YOUNG SAM,I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Whatever. Uh, wanna practice shooting?"
15,16,YOUNG SAM,I just want to go to the room.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Naw, let's... let's hit a vending machine or something. What's that?"
15,16,YOUNG SAM,Nothing.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,Let me see.
15,16,YOUNG SAM,"Dude, stop!"
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,Ahh. Victory. [he discovers it's a 1991 American College Guide book] These better be haunted colleges. Where'd you even get this?
15,16,YOUNG SAM,The bookshelf at the last motel.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,I thought your imaginary friend told you it was bad to steal. Why would you want... Wait. You think you're gonna go to college?
15,16,YOUNG SAM,Yeah. Why not?
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"""Why not?"" Why?"
15,16,YOUNG SAM,'Cause that's what normal people do.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Right. Because we are normal. Whatever. We barely go to school. So if you think places like that'll even think about letting a dumbass like you in... Come on. This, Sammy? This is our life."
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,Hello.
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Freeze! You're under arrest.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,Uh...
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,"Relax. I won't rat on you... if you teach me that trick. This is my little brother, Travis."
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Hey, kid. I'm Dean."
15,16,YOUNG TRAVIS,Hi.
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,I'm Caitlin.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Oh. These old models, they're easy. One, two... three."
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Thanks.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"So, uh, you staying here?"
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Our mom works here... cleaning crew. We saw your car when you checked in. Who's your dad... Knight Rider?
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"What? No. My dad drives an Impala, which is badass. KITT's a crappy..."
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. Yeah. I know.
15,16,CAITLIN,Dean.
15,16,DEAN,Hey.
15,16,CAITLIN,Hey. Sam. Thanks for coming.
15,16,SAM,"Yeah. Sorry, um... you know, about your brother."
15,16,CAITLIN,Yeah.
15,16,SAM,How you holding up?
15,16,CAITLIN,"Crying a lot. Blaming myself a lot. Long story. Travis, he... After you left, he had a pretty rocky life. Drugs, couldn't hold down a job. I encouraged him to get help for years. Finally, he took my advice. Started therapy. It was great at first. It... It really seemed to be helping, and then..."
15,16,SAM,Then...?
15,16,CAITLIN,"His doctor started prying. About that winter... what happened here. Travis said he needed to face his fears. His doc called it ""immersion therapy."" To heal. He checked in to room 214."
15,16,SAM,214? Is that where he...?
15,16,DEAN,"Well, look, whatever you need us for, we're here, okay? Help with the funeral..."
15,16,CAITLIN,The funeral was last week.
15,16,DEAN,What?
15,16,SAM,I'm sorry. I thought you said...
15,16,CAITLIN,I know. I'm sorry. I needed to be sure that you would come.
15,16,DEAN,Come for what?
15,16,SAM,Caitlin... Why do you want us here?
15,16,CAITLIN,"I think she's back. You remember that winter, how it started. She came for Travis first."
15,16,YOUNG TRAVIS,"One, two... three."
15,16,YOUNG TRAVIS,"Caitlin! Help! Caitlin, help! Help me!"
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Travis?!
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"You okay, kid?"
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Travis? What happened?
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,What... Hey.
15,16,DEAN,"Well, the coroner's report is open and shut. Travis's fingerprints were all over the broken glass."
15,16,CAITLIN,"I know how this seems... How I seem. But my brother, he wouldn't have killed himself."
15,16,SAM,"Well, I know they cleaned the place out already, but I looked everywhere. No symbols, no hex bags, nothing that's... our kinda thing."
15,16,DEAN,"Caitlin, I know it's hard, okay? But you said it yourself... that this ""immersion"" therapy was making things worse. Maybe coming here... sent him over the edge."
15,16,YOUNG TRAVIS,I'm crazy. You think I'm crazy!
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,No! It's just... I didn't see anything.
15,16,YOUNG TRAVIS,But I did!
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Wait. You called your dad? Why?
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Because y... You say you saw a monster, right? I believe you."
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,You do?
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Monsters are real. Me, my dad... we hunt them. It's, uh, kind of the family business."
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,That's... Are you for real?
15,16,YOUNG SAM,Yeah. He is.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Can you tell us, um... anything else weird going on? In this hotel, in town? Other people seeing things?"
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,This first one was a couple months ago. Town looked for days. They never found him. Second one was just a few weeks later. And then a third... just last week.
15,16,DEAN,"I'm sorry, Caitlin, but that thing, it's not here."
15,16,CAITLIN,"You've changed. Back then, you believed him, even before I did."
15,16,DEAN,"Well, this is different."
15,16,SAM,"Uh, Dean, we don't know what happened."
15,16,DEAN,The thing preys on kids... only kids. Are there any missing or dead kids in town?
15,16,CAITLIN,No.
15,16,DEAN,"Right. I know it's hard. But that has to be what happened, because that other thing, I killed it. I'm sorry."
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,It's secure. Grab a paper.
15,16,YOUNG SAM,Yeah. I got that.
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,What are we looking for?
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,Anything that might help.
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,"Okay. Like this? ""9-year-old Britta went missing from the gas station""?"
15,16,YOUNG SAM,"Main and Genesee... we... we stopped there on our way into town. And then, Travis was attacked here, at the motel."
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,Any other locations?
15,16,YOUNG SAM,"Um, Retsof Road and Main."
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Castagna Lane and Genesee.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Sam, anything close to all those places?"
15,16,YOUNG SAM,Not really. The Wadsworth Cannery?
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,That place? It's abandoned.
15,16,YOUNG SAM,Where are you going? We don't even know what this thing is yet.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,Got a gun. Got a knife. I'm good.
15,16,YOUNG SAM,Dad wouldn't like this.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,Dad's not here. And he'd want me taking charge.
15,16,YOUNG SAM,"Well, then I'm coming."
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,No. S-Stay here. Be normal.
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Then I'm coming.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Yeah. Again, no. This ain't the friggin' Goonies. None of you has been on a hunt before. Just... stay. I got this."
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Hey! [she surprised Dean and he turns on her with his gun already drawn] Whoa.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,What the hell are you doing here? I told you to s...
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,"Yeah, well, my mom says I never listen, so... Look, I get it... you're a very experienced monster hunter. But I'm not leaving. Come on. Don't you want a partner? [she watches Dean pick the lock] Not very good at that, are you? [just as Dean gets it open]"
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,Just stay behind me.
15,16,YOUNG SAM,"Don't worry. They'll... They'll be back soon. Whatever it is, my brother will kill it. Come on. L-Let's Boggle."
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,"This place is, um... really gross."
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"You asked for it. I mean, hunting usually means going to gross places."
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Are you... Are you sweating?
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,Huh?
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,"Um, you seem tense. Scared, even."
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,What? No. [Dean sees something in the darkness and goes to investigate] Stay here.
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,"Dean? Dean, what is it? What did you see?"
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,Nothing. She's not here. Come on.
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Dean!
15,16,YOUNG TRAVIS,What's happening?
15,16,YOUNG SAM,Travis!
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Travis!
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Sam, get back!"
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,"Travis, Travis!"
15,16,DEAN,Sam?
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Hey, Dean. I've been waiting for you. You know what you have to do."
15,16,DEAN,You... You're...
15,16,YOUNG DEAN/MONSTER,You failed. Say hi to Travis.
15,16,SAM,Dean? Dean? What are you doing?
15,16,DEAN,She's right. Caitlin's right.
15,16,DEAN,"Caitlin, I'm sorry. I just... I didn't want to believe you."
15,16,CAITLIN,I didn't have any proof. It was just... a feeling.
15,16,SAM,"Dean thought he killed it. I mean, we all thought he killed it."
15,16,DEAN,"Yeah, well, I didn't, and now Travis is..."
15,16,SAM,"Yeah. Right. Okay. Well... second chance. So, if we want to stop her for good this time, we need to figure out first what she is. What do we know?"
15,16,CAITLIN,"She's scary. I-I mean, she plays with people. Back then, she could've just grabbed Travis, but he said she drew it out. Lured him, made a sick, freaky game of it."
15,16,DEAN,"She can look like other people, other things. Just now, she looked like me when I was a kid."
15,16,SAM,All right. I'll hit the lore. You okay?
15,16,CAITLIN,Lore?
15,16,SAM,"Yeah. Uh, uh, books. About monsters."
15,16,DEAN,"Uh, there's one more thing. Um... She keeps some kind of a nest."
15,16,SAM,A nest?
15,16,DEAN,"Yeah. When I was a kid, I saw it. A bunch of bodies. Dead kids."
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,What is it? What did you see?
15,16,CAITLIN,That's... what you were hiding from me.
15,16,DEAN,They were all about the same age we were back then. I guess she keeps them there and... feeds.
15,16,SAM,"Dean, why didn't you ever tell me this?"
15,16,DEAN,"Because I'd never seen anything like that before. So after I killed it... or thought that I killed it... I phoned in the... the bodies, let the authorities take care of it, and shoved it down the old memory hole. I had nightmares about that for the longest time. I'm sorry. I should've told you."
15,16,SAM,"No, man, it's okay. I mean, you were just a kid. You know, we were both just kids. And, hell, we used to keep a lot of secrets from each other."
15,16,DEAN,"Mm. Okay. Well, you guys hit the books. I'm gonna go get us some grub."
15,16,SAM,Yeah.
15,16,DEAN,"Yeah, let me do, uh, two burger meals, uh, one veggie-burger meal, and... 'cause I know my brother's gonna ask...  do you have arugula salad or kale?"
15,16,SANDY,"We've got iceberg lettuce, with ranch."
15,16,DEAN,"Good for you. Yeah. I'll do all that to-go, please."
15,16,BILLIE,"Hello, Dean."
15,16,DEAN,What the hell are you doing here?
15,16,BILLIE,I could ask you the same thing. Working a case? Now? I just came from one of Chuck's worlds. Watched a whole planet burn alive... reduced to a cinder.
15,16,DEAN,"Yeah, well, not to make light of the, uh, Death Star-level galactic genocide, but what else is new?"
15,16,BILLIE,"That was the last one. The last world but this world. He'll be back. Soon. Could be today, could be tomorrow, but when he comes, there won't be a moment to waste. You've got Amara on the hook. I visited Jack in your bunker, gave him his final orders. The last step of his transformation."
15,16,DEAN,Yeah. Filling him up with your cosmic TNT so he can die. How'd you talk the kid into that one?
15,16,BILLIE,"I told him the truth. Jack killed your mother, and all he wants is your forgiveness. And I surmise that the only way he can get that is ending God and freeing you from the... What did you call it? Hamster wheel. Was I wrong?"
15,16,CAITLIN,So... this is your life now?
15,16,SAM,Pretty much.
15,16,CAITLIN,I'm sorry. Don't you ever want to be... I don't know... normal?
15,16,SAM,"Well, we help people, you know? Save them. I'm just sorry we couldn't... save Travis."
15,16,BILLIE,This is the last time you'll see me again. Until the end.
15,16,DEAN,What are you talking about? You just said that everything's about to go down.
15,16,BILLIE,"Exactly. And according to Chuck's book, I'm not in this part of the story."
15,16,DEAN,"Oh, well, that's friggin' great."
15,16,BILLIE,"So... this is on you, Dean."
15,16,DEAN,"Yeah, well... one Messenger of God's Destruction right here."
15,16,BILLIE,And you need to tell me now. Do we have a problem?
15,16,DEAN,"No. No, I want Chuck dead. I need him dead. I don't have to like every part of the plan."
15,16,BILLIE,And your brother?
15,16,DEAN,He'll get there.
15,16,BILLIE,"He doesn't know. I don't care why you've been hiding this from your brother. But I don't like loose ends, Dean. I don't like disorder. So clean this up. I need to know that you've got your house in order."
15,16,SAM,Hmm. Think I got something. Check this out.
15,16,CAITLIN,What?
15,16,SAM,"Look at this. Uh, Baba Yaga. A witch who feeds on children's fear using hallucinations. So, according to this, she wears this ring. It's technically her heart, and it's the source of her power."
15,16,SAM,What?
15,16,CAITLIN,"My mom gave it to him. That winter, she pulled it out of a vacuum. It's unclaimed property. The stone inside used to be all busted up, but he thought it looked cool. Put it on a silver chain, wore it on his neck. It was his lucky charm. He got it fixed a few weeks before..."
15,16,SAM,"So what if stabbing her isn't what stopped her? I mean, Dean cut her fingers off. You know, the ring got separated, lost. So what if... Wait. The stone. You said it used to be brok... en? Caitlin? Caitlin?!"
15,16,TRAVIS/BABA YAGA,"Hey, sis. Are you looking... for this?"
15,16,CAITLIN,No! No! Aah!
15,16,SAM,Hey. Where have you been?!
15,16,DEAN,Wow. Somebody's hungry. Where's Caitlin?
15,16,SAM,Gone! I've been looking for her. I-I-I found her car in the parking lot. I've been calling her. She hasn't been answering her phone. I think the Baba Yaga grabbed her.
15,16,DEAN,The Baba Yaga?
15,16,SAM,"Yes, the Baba Yaga. We ID'd the monster. An ancient witch, immortal. Kind of. I don't think we ever really killed her. We just damaged the source of her power... um, this ring."
15,16,DEAN,"Okay. So, we track her down, junk her Precious, and game over?"
15,16,SAM,"I think so, yeah."
15,16,DEAN,All right.  What are we looking for?
15,16,SAM,"Her nest. Last time, kids were taken all over town, near the cannery. This time, all the attacks have happened here."
15,16,DEAN,All right. It's gotta be close. Let's split up and check it out.
15,16,CLERK,Dude! What the hell?
15,16,SAM,Sorry.
15,16,DEAN,I've seen this movie before.
15,16,DEAN,Sam.
15,16,DEAN,I know what you are now.
15,16,BABA YAGA,That won't work.
15,16,DEAN,"Aren't I a little old for you, huh? I thought you liked kids."
15,16,BABA YAGA,I do. But all those hungry years... I'm starving.
15,16,SAM,Dean!
15,16,CAITLIN,Thank you. What you did for me. What you did for Travis. Hey. That thing. Were you scared?
15,16,DEAN,Always am.
15,16,CAITLIN,You have changed. The old you never would have admitted that.
15,16,DEAN,"Well, I'm not sure that's a good thing."
15,16,CAITLIN,"I think so. What do they say about getting older? You tell the truth more because you know that lies... they don't make anything better. Take care, Dean."
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,Thank you. I'm glad you were here.
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"If anything ever happens that's... you know... call this number, okay?"
15,16,YOUNG CAITLIN,"I hope I never have to. Bye, Dean. Bye, Sam."
15,16,YOUNG SAM,Bye. Those... other kids. Did you ever find them when you were looking for the monster?
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,Nah. They're probably gone.
15,16,YOUNG SAM,What are we gonna tell Dad?
15,16,YOUNG DEAN,"That I handled it. With a little help. Sam, uh, about the college thing... I don't know. But... we do make a good team. Right?"
15,16,YOUNG SAM,Yeah. We do.
15,16,DEAN,Who you calling?
15,16,SAM,I'm just trying Cas again.
15,16,DEAN,Hang it up.
15,16,SAM,What?
15,16,DEAN,Hang up the phone.
15,16,SAM,What's going on?
15,16,DEAN,I got an update. While you and Caitlin were researching... Billie paid me a visit.
15,16,SAM,What?
15,16,DEAN,"It's go time. Chuck's done with all the other worlds, and he'll be here any day, and when he does, we gotta act fast. And there's something else."
15,16,SAM,Something else?
15,16,DEAN,"Jack's gonna die. Apparently, it was always part of Billie's plan. Jack's known this whole time. And he's ready to sacrifice himself. So in order to kill God and Amara, Jack has to die."
15,16,SAM,Wait. So... Billie just told you this while you were grabbing burgers?
15,16,DEAN,"No. Cas did, before we left. Before we even got the call about Travis."
15,16,SAM,"So you've been sitting on this. What the hell, Dean? I thought we were past stuff like this."
15,16,DEAN,I know. Sam...
15,16,SAM,"I can't believe you! You know that? I mean, how can you keep me in the dark about something so huge?!"
15,16,DEAN,"'Cause I know you couldn't handle it! You didn't trust Billie's plan, and then, when we found out about Amara, you... you...  you started second-guessing. You raise these... these ""ethical questions."""
15,16,SAM,"I shouldn't? Jack's gonna kill himself, and I should just shut up about it?"
15,16,DEAN,Yes!
15,16,SAM,No!
15,16,DEAN,"This is how we end Chuck, okay?! This is the only way we'll ever be free! So I'm sorry, Sam! You don't get a choice!  We don't get a choice!"
15,16,SAM,"Oh, ""we."""
15,16,DEAN,"Look, man..."
15,16,SAM,Stop! All right?! Just stop! Please!
15,16,DEAN,I'm sorry I didn't t...
15,16,SAM,Don't. Don't. Don't. Just... Just drive. Just drive.
15,17,DEAN,Jack is supposed to kill God. That still leaves...
15,17,SAM,Amara.
15,17,DEAN,"I'm thinking Jack kills her. Then there's no God, there's no Darkness. World saved."
15,17,CHUCK,It's time to clear the board. It's time to start unwinding whole worlds.
15,17,DEAN,"We want to take your brother down... we need your help... our pal Jack, he'll be strong enough to trap Chuck."
15,17,AMARA,I'll think about it.
15,17,CAS,We're on the same side. Against Chuck.
15,17,ENTITY,"I'm on Death's side. When her plan works, I finally get to go back to sleep."
15,17,BILLIE,"Hello, Dean. I gave Jack the last step of his transformation. Do we have a problem?"
15,17,CAS,"There's something you and Sam, you need to know."
15,17,DEAN,"Chuck's done with all the other worlds, and he'll be here any day, and when he does, Jack's gonna die."
15,17,SAM,How can you keep me in the dark about something so huge?!
15,17,DEAN,'Cause I know you couldn't handle it!
15,17,SAM,No!
15,17,DEAN,This is how we end Chuck!
15,17,SAM,Just stop!
15,17,AMARA,"Welcome home, brother."
15,17,[INTERIOR,"Bunker library. Sam is on the phone with Cas, his laptop and dozens of books spread on the table.]"
15,17,SAM,Nothing? You sure?
15,17,[EXTERIOR,"day, Cas is by his truck in a rural farm area]"
15,17,CAS,"Yes. I'd sequestered myself in the archives of the Basilica of Guadeloupe, chasing down a rumor of a spell so powerful it could, quote, wound God Himself. But it turns out it was just that-- a rumor. I just... I don't know what else to do."
15,17,SAM,That's alright. We'll find a way. Just get home.
15,17,DEAN,That Cas? [Sam doesn't even acknowledge Dean's presence] So that's how it's gonna be? You give me the silent treatment?
15,17,SAM,I'm not sure what you want me to say.
15,17,DEAN,"That you get it. Like, I said, killing Amara, Jack dying... that's the only way."
15,17,SAM,"""The only way."" ""Our one shot,"" ""our last chance."" You ever get tired of saying stuff like that?"
15,17,DEAN,"We don't have to like it, alright, but you and me, we gotta get it done."
15,17,AMARA,"Sam, Dean. We should talk."
15,17,AMARA,My brother has returned. That means it's time.
15,17,SAM,Did he contact you?
15,17,AMARA,"He's made himself known. How do you intend to cage him? When God caged me, he had four archangels. Do you have four archangels?"
15,17,DEAN,Nope. We got one Jack.
15,17,AMARA,"I wish we'd gotten to know one another. That's my fault. Maybe when all of this is over, we can?"
15,17,DEAN,"He's been juicing himself up, getting stronger."
15,17,JACK,But I need to complete a final ritual.
15,17,AMARA,What do you need me to do?
15,17,[INTERIOR,the war room. Cut to Dean walking Amara out after their conversation.]
15,17,DEAN,"Just want to let you know, you are saving our asses here. You're saving the whole world's ass."
15,17,AMARA,I haven't saved anything yet.
15,17,DEAN,"But when the time comes, we can count on you, right?"
15,17,AMARA,"Like I told you when we first met, you and I will always help each other."
15,17,JACK,You're angry with me.
15,17,SAM,"No, I'm not angry. I..."
15,17,JACK,You're disappointed?
15,17,SAM,"Jack, look... I wish you'd have been up front with us. But sacrificing your life for a cause... takes a lot of courage. I still think it's wrong, though."
15,17,DEAN,"Alright, we're all set. Jack, why don't you go get your stuff. I'm thinking we leave now, we'll make Santa Fe by tomorrow morning."
15,17,SAM,"Yeah, um, I'm not coming."
15,17,DEAN,What?
15,17,SAM,You and Jack got this covered.
15,17,DEAN,Chuck is back. You wanna take a knee?
15,17,SAM,That's not what I'm doing.
15,17,DEAN,Wh... You don't even have any leads.
15,17,SAM,"What do you have, Dean? Honestly?! What, Billie's sending you to Santa Fe to... to meet up with her mystery guest that's gonna perform the ""final ritual,"" or whatever that is, and turn Jack into a suicide bomb?"
15,17,DEAN,"Sam, you and me, we have to do this, it's in the book!"
15,17,SAM,"Oh, Chuck's ""Death Book,"" right? Come on, man! Blindly following orders?! Lying to Amara, sending her to her death? Does any of this feel right to you?!"
15,17,DEAN,It doesn't matter how we feel! You know what? Stay. Stay. But somebody's gotta be the grownup here.
15,17,SAM,"Yeah, well, someone has to keep fighting for Jack."
15,17,DEAN,He knows what he signed up for!
15,17,SAM,"Last I checked, we don't give up on family."
15,17,DEAN,"Jack's not family. I know how you feel about the kid, okay. I care for him, too. I do. But he's not like you. He's not like Cas. He's just not."
15,17,JACK,I'm... I'm ready.
15,17,DEAN,"Well, then, let's hit the road."
15,17,CAS,"Sam. Stayed behind to find another way, huh? I would've done the same."
15,17,CHUCK,"Hey, sis."
15,17,CHUCK,"Hey, sis."
15,17,CHUCK,"You check out my light show the other night? It's pretty rad, huh?"
15,17,AMARA,You've been ending worlds. And now you've come for this one?
15,17,CHUCK,Saved the best for last.
15,17,AMARA,And then what?
15,17,CHUCK,"You know, I've been asking myself that question a lot lately... what happens after the end? And I have an idea... but I need your help."
15,17,AMARA,No. Absolutely not.
15,17,CHUCK,"Come on! You know the rules. I can create, I can destroy, but I can't do a hard reset-- reboot everything-- without you."
15,17,AMARA,Not happening.
15,17,CHUCK,"The Winchesters have gotten to you, huh? Figures-- you and Dean have that whole weird... thing."
15,17,AMARA,That wasn't you? Writing?
15,17,CHUCK,Ugh! Not that part. Gross.
15,17,AMARA,"Well, I'm not on Dean's side. And I'm not on yours. Someone needs to defend this world."
15,17,CHUCK,"Oh, please! You don't care about any of this."
15,17,AMARA,I do-- and so should you. Walk with me.
15,17,CHUCK,"Okay, I'm walking. We're walking."
15,17,AMARA,"You never slow down, do you? Take a breath-- revel in this wonderful thing you created."
15,17,CHUCK,"Right-- and this is where you drop some sappy crap about how ""perfect"" my first tree was or whatever."
15,17,AMARA,"Wasn't it, though? Perfect?"
15,17,CHUCK,"Yeah, it was pretty sweet. It was a fern. I was obsessed with fractals."
15,17,AMARA,Now you want to annihilate it? All of it.
15,17,CHUCK,No. You don't understand.
15,17,AMARA,"Oh, I think I do. You want to evaporate every kernel of existence because the Winchesters won't do what you say."
15,17,CHUCK,"It's not about that. It's about everywhere I look, I'm reminded of my failures. Like, why did I go with carbon-based life? Why not silicon? Or yttrium? Zeroing out-- starting fresh. That's what I need."
15,17,AMARA,"None of this was a failure-- not a tree, not a human--"
15,17,CHUCK,"Humans! [scoffs]  Humans are the worst. Lame, disappointing. They ruin everything they touch. And they're just so boring! I'm over them."
15,17,AMARA,What about your first children?
15,17,CHUCK,"Heaven? Really? Look, I appreciate the effort, but none of this really lights my wick anymore. So, uh..."
15,17,AMARA,"Remind me, how does your wick feel about fans?"
15,17,VARIOUS ANGELS,"Oh, is that really...?!  It is! It's him.  This is amazing! He's so handsome.  He's everything."
15,17,TALLI,"Oh, my God! I mean... Oh, my you! Could... Could you sign this for me?"
15,17,CHUCK,Sure.
15,17,TALLI,You are the way and the truth and the light.
15,17,CHUCK,Cool.
15,17,TALLI,"Make it out to Talli. Actually, um, Crystal. Talli's a nickname. Actually, could you make it..."
15,17,CHUCK,"Okay! Don't worry... they're not gone, they're just... away. Oof, I guess ""Don't meet your idols"" goes both ways, am I right? So, meeting those mouth-breathers was supposed to inspire me to do what?"
15,17,AMARA,I wanted you to feel their love... Their perfect angelic devotion.
15,17,CHUCK,Ah. Yeah.
15,17,AMARA,Really?
15,17,CHUCK,"I've made up my mind. We can go round and round, but you know me. In the end, I always get what I want."
15,17,AMARA,What about what I want.
15,17,CHUCK,Okay... what do you want?
15,17,AMARA,"Balance-- something we've never tried before-- creation and destruction, light and dark, brother and sister united again, but on behalf of one world-- this world. True balance. The way it was always meant to be."
15,17,CHUCK,Hmm. [Chuck shrugs]
15,17,AMARA,"But you can't. You only care about your pleasure. Your story. Well, I guess that makes you the villain."
15,17,CHUCK,Villains get all the best lines.
15,17,CHUCK,"Oh! The Winchesters' bunker. Are they behind that door? Is this a parent trap sort of thing? 'Cause no. No way. Hasta la vis... [Chuck snaps his fingers and nothing happens, so he tries again] Hasta la... Okay, well, why is that not working? Is this a trap?"
15,17,AMARA,"I gave you an out, but you just wouldn't take it."
15,17,CHUCK,You B-word!
15,17,AMARA,"The Winchesters have found a way to bind you, Brother."
15,17,CHUCK,What? No. No! You can't hold me here forever.
15,17,AMARA,I can hold you long enough.
15,17,DEAN,"Listen, Jack, I don't know what you heard back there, but..."
15,17,JACK,You don't have to say anything. And... you don't need to be sorry. I'm not like Sam or Cas. I... I understand.
15,17,DEAN,You sure this is the spot?
15,17,JACK,Billie said... this is where it ends.
15,17,ADAM,Jack?
15,17,JACK,Hello?
15,17,ADAM,Hmm.
15,17,DEAN,"So... you must be Billie's mystery guy, Jim?"
15,17,ADAM,"Oh, no, no, no! Jim's a buddy. He just lets me use his shop. I'm Adam."
15,17,DEAN,Oh. A-Adam.
15,17,ADAM,"Yeah, you know... God's primo. First dude off the assembly line."
15,17,DEAN,"Wait... The... The garden, the apple... that Adam?"
15,17,ADAM,"It was a quince, but yeah."
15,17,DEAN,Wow. So then that makes you Eve?
15,17,SERAFINA,"Serafina. [She looks at Jack, but speaks to Adam] Babe."
15,17,ADAM,Yeah.
15,17,SERAFINA,His aura.
15,17,ADAM,I know.
15,17,SERAFINA,It's like Skittles.
15,17,ADAM,"Yeah, she's my old lady. She's the only one who could put up with me all these years, huh?"
15,17,SERAFINA,"Awwww, babe."
15,17,DEAN,What's happening?
15,17,ADAM,"Alright, let's get this party started. You're with me, Jack."
15,17,DEAN,"Hey, w-w-wait, wait. Where you taking him?"
15,17,ADAM,"Oh, just a little private pop quiz. Can't hand out the ""spark of the divine"" to just anyone."
15,17,JACK,"Dean, I'm okay."
15,17,JACK,"So, you're really the first human?"
15,17,ADAM,"God's ""first story,"" yeah. Jumped through every hoop, talked to every snake. When he kicked us out of paradise, Eve and me, we figured, eh, we deserved it. Then he moved on... to our sons."
15,17,SERAFINA,"Relax, babe! He's gonna pass."
15,17,DEAN,And you know that how?
15,17,SERAFINA,Saw it in my dreams. We were sipping mushroom tea in the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
15,17,DEAN,So you were tripping balls and you saw Jack?
15,17,SERAFINA,Uh-huh.
15,17,DEAN,Awesome.
15,17,JACK,You hate him.
15,17,ADAM,"Oh, no. I've been wanting this for going on 300,000 years. Took me that long to figure out how to do it, too."
15,17,JACK,Wait— killing God is your plan?
15,17,ADAM,"Yeah, Billie's been giving us a hand, yeah. Sera and me, this is our baby, yeah. She kept me alive this long so I could see it through. All we've been waiting on is you."
15,17,JACK,Me?
15,17,ADAM,"Yeah. The main ingredient. Half-human, half-archangel, all-powerful. At least, you could be, if you pass the test. [Adam opens a display case with an assortment of crystals inside] So, here it goes. One of these pretty little suckers has been touched by God himself. It holds the spark of the divine. All you gotta do is tell me which one."
15,17,SERAFINA,"I mean, just think of, like, everything that had to happen for you to get Jack to this place, to this moment. Baby, it was meant to be."
15,17,ADAM,That's your choice?
15,17,JACK,"Yes. [Adam looks slightly disappointed, but Jack goes on] And the others.  All of them. They're just rocks but their existence makes them divine. Because God is in everything."
15,17,ADAM,"[he sighs with relief and smiles at Jack] Right on. At least, he should be."
15,17,JACK,I did it.
15,17,SERAFINA,Far out! [she gives Jack a high five]
15,17,DEAN,"Okay, uh, great... well, now what?"
15,17,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell are you doing?!"
15,17,ADAM,"Dudes, chill. [to Serafina] Do it."
15,17,DEAN,What the hell is that?
15,17,ADAM,"It's one of my ribs, dude. Everything can contain the spark of the divine, but this puppy? It's packing enough punch to create life. Or, in your case, destroy God."
15,17,SERAFINA,"Jack, making your vessel strong, reclaiming your human soul, it was... it was all preparing you for this."
15,17,JACK,What'll it do to me?
15,17,ADAM,Start an elemental chain reaction. It fuses your soul and your grace into a... Like a...
15,17,SERAFINA,Metaphysical supernova.
15,17,DEAN,Meaning what?
15,17,ADAM,"You'll collapse into a living black hole for divine energy. One nothing can escape— not the darkness, not God himself. But once it starts... you can't stop it."
15,17,ADAM,"So, don't use 'til game time. You dig?"
15,17,JACK,I dig.
15,17,ADAM,He digs.
15,17,JACK,We're almost home.
15,17,DEAN,"Yeah, I need to say something before we head in."
15,17,JACK,"No, I-i-it's okay."
15,17,DEAN,"Hold up. Just... What I said to Sam, you didn't need to hear that. Alright? Not now. Not with the weight that you're carrying— for us, for this world. Jack... I don't know how to explain it, but what I found out about Chuck... it's like—it's like I wasn't alive. Not really. You know, like, my whole life I've never been free. But like, really free. But now... now me and Sam, we got a shot at living a life. Without all this crap on our backs. And that's— that's because of you. So, I— I— I wanted to say... I need to say... Thank you, Jack. Thank you."
15,17,JACK,You're welcome.
15,17,DEAN,Yeah. Okay.
15,17,JACK,"It's time, isn't it?"
15,17,DEAN,It's time.
15,17,SAM,Sorry.
15,17,CAS,"It's alright. I understand it. I-I... I feel it, too. It's hopelessness."
15,17,SAM,Maybe Dean was right.
15,17,CAS,"Yeah, maybe."
15,17,SAM,"It just... It feels wrong. You know, Billie's got Dean so convinced."
15,17,CAS,But you don't believe her?
15,17,SAM,"I don't know what I believe. I just wish I could talk to her, Billie, before it all goes down, you know, just to make sure."
15,17,CAS,"There is no easy way to summon death, and I will not let you end your own life."
15,17,SAM,"Cas, that's not what I'm saying. Wait... You remember when Sergei was here? Remember what he was looking for?"
15,17,CAS,"Yeah, it was the Key to Death."
15,17,SAM,Yes.
15,17,CAS,"Wait, he said it would open the doorway to— to Death's Library."
15,17,SAM,"If it's in the bunker and if we can find it, m-maybe I can just... walk up to her, right?"
15,17,CAS,Right.
15,17,CAS,Sam?
15,17,SAM,"Cas, this has to be it."
15,17,SAM,"It's in Latin. Viator mortalis, cave, quoniam scias Clavem Mortis pensare graviter. Il tamen desideres, ut introeas illum abyssum obscurissium artis, opus est tibi porta."
15,17,CAS,"Sam, I should go with you."
15,17,SAM,"No, Cas... Look, I don't know if this is crazy or... or what, but if Dean beats me back here... Buy me some time?"
15,17,CAS,"Sam, for what it's worth, I don't think you're crazy. I think your internal compass is functioning perfectly."
15,17,REAPER,"Please! Wait, wait, don't hurt me! No!"
15,17,ANOTHER REAPER,"Please, please. She won't come!"
15,17,THE ENTITY,Keep praying or whatever.
15,17,REAPER,"It's hopeless! Please! O-Okay, okay, okay. [he prays, and nothing happens] I told you."
15,17,THE ENTITY,Sam Winchester?
15,17,SAM,Meg?
15,17,THE ENTITY,"Sorry, she's still dead. Just borrowing the Queen's pretty face 'cause really, I'm Empty."
15,17,SAM,You're the Empty?
15,17,THE ENTITY,That's what I said.
15,17,SAM,What are you doing here?
15,17,THE ENTITY,"Death and me need a word. Been trying her party-line, but she's ignoring me. I hate that."
15,17,SAM,What do you want?
15,17,THE ENTITY,"The Empty was supposed to be mine. Not even God held sway. But lies, sweet little lies. Billie said when she takes over, she'd make it all better, but then your busted-ass friend in the trench coat came along and he gave me these trust issues."
15,17,SAM,Billie wants to take over?
15,17,THE ENTITY,"Become ""New God."" Classic narcissist, right? She's all tingly for the rules, the good-old days."
15,17,SAM,What is that supposed to mean?
15,17,THE ENTITY,"Everyone back to where they belong... realities, dimensions, graves. What should be dead
dies, angels off Earth, demons back to Hell, and I go back to sleep. Or I'm supposed to. Except, again, trust issues. But you, you're Sam Winchester. You're in God's book. [she taps the thick book on Billie's desk]"
15,17,SAM,That's... That's Chuck's Death Book? Have you read it?
15,17,THE ENTITY,"Only Billie can read it, dummy. She always talked about how you should be so dead, except she needs you. So, maybe if I hurt you... [she holds up a hand and makes a fist. Sam crumples in pain and groans] Hear that? Get your scythe down here, Billie, or your boy's toast."
15,17,SAM,Wait! Stop! Billie sent me.
15,17,SAM,Billie... She sent me.
15,17,THE ENTITY,"Really? 'Cause you're saying a lot of dumb stuff for, you know, an Emissary of Death."
15,17,SAM,Yeah. We're all... We're trying to beat God. Not a whole lot of time for questions.
15,17,THE ENTITY,Go on.
15,17,SAM,Billie... sent me... to get the book. She didn't say why.
15,17,THE ENTITY,Where is she?
15,17,SAM,"Earth. You can't go there, can you?"
15,17,THE ENTITY,Only if I'm summoned. God's so protective of his little sand castles.
15,17,SAM,"Well, Billie can't leave, either, something about the plan, so she sent me with a message. Billie will honor her promise. God, Amara-- they die. And you, you can go back to sleep."
15,17,THE ENTITY,And if you're lying?
15,17,SAM,"I guess you have two choices. Give me the book— maybe we all win. But you kill me, we lose... And you will never go back to sleep."
15,17,SAM,Cas.
15,17,CAS,"Sam, finally."
15,17,SAM,What?
15,17,CAS,It's Amara. She's here with Chuck. It's time.
15,17,SAM,"No, no, no. Cas, we can't let that happen. We have to stop it."
15,17,AMARA,"It's not too late, brother. You can still choose this world, us. It doesn't have to end like this. I--"
15,17,CHUCK,Amara. Shut up.
15,17,SAM,Chuck and Amara cannot die.
15,17,CAS,"Wait, I don't understand."
15,17,DEAN,Are they ready? We need to get this kid in the room right now.
15,17,SAM,"Wait, wait... Dean... Dean, no. Listen!"
15,17,CHUCK,You hear that?
15,17,AMARA,What?
15,17,CHUCK,"Dean. Brought to the edge of doubt. His sense of duty, his rage winning out in the end."
15,17,SAM,Billie is playing us.
15,17,DEAN,"So, what, her plan's not gonna work?"
15,17,SAM,"No, it will work."
15,17,DEAN,Then great.
15,17,SAM,"But listen, if Jack takes out God and Amara, it'll create a power vacuum that Billie will fill. This was all her power grab."
15,17,CAS,"Wait, Death wants to become God?"
15,17,DEAN,"As long as Chuck dies, I'm good."
15,17,SAM,"Okay, listen, just stop. [He circles around in front of Dean, blocking the way]"
15,17,DEAN,"Get outta the way, Sam. What are you doing?!"
15,17,SAM,I'm trying to make you listen.
15,17,CHUCK,And poor Sam. Always gotta know everything. Can't leave well enough alone.
15,17,DEAN,We don't have time! Jack already lit the fuse! We gotta go!
15,17,CAS,You did what?
15,17,DEAN,"Sam, I'm not gonna ask you again."
15,17,SAM,"Dean, please."
15,17,CHUCK,This is my ending. My real ending.
15,17,CAS,"Dean, don't."
15,17,DEAN,"Move, Sam. Move!"
15,17,AMARA,You orchestrated this?
15,17,CHUCK,"What part of omniscient do you people not understand? So I can't read my ""Death Book."" So what? I control space and time. Just plant a few visions, goad Death a little... Mess with a few outcomes... And... bada-bing! I mean... [laughing]They think they can kill me?"
15,17,SAM,"Dean, don't do this."
15,17,DEAN,"I don't want to do this, but this is everything!"
15,17,SAM,"No, it's not!"
15,17,AMARA,They're not going to kill you. They're going to cage you.
15,17,CHUCK,"Oh, sis..."
15,17,CHUCK,They want to kill me. And... they want to kill you. There's no cage. There never was.
15,17,DEAN,"Let's go, let's go."
15,17,SAM,"Dean. No, Dean."
15,17,SAM,Wait. Stop! You gotta listen.
15,17,CHUCK,"Sam and Dean, they're using Jack to destroy us."
15,17,AMARA,"No, but... but Dean can't hurt me."
15,17,CHUCK,"No, but he can lie to you. He could send you into the meat grinder with a wink and a smile."
15,17,SAM,"Jack, don't!"
15,17,CAS,"Sam, why not?"
15,17,SAM,"Because if Billie takes over, then everyone goes back to where they belong. That means everybody from apocalypse world, Bobby, Charlie, they get sent back to a place that doesn't exist anymore. And everyone we saved. Eileen, she... she just dies again. And that's just the beginning."
15,17,CHUCK,"Look, I get it. You wanted him to care about you, but humans... they'll break your heart every time."
15,17,DEAN,"Sam, we don't have a choice. Jack's about to blow!"
15,17,SAM,We always have a choice.
15,17,CHUCK,"I spent so long searching for happiness, contentedness. In creation... or the Winchesters. But the only ones who will ever really ""get"" us... is us. You and me. Back together?"
15,17,DEAN,"There's nothing else we can do, okay?! We just gotta get out of the way."
15,17,SAM,"No, we can't get out of the way, Dean, not this time."
15,17,DEAN,"I don't care if Billie gets what she wants! I don't, man! I'd trade it all— I'd trade 'em all for Chuck in a heartbeat!"
15,17,SAM,What about me? Would you trade me?
15,17,AMARA,Balance.
15,17,CHUCK,"Yes. Think of it. Us starting fresh. Creating something new, something beautiful... peaceful... together. And we can finally forget about all this pain. No baggage. Only balance."
15,17,DEAN,"Chuck has to die. He has to! Otherwise he'll keep us tap dancing forever, and I can't live like that, man! I can't live like that! I won't!"
15,17,SAM,"I know you feel like that right now, okay. I know you do. But you gotta trust me. My entire life, you've protected me— from Dad, from Lucifer, from everything. I didn't always like it, you know, but... it's the one thing in the whole world that I could always count on. It's the only thing I've ever known that was true. So please... put the gun away. Just put it away, and we'll figure it out, Dean, we'll find another way, you and me. We always do."
15,17,CHUCK,"Are you kidding me?! After everything, all that, you... you did it again!"
15,17,CAS,Where's Amara?
15,17,CHUCK,Amara. Amara. She's in here somewhere.
15,17,CAS,"What, you consumed your sister?"
15,17,CHUCK,"We came to an understanding, so spare me your contempt, Castiel, the self-hating angel of Thursday. You know what every other version of you did after ""gripping him tight and raising him from perdition?"" They did what they were told. But not you. Not the ""one off the line with a crack in his chassis."" All of you. You know, I tried and I tried and I tried, but you're all just too stupid, too stubborn. Too broken. You know what? I'm over it. I'm over you."
15,17,SAM,Yeah? Good.
15,17,DEAN,"Screw you, Chuck."
15,17,CHUCK,"No, screw you. You know what you do with broken toys? You throw them out. So, kill each other, don't kill each other... I don't care."
15,17,CAS,What do you mean?
15,17,CHUCK,I mean... have fun watching him die.
15,17,CAS,Jack.
15,17,JACK,Help me!
15,17,DEAN,Hey.
15,17,DEAN,Jack!
15,18,SAM,Remember when Sergei was here? Remember what he was looking for?
15,18,COSMIC ENTITY,Sam Winchester?
15,18,CASTIEL,I'm the one you want. I'm the one who woke you up.
15,18,SAM,(to Jack) Sacrificing your life for a cause takes a lot of courage.
15,18,CHUCK,"Think of it, starting fresh. Creating something new, together."
15,18,DEAN,It's time.
15,19,Dean,No.
15,19,Sam,I couldn't save anybody. Billie...
15,19,Dean,It wasn't Billie. It was Chuck.
15,19,Sam,What?
15,19,Jack,Where's Cas?
15,19,Sam,Dean?
15,19,Dean,"He saved me. Billie was coming after us, and Cas summoned the Empty. It took her. And it took him.  Cas is gone."
15,19,Sam,This can't be happening.
15,19,Dean,"It is, Sam. I think everyone's gone."
15,19,Dean,"Jack, I'm sorry."
15,19,Sam,"Dean, do you think we're it?   All that's left?"
15,19,Dean,"Yeah. You, me, Jack."
15,19,Sam,"I did this. We could have just given Chuck what he wanted, you know, his grand finale. But I resisted. I pulled the thread. I thought we could beat this game, do it better. We tried to rewrite him, and the whole world paid the price."
15,19,Dean,"Sam, we can..."
15,19,Sam,"We can what? There's nothing left, Dean. No one left to save. Everybody's gone."
15,19,Jack,You can't just give up.
15,19,Sam,What other choice do we have?
15,19,Dean,He better.
15,19,Chuck,"Hey, guys. Enjoying a little alone time?"
15,19,Dean,"Alright, Chuck. You win."
15,19,Chuck,Well... sure. I always do. Me being me. Is that it or...
15,19,Sam,We'll give you what you want. That's right.
15,19,Dean,"The whole Cain-and-Abel thing. Us dead. Whatever. I'll kill Sam. Sam will kill me. We'll kill each other. Okay? You pick. But, first, you got to put everything back the way it was. The people, the birds, Cass. You got to bring him back."
15,19,Sam,We're surrendering. We're giving up.
15,19,Chuck,"Yeah, no. I mean, I appreciate the white flag, but, frankly, it's too little, too late. I'm kind of enjoying this story now."
15,19,Dean,You can't.
15,19,Chuck,"Oh, no, see, I'm the almighty. I really can. I mean, picture it. The two of you... And your little lapdog Jack... Rotting on a lifeless planet, knowing it's this way because you wouldn't take a knee. Eternal shame, suffering, and loneliness. Whew! That's deep. That's sophisticated. That's a page-turner."
15,19,Dean,I feel terrific.
15,19,Dean,"Yeah, me, too, pal. We need aspirin."
15,19,Jack,I'm sensing a presence. There's something out there... besides us.
15,19,Sam,Something like people? I don't know.
15,19,Dean,How are you sensing anything? I thought you were all powered down.
15,19,Jack,I'm not sure. But I feel it.
15,19,Sam,"Yeah, maybe that's the point. No one left to help. No one but us."
15,19,Jack,"In there or very nearby. Guys, I have no idea what we're walking into."
15,19,Sam,Michael.
15,19,Michael,"When the rapture first began, I took refuge here. It is St. Michael's, you may have noticed."
15,19,Dean,Are you hiding out from your dad?
15,19,Michael,I'm sure he's aware I took your side against him. I've avoided using any powers that might attract his attention.
15,19,Sam,And Adam?
15,19,Michael,"Gone. I'm sorry to say. Exterminated by my father, like everyone else."
15,19,Dean,Poor bastard never caught a break.
15,19,Michael,How did the three of you manage?
15,19,Dean,"Apparently, your old man has a sense of humor. He thought it would be hilarious to watch the three of us on an empty planet."
15,19,Michael,I never spent much time on Earth. I was... curious about the perception of God and Heaven.
15,19,Dean,And?
15,19,Michael,"Amazingly, the believers loved him. They have for thousands of years. I guess my efforts were more effective than I'd hoped."
15,19,Sam,Your efforts?
15,19,Michael,"When God left Heaven, I was certain of his return. So I made sure all of the angels and prophets burnished his image on Earth. The all-knowing, all-seeing, all-caring God."
15,19,Dean,Daddy's boy.
15,19,Jack,And now? After seeing what Chuck's done?
15,19,Dean,We reached out to you. You ignored us.
15,19,Michael,That was then. This is now. Tell me what you need me to do.
15,19,Michael,That's one of Death's books.
15,19,Dean,"Yeah, but this one is about God. And how to kill him."
15,19,Sam,"As far as we know, only Death can open it. But, um... we're hoping, uh... maybe you can, too."
15,19,Dean,"Screwed. I'm sure Chuck's ready to make a move. (Cellphone rings, vibrates. Caller ID says ""Cass"") What? (Beep) Cas?"
15,19,Castiel,Dean. I'm here. (Groans) I'm hurt. Can you let me in?
15,19,Sam,"No, you're not our ""pal."""
15,19,Lucifer,"Okay, be honest with me, please. Would you have let me in if I said it was really me?"
15,19,Dean,"You're dead. Uh... yeah, not so much."
15,19,Lucifer,"Um, after Pop nutted out and murdered pretty much everyone in the world, the Empty booted me with orders to find the missing God Book and use it on Chuck. Uh, normally, I'm not very good at following orders, as you guys know, but, uh, you do not want to mess with the Empty, man. Total ""B,"" especially after Jack blew up all over her, and she killed Death. (Chuckling) I mean, guys, never a dull moment. But that's the past. What's up?! We're a team again, guys."
15,19,Dean,"Oh, that is not happening."
15,19,Lucifer,"Mm. Yeah. Alright, team. I don't want to bring ants to your picnic, but that ain't gonna cut it. Okay, think about it. If the Empty pulled me off the bench, it's 'cause the Winchester charm ain't enough, right? And I did anticipate a little bit of pushback, so I did bring a token of good faith. Voilà."
15,19,Lucifer,"Oh, this is Betty. Betty... Betty, say hi. (Muffled) No, no, no. Say hi to the boys. (Chuckling) Just getting it straight. Oh, did I mention Betty is a reaper? I'm doing a fly-by, right? Okay. I'll say that again. Betty is a reaper."
15,19,Sam,"Yes, we heard you.  So what?"
15,19,Lucifer,Watch.
15,19,Lucifer,"Oh, no, this is... This is the first reaper to check out since Billie, right? So... wait for it. Wait for it. (Betty gets to her knees)  Ohhh... And... Meet the new Death."
15,19,Sam,You okay?
15,19,Dean,(Spits) Yeah.
15,19,Betty,"So, do you have it? The book. Hand over the book. Wow. Slower than they look."
15,19,Lucifer,Yeah.
15,19,Betty,"Okay, the end of God is in the special book, and if you give Betty the book, Betty can read it. Understand?"
15,19,Lucifer,Hmm. I cheated.
15,19,Dean,"Uh, I wouldn't exactly say ""trust."""
15,19,Lucifer,"Mikey, Mikey, come on, man. I get the bitterness. For all you did for the old man, you got no better from him than me. The son voted Most Likely to Suck, and that sucks."
15,19,Michael,"I did what I did because it was the right thing to do, not to get his love."
15,19,Lucifer,"Alright, well, that's a good thing, 'cause the man had no love to give... Not to you, not to me, not to... humanity. You see that now, right?"
15,19,Betty,(Clears throat) Asshats. I have opened the book. And? And it's in here... all that you want. I know how God ends.
15,19,Sam,Wait a second. You're sure about this?
15,19,Betty,Of course I'm sure. I'm Death.
15,19,Dean,You've been Death for an hour.
15,19,Betty,"""Behold, in the end, there is the ending of he who created the beginning."""
15,19,Lucifer,Fascinating.
15,19,Betty,"""And, thus, it will be..."""
15,19,Lucifer,D'oh!
15,19,Michael,You don't learn.  (He stabs Lucifer with an archangel blade)
15,19,Michael,Thanks for the blade.
15,19,Michael,"Yeah, a bit winded. I haven't been in a battle like that for several centuries."
15,19,Dean,"Yeah, well... glad you were here. Chuck's getting desperate. He knows something's up. Wouldn't take the chance of showing up himself."
15,19,Michael,Yes. He sent Lucifer. Brought him back from the dead. He didn't even reach out to me.
15,19,Dean,"Did you want him to? Of course not. I mean, he clearly he knows the God Book could be lethal to him. But it's actually fairly useless without Death to read it."
15,19,Dean,"Yeah, well... at least it's open. Sam thought that he recognized some of the symbols in the writing, thought they might be some form of Enochian. So he's gonna use the Book of the Damned, see if he can't figure out the end. And by that, I mean... the end."
15,19,Dean,I hope so. He's been in there a long time. (Sam enters) Oh. Why don't you ask him yourself.
15,19,Sam,Sorry. It's slow going. But I think I was able to piece it together.
15,19,Michael,"""It""?"
15,19,Sam,The spell. There's a spell. It has to be done at a particular place... at an exact angle from the sun. But it will release an unstoppable force that will find Chuck... and finish him.
15,19,Dean,Let's light it up.
15,19,Michael,Father.
15,19,Chuck,"Son. And, listen, I appreciate the heads-up about all this."
15,19,Michael,It's always been my destiny to serve you.
15,19,Chuck,"Yeah. The thing is, it's kind of late in the game. You did side with the Winchesters. I can't forgive that."
15,19,Michael,"Father, no. That was a lapse of judgment, I admit, but I swear I..."
15,19,Chuck,Save it!  (Chuck uses his power to destroy Michael.)
15,19,Sam,Alright. Well... one for the road. (Sam hits Chuck)
15,19,Chuck,"Cute. (Chuck uses his power to hurt Sam and Dean) Eh, what the heck. I can get my hands dirty. (Chuck starts beating Sam and Dean). Fellas, give it up now."
15,19,Chuck,"Come on, guys. Just stay down. (Chuck hits them again and again).  That's enough, guys. Guys, come on."
15,19,Sam,Because. You lose.  (Sam gestures towards Jack)
15,19,Chuck,"Hey, Jack."
15,19,Dean,We won.
15,19,Chuck,So this is how it ends. My book.
15,19,Sam,See for yourself.
15,19,Sam,"Oh, there is. But only Death can read it."
15,19,Dean,"That's right. So we had to come up with a plan ""B."" That wasn't too hard, though, when we realized that Michael really is a daddy's boy."
15,19,Dean,"See, he didn't take it too well when he found out that you asked Lucifer for help. Oh, he was desperate to be the favorite again."
15,19,Sam,"Since we couldn't read the book, we had to come up with a story about finding the spell, which we knew Michael would feed straight to you."
15,19,Dean,"All that prep work we did to turn Jack here into a cosmic bomb? Oh.  Well, it turned him into sort of a power vacuum. He's been sucking up bits of power all over the place."
15,19,Sam,"See, we knew Michael would warn you and you'd show up here. And you did. And you killed your own son."
15,19,Dean,And you beat the crap out of us. Releasing all kinds of power. God power. Jack absorbed it all. It made him...
15,19,Dean,"Well, it made him unstoppable."
15,19,Chuck,"This... This... This is why you're my favorites. You know, for the first time, I have no idea what happens next. Is this where you kill me? I mean, I could never think of an ending where I lose. But this, after everything that I've done to you... to die at the hands of Sam Winchester...  Of Dean Winchester, the ultimate killer... It's kind of glorious."
15,19,Dean,"Sorry, Chuck."
15,19,Chuck,What? What?
15,19,Dean,"See, that's not who I am. That's not who we are."
15,19,Chuck,What kind of an ending is this?
15,19,Sam,(to Jack) His power. You sure it won't come back?
15,19,Jack,It's not his power anymore.
15,19,Sam,(to Chuck) Then I think it's the ending where you're just like us and like all the other humans you forgot about.
15,19,Dean,"It's the ending where you grow old, you get sick, and you just die."
15,19,Sam,And no one cares. And no one remembers you. You're just forgotten.
15,19,Chuck,Guys... Guys... wait.
15,19,Chuck,"Guys... Guys! No, wait. G-Guys... Guys, wait! Guys, wait! Guys, wait! Wait, wait, wait! Please wait! Guys!"
15,19,Sam,"So... does this mean you're the new... I mean, what do we call you?"
15,19,Dean,"Who cares what we call him? Look, all that matters is he got us back online."
15,19,Sam,"Hey, what happened to Amara when Chuck..."
15,19,Jack,She's with me. We're in harmony.
15,19,Sam,You gonna come back with us to the bunker?
15,19,Dean,What do you mean? Of course he's gonna come back to the bunker. He's the man with the plan. He's top dog. He can do whatever he wants now. Come on. You know what? We'll spruce the place up. We'll get some recliners. We'll get you one of those big-screen TVs.
15,19,Jack,"Dean, I'm not coming back home. In a way... I'm already there."
15,19,Dean,Where?
15,19,Jack,Everywhere.
15,19,Sam,So you are Him.
15,19,Jack,I'm me. But I know what you mean.
15,19,Sam,"What if we want to see you? You know, or have a beer or whatever?"
15,19,Jack,"I'm around. I'll be in every drop of falling rain, every speck of dust that the wind blows, and in the sand, in the rocks, and the sea."
15,19,Dean,"It's a hell of a time to bail. You got a lot of people counting on you, people with questions. They're gonna need answers."
15,19,Jack,"And those answers will be in each of them. Maybe not today, but... someday.  People don't need to pray to me or to sacrifice to me. They just need to know that I'm already a part of them and to trust in that. I won't be hands on. Chuck put himself in the story. That was his mistake. But I learned from you and my mother and Castiel that... when people have to be their best... they can be. And that's what to believe in."
15,19,Dean,Mm-hmm. To everyone that we lost along the way.
15,19,Sam,"You know, with Chuck not writing our story anymore, we get to write our own. You know, just you and me going wherever the story takes us.  Just us."
15,19,Dean,"Finally, free."
15,19,MICHAEL,Sons and fathers are... complicated. Ask Dean.
15,20,DEAN,(pleased) Yeeeah.
2,1,NURSE,You'll need to undress.
2,1,DEAN,No. It would be wrong to go in. Would it?
2,1,BLOODY MAN,Please help me.
2,1,DEAN,You can see me?
2,1,BLOODY MAN,Don't let me die.
2,1,BLOODY MAN,Help me!
2,1,WOMAN,"I prefer Alex Trebek with the mustache, don't you?"
2,1,BLOODY MAN,I need a doctor. Don't let me die.
2,1,DEAN,Now what?
2,2,DAD,"Who the hell are you? 
Get out! Get out of my house!"
2,2,SAM,Hey!
2,2,DEAN,Hey.
2,2,DEAN,Do you mind...
2,3,Int. Motel ,Research victims. Dean is excited for the hunt.
2,3,TRT 1,12
2,3,SAM,"So someone's already here, killing vampires, huh?"
2,3,DEAN,"Well, whatever it is, it doesn't matter. You've still gotta smoke the nest, whether we find our mystery guest or not."
2,3,SAM,I suppose.
2,3,DEAN,Any luck with that address with Christine Flanagan?
2,3,SAM,"Nah, just a PO Box.  And guess what?"
2,3,DEAN,Hmm?
2,3,SAM,Same with the first victim.
2,3,DEAN,"(laughs.) Heh heh heh heh. Victim. that's, that's that's, funny."
2,3,SAM,"You know what, Dean, they both got hired six months ago."
2,3,DEAN,Yeah.
2,3,SAM,"Six months.  I mean, doesn't that seem long to you?  Weren't the last vampires we tangled with migratory?"
2,3,DEAN,"Well, if you think about it, I mean, they could get a job, they could blend in, you know.  nobody's gonna suspect the cute waitress at the diner, right?  So. They get enough people, they bleed 'em in the nest, it's an all-you-can-eat buffet."
2,3,SAM,"Yeah, okay.  But ... the missing persons stats around here are average. Hell, they're actually below average."
2,3,DEAN,"Well, maybe they're grabbing their takeout from someplace else.  I don't really care.  All I know is I get to kill some vampires."
2,3,DEAN,What?
2,3,SAM,"Look, don't get me wrong, all right?  I'm happy you're happy.  But don't you think that, with everything that happened to Dad, you're just acting a little too caffeinated?"
2,3,DEAN,"I'm enjoying my work, Sammy.  You oughta try it sometime."
2,4,LINDSEY,She was great.
2,4,DEAN,Hmm.
2,4,NEIL,"Well, she really loved that guy. But the night of the accident she walked in on him with another girl."
2,4,DEAN,Hmm.
2,4,DR. MASON,What?!
2,4,ANGELA screams,"Wait, don't --!!!!"
2,5,LATER,
2,6,KATIE,"I checked the fuses. They're fine. It's the wiring. Look, you promised the place would be ready when I moved in. No. You come up now! Please. Thank you."
2,6,KATIE,Gross.
2,6,KATIE,What the hell?
2,6,TITLE CARD:,SUPERNATURAL
2,6,DEAN,"Los Angeles, California."
2,6,SAM,What's in L.A.?
2,6,DEAN,Young girl's been kidnapped by an evil cult.
2,6,SAM,Yeah? Girl got a name?
2,6,DEAN,Katie Holmes.
2,6,DEAN,"Of course, on the other hand — catfight."
2,6,ELLEN,"I am your mother, I don't have to be reasonable!"
2,6,JO,You can't keep me here!
2,6,ELLEN,"Oh, don't you bet on that, sweetie."
2,6,JO,"What are you going to do, are you going to chain me up in the basement?"
2,6,ELLEN,"You know what, you've had worse ideas than that recently. Hey, you don't wanna stay, don't stay. Go back to school."
2,6,JO,I didn't belong there! I was a freak with a knife collection.
2,6,SAM,"Yes, ma'am."
2,6,DEAN,"Yeah, we rarely drink before ten anyway."
2,6,JO.,Wait. I wanna know what they think about this.
2,6,ELLEN,I don't care what they think!
2,6,DAD,Are you guys open?
2,6,ELLEN,Yes!
2,6,DAD,We'll just... check out the Arby's down the road.
2,6,ELLEN,"Harvelle's.  Yeah, Preacher."
2,6,DEAN,"No, but your mom might."
2,6,JO,"And this girl wasn't the first. Over the past eighty years six women have vanished. All from the same building, all young blondes. Only happens every decade or two so cops never eyeball the pattern. So we're either dealing with one very old serial killer, or —"
2,6,DEAN,Who put this together? Ash?
2,6,JO,I did it myself.
2,6,SAM,I gotta admit. We hit the road for a lot less.
2,6,ELLEN,"Good. You like the case so much, you take it."
2,6,JO,Mom!
2,6,ELLEN,"Joanna Beth, this family has lost enough. And I won't lose you too. I just won't."
2,6,SAM,"I feel kind of bad, snaking Jo's case."
2,6,SAM,"No, not yet."
2,6,SAM,What's that?
2,6,DEAN,What?
2,6,DEAN,"All right, let's find this badass before he snags any more girls."
2,6,JO,It's so convenient.
2,6,LANDLORD,"Yeah, it's a great building, fixed it up real nice. All the apartments come furnished, too."
2,6,JO,"It is so spacious. You know, my friend told me I absolutely have to come check it out, and I have to admit, she was right. You did a really good job with this place."
2,6,LANDLORD,Good to meetcha.  Quite a gal you've got here.
2,6,JO,"So, did you already check out that apartment? The one for rent."
2,6,DEAN,Yeah. Yes. Loved it.  Heh. Great flow.
2,6,LANDLORD,How'd you get in?
2,6,DEAN,It was open.
2,6,JO,"Now, Ed, um, when did the last tenant move out?"
2,6,LANDLORD,"Oh, about a month ago. Cut and run, too. Stick me for the rent."
2,6,JO,"Well. Her loss, our gain!  'Cause if Dean-o loves it, it's good enough for me."
2,6,JO,I'll flip you for the sofa.
2,6,DEAN,Does your mother even know you're here?
2,6,JO,Told her I was going to Vegas.
2,6,DEAN,You think she's gonna buy that?
2,6,JO,I'm not an idiot. I got Ash to lay a credit card trail all the way to the casinos.
2,6,DEAN,"You know, you shouldn't lie to your mom. Shouldn't be here either."
2,6,JO,"Well, I am. So untwist your boxers and deal with it."
2,6,SAM,"Where'd you get all that money from, anyways?"
2,6,JO,"Working, at the Roadhouse."
2,6,DEAN,Hunters don't tip that well.
2,6,JO,"Well, they aren't that good at poker, either."
2,6,DEAN,Yeah.
2,6,ELLEN'S VOICE,Is she with you?
2,6,DEAN,"Oh, hi Ellen."
2,6,ELLEN,She left a note she's in Vegas. I don't believe it for a second.
2,6,ELLEN'S VOICE,Dean?
2,6,DEAN,I haven't seen her.
2,6,ELLEN'S VOICE,You sure about that?
2,6,DEAN,"Yeah, I'm sure."
2,6,ELLEN,"Well, please. If she shows up, you'll drag her butt right back here, won't you?"
2,6,DEAN,Absolutely.
2,6,ELLEN,"Okay. Thanks, honey."
2,6,JO,"This place was built in 1924. It was originally a warehouse, converted into apartments a few months ago."
2,6,DEAN,Yeah? What was here before 1924.
2,6,JO,Nothing. Empty field.
2,6,SAM,"So, most likely scenario, someone died bloody in the building, and now he's back and raising hell."
2,6,JO,"Obituaries, mortuary reports and seven other sources. I know what I'm doing."
2,6,DEAN,I think the jury's still out on that one. Could you put the knife down?
2,6,SAM,"Okay!  So, uh, it's something else, then. Maybe some kind of cursed object that brought a spirit with it."
2,6,JO,"Well, we've got to scan the whole building. Everywhere we can get to, right?"
2,6,DEAN,"Right. So. You and me, we'll take the top two floors."
2,6,JO,We'd move faster if we split up.
2,6,DEAN,"Oh, this isn't negotiable."
2,6,JO,So. You gonna buy me dinner?
2,6,DEAN,What are you talking about?
2,6,JO,It's just if you're gonna ride me this close it's only decent you buy me dinner.
2,6,DEAN,"Oh, that's hilarious.  You know, it's bad enough I lied to your mom, but if you think I'm letting you out of my sight... I don't know if you've noticed, but you're kind of the spirit's type."
2,6,JO,Exactly.
2,6,DEAN,You wanna be bait?
2,6,JO,Quickest way to draw it out and you know it.
2,6,DEAN,Oh.
2,6,JO,What?
2,6,DEAN,I'm so regretting this.
2,6,JO,"You know, I've had it up to here with your crap."
2,6,DEAN,Excuse me?
2,6,JO,Your chauvinist crap. You think women can't do the job.
2,6,DEAN,"Sweetheart, this ain't gender studies. Women can do the job fine. Amateurs can't. You have no experience. What you do have is a bunch of half-baked romantic notions that some barflies put in your head."
2,6,JO,Now you sound like my mother.
2,6,DEAN,"Oh, and that's a bad thing? Because let me tell you..."
2,6,JO,What?
2,6,DEAN,Forget it.
2,6,JO,"No, you started this."
2,6,DEAN,"Jo, you've got options. No one in their right mind chooses this life. My dad started me in this when I was so young... I wish I could do something else."
2,6,JO,You love the job.
2,6,DEAN,"Yeah, but I'm a little twisted."
2,6,JO,You don't think I'm a little twisted too?
2,6,DEAN,"Jo, you've got a mother that worries about you. Who wants something more for you. Those are good things. You don't throw things like that away. Might be hard to find later."
2,6,DEAN,What?
2,6,JO,I'm not sure.
2,6,DEAN,You smell that?
2,6,DEAN,No. Something else. I know it. I just can't put my finger on it.
2,6,DEAN,Mazel Tov. You just found your first spirit.
2,6,JO,It's inside the vent.
2,6,DEAN,Here.
2,6,DEAN,There's something in there. Here.
2,6,DEAN,Somebody's keeping souvenirs.
2,6,TERESA,"This building, I swear to God..."
2,6,TERESA,"Screw it, I'm out of here."
2,6,JO,"Morning, princess."
2,6,DEAN,Where's Sam?
2,6,JO,Went to get coffee.
2,6,DEAN,Ugh. My back. How'd you sleep on that big soft bed?
2,6,JO,I didn't. Just been going over everything.
2,6,DEAN,Here.
2,6,JO,What's this for?
2,6,DEAN,Work a hell of a lot better than that little pig-sticker you're twirling around.
2,6,JO,William Anthony Harvelle.
2,6,DEAN,I'm sorry. My mistake.
2,6,JO,He must have been proud.
2,6,DEAN,What about your dad?
2,6,JO,"I was still in pigtails when my dad died, but I remember him coming home from a hunt. He'd burst through that door like, like Steve McQueen or something. And he'd sweep me up in his arms, and I'd breathe in that old leather jacket of his. And my mom, who was sour and pissed from the minute he left, she started smiling again. And we were... we were a family. You wanna know why I want to do the job? For him. It's my way of being close to him. Now tell me what's wrong with that."
2,6,DEAN,Nothing.
2,6,DEAN,Where's the coffee?
2,6,SAM,There are cops outside. Another girl disappeared.
2,6,DEAN,"Teresa Ellis, Apartment 2F. Boyfriend reported her missing around dawn."
2,6,JO,And her apartment?
2,6,DEAN,"Cracks all over the plaster, walls, ceiling. There was ectoplasm, too."
2,6,SAM,"Well, between that and that tuft of hair I'd say this sucker's coming from the walls."
2,6,DEAN,But who is it? Building's history is totally clean.
2,6,DEAN,What do you mean?
2,6,JO,Check this out.
2,6,JO,It's where this building was built. Take a look at the one next door. The windows.
2,6,SAM,Bars.
2,6,DEAN,We're next door to a prison?
2,6,SAM,"Well, then, we need a list. All the people executed there."
2,6,JO,Ash is already on it.
2,6,SAM,A hundred fifty seven names?
2,6,DEAN,We've gotta narrow that down.
2,6,SAM,Yeah.
2,6,DEAN,Or else we're gonna be digging up a hell of a lot of stiffs.
2,6,SAM,Herman Webster Mudgett?
2,6,JO,Yeah?
2,6,SAM,Wasn't that H. H. Holmes' real name?
2,6,DEAN,You've gotta be kiddin' me.
2,6,DEAN,"Yep. Holmes was executed at Moyamensing, May 7, 1896."
2,6,SAM,"H. H. Holmes himself. Come on, I mean, what are the odds?"
2,6,JO,Who is this guy?
2,6,DEAN,"The term ""multi-murderer."" They coined it to describe Holmes. He was America's first serial killer, before anybody knew what a serial killer was."
2,6,SAM,"Yeah, he confessed to twenty seven murders, but some put the death toll at over a hundred."
2,6,JO,"Well, we just find the bones, salt 'em and burn 'em, right?"
2,6,SAM,"Well, it's not that easy. His body is buried in town, but it's encased in a couple tons of concrete."
2,6,JO,What? Why?
2,6,DEAN,"The story goes that he didn't want anybody mutilating his corpse. 'Cause, you know, that's what he used to do."
2,6,SAM,You know somethin'. We might have an even bigger problem than that.
2,6,JO,How does this get bigger?
2,6,SAM,"Holmes built an apartment building in Chicago. He called it the Murder Castle. The whole place was a death factory, they had, uh, trap doors, acid vats, quick line pits... he built these secret chambers inside the walls. He'd lock his victims in, keep them alive for days. Some he'd suffocate, others he'd let starve to death."
2,6,JO,So Teresa could still be alive. She could be inside these walls.
2,6,DEAN,"We need sledgehammers, crowbars. We've got to smash these walls, anywhere thick enough to hide a girl."
2,6,DEAN,It's too narrow. Can't go any further.
2,6,JO,Let me see.
2,6,JO,What?
2,6,DEAN,"I, uh, I wish the pipes were cleaner."
2,6,JO,Shut up. I can fit in there.
2,6,DEAN,You're not going in there by yourself.
2,6,JO,You got a better idea?
2,6,DEAN,You-
2,6,JO,Uh-huh.
2,6,DEAN,Where are you?
2,6,JO,On the north wall.
2,6,JO,I'm heading down some kind of air duct.
2,6,DEAN,"No, no, no, no, stay up here."
2,6,JO,"Look, we've gotta find this girl, don't we? I'm okay."
2,6,JO,Oh god.
2,6,DEAN,Jo!
2,6,SAM,Whoa.
2,6,DEAN,He's got Jo.
2,6,SAM,What? How'd that happen?
2,6,DEAN,I wasn't with her; I left her alone. Dammit!
2,6,SAM,"Hey, hey, look, we'll find her, all right?"
2,6,DEAN,Where?
2,6,SAM,Inside the walls.
2,6,DEAN,"We've been inside the walls all night. None of the other girls were there, she won't be either."
2,6,SAM,Look. We've just gotta take a beat and think about this. Maybe we got Holmes' M.O. wrong.
2,6,DEAN,"Yeah, well, we'd better friggin' think fast."
2,6,DEAN,Yeah.
2,6,ELLEN'S VOICE,You lied to me. She's there.
2,6,DEAN,Ellen.
2,6,ELLEN,"No - Ash told me everything. Man's a genius, but he folds like a cheap suit. Now you put my damn daughter on the phone."
2,6,DEAN,"She's gonna have to call you back, she's taking care of, uh, feminine business."
2,6,ELLEN,"Yeah, right. Where is she? Where is she?!"
2,6,DEAN,"Look, we'll get her back."
2,6,ELLEN,Get her back? Back from what?
2,6,DEAN,"The spirit we're hunting, it took her."
2,6,ELLEN,Oh my god.
2,6,DEAN,"She'll be okay, I promise."
2,6,ELLEN,You promise. That is not the first time I've heard that from a Winchester.
2,6,DEAN,What?
2,6,ELLEN,If anything happens to her...
2,6,DEAN,"It won't. I won't let it.  Ellen, I'm sorry, I really am."
2,6,ELLEN,I'm taking the first flight out. I'll be there in a few hours.
2,6,DEAN,Damnit!
2,6,SAM,"Don't beat yourself up, Dean. There's nothing you could have done."
2,6,DEAN,Tell me you've got something.
2,6,SAM,"Uh, maybe. Look. You look at the layout of the Holmes murder castle, there's all the torture chambers inside the walls, right?"
2,6,DEAN,Right.
2,6,SAM,But there's one we haven't considered yet. The one in this basement.
2,6,DEAN,This building doesn't have a basement.
2,6,SAM,"You're right, it doesn't. But I just noticed this. Beneath the foundation, it looks like part of an old sewer system that hasn't been used for —"
2,6,DEAN,Let's go.
2,6,JO,Hello?
2,6,JO,Your name's Teresa?
2,6,TERESA,Yes.
2,6,JO,"This won't make you feel better, but I'm here to rescue you."
2,6,TERESA,"Oh god. He's out there, he's gonna kill us!"
2,6,JO,"No, he won't. We're getting out. My friends are looking for us, they'll find us."
2,6,TERESA,"Oh god, he's here!"
2,6,JO,Shh! Just be quiet!
2,6,SAM,Here.
2,6,HOLMES,You're so pretty. So beautiful.
2,6,JO,Go to hell!
2,6,JO,"How do you like that? Pure iron, you creepy-ass son of a bitch!"
2,6,TERESA,Is he gone?
2,6,JO,I don't know. I...
2,6,HOLMES,Shhh.
2,6,DEAN,Hey!
2,6,DEAN,Jo?!
2,6,JO,I'm here!
2,6,SAM,"We're gonna get you out of here, all right?"
2,6,JO,Been better. Let's get the hell out of here before he comes back.
2,6,DEAN,"Actually, I don't think you're leaving here just yet."
2,6,JO,What?
2,6,DEAN,Remember when I said you being bait was a bad plan? Now it's kind of the only one we got.
2,6,DEAN,Now!
2,6,JO,"Scream all you want, you dick, but there's no way you're stepping over that salt!"
2,6,SAM,So? This job as glamorous as you thought it would be?
2,6,JO,"Well, except for all the pee-your-pants terror, yeah. Sure. But that Teresa girl's gonna live a life because of us. It's worth it, isn't it?"
2,6,SAM,Yeah. Yeah it is.
2,6,JO,"Hey, what if somebody finds that sewer down there, or a storm washes the salt away?"
2,6,SAM,Both very fine points. Which is why we're waiting here.
2,6,JO,For what?
2,6,JO,You ripped off a cement truck?
2,6,DEAN,"Boy, you, you really weren't kidding about flying out, were you?"
2,6,DEAN,How about we listen to some music?
2,6,SONG,You're as cold as ice...
2,6,DEAN,This is gonna be a long drive.
2,6,DEAN,"Ellen? This is my fault. Okay? I lied to you and I'm sorry. But Jo did good out there, I think her dad would be proud."
2,6,ELLEN,Don't you dare say that. Not you. I need a moment with my daughter. Alone.
2,6,JO,You're angry. I understand.
2,6,ELLEN,Angry? Angry doesn't begin to touch it.
2,6,JO,"Let's just think about this. Everything's okay, I'm alive..."
2,6,ELLEN,Not after I'm through with you.
2,6,JO,"Is this about me hunting, or something else?"
2,6,ELLEN,You let those boys use you as bait!
2,6,JO,"They were right there, backing me up the whole time."
2,6,ELLEN,"That is why you do not have the sense to do this job, you're trusting your life to them."
2,6,JO,What are you talking about?
2,6,ELLEN,"Like father, like sons, that is what I'm talking about."
2,6,JO,John? I thought you and John were friends.
2,6,ELLEN,"Yeah, we were, I'm sorry, I didn't mean..."
2,6,JO,Mom? What aren't you telling me?
2,6,DEAN,"That bad, huh?"
2,6,JO,Not right now.
2,6,DEAN,"What happened? Hey, talk to me."
2,6,JO,Get off me!
2,6,DEAN,Sorry. See you around.
2,6,JO,"Dean. It turns out my dad had a partner on his last hunt. Funny, he usually worked alone; this guy did too, but... I guess my father figured he could trust him. Mistake. Guy screwed up, got my dad killed."
2,6,DEAN,What does this have to do with—
2,6,JO,"It was your father, Dean."
2,6,DEAN,What?
2,6,JO,"Why do you think John never came back? Never told you about us? Because he couldn't look my mom in the eye after that, that's why."
2,6,DEAN,Jo.
2,6,JO,"Just... just get out of here.  Please, just leave."
2,8,SAM,What?
2,9,END TEASER,
2,12,GUARD,Thank you.  Thank you.
2,12,SAM,Sure.
2,12,GUARD,... Thank you.
2,12,DEAN,Yeah?
2,15,SAM (voiceover),"So, we checked it ourselves."
2,17,[FADE IN,"SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA. INT. BAR. NIGHT. A young woman, MADISON, is grabbing drinks with her friends. Her co-worker, NATE MULLIGAN, approaches.]"
2,17,NATE,"Hey, Maddie. Listen, I hate to pull you away, but I’m gonna need you to come back to the office with me."
2,17,MADISON,Really? [Her friends begin smirking.]
2,17,NATE,Yeah. Turns out I’ve gotta file those docs by midnight—
2,17,MADISON,Midnight?
2,17,NATE,"Yeah, I’m gonna need you to, um…[he sees that she is smiling] This isn’t working at all, is it?"
2,17,MADISON,"[laughing] No, it’s not, Nate."
2,17,NATE,"Listen, I’ve had a couple. I shouldn’t really drive. Could you just give me a lift—"
2,17,MADISON,"I already called you a cab. [smiling] I’ll see you in the morning. [NATE smiles briefly, then gives up and walks away; MADISON and her friends start cracking up.]"
2,17,FRIEND,That happen a lot?
2,17,MADISON,Only on the days that end with a “y”.
2,17,FRIEND,You okay?
2,17,MADISON,"Yeah. [When she looks again, the man is gone.] I’ve gotta go."
2,17,[CUT TO,"STREET. MADISON is walking quickly to her car. She hears a crashing noise behind her, but when she stops, she sees nothing. She continues walking nervously to her car.  Once she reaches her car and drives away, the mysterious man immediately begins following her, watching her leave.]"
2,17,[CUT TO,"INT. OFFICE BUILDING. MORNING. MADISON is filling the coffee pot at the water cooler. She stops, suddenly, when she notices blood on the door to NATE’S office. She goes to the door and pushes it open. A trail of blood on the rug leads to the desk, where NATE is lying, dead. His entire chest has been ripped apart, leaving blood everywhere. Screaming, MADISON drops the coffee pot, shattering it to pieces.]"
2,17,[FADE IN,INT. MORGUE. SAM watches as the employee slides NATE’S corpse from his compartment.]
2,17,EMPLOYEE,"Here he is, Detective. [NATE has stitches running along his chest, stomach, shoulders, and throat.]"
2,17,SAM,That’s a pretty nasty bite.
2,17,EMPLOYEE,Mm-hmm.
2,17,SAM,You know what bit him?
2,17,EMPLOYEE,[averting her eyes] I haven’t quite determined that just yet.
2,17,SAM,"Come on, Doc. Off the record."
2,17,EMPLOYEE,"Okay, way, way off the record ...."
2,17,SAM,Sure.
2,17,EMPLOYEE,"If I didn’t know better, I’d say the guy was attacked by a wolf. But unless I know that the zoo is missing one of their lobos, I’m going with pit bull. [eyeing him] I like my job."
2,17,SAM,"[chuckling] Yeah, I hear you. One more thing. This guy –- was his heart missing?"
2,17,EMPLOYEE,"Yeah, how did you know that? I haven’t even finished my report."
2,17,SAM,Lucky guess.
2,17,[CUT TO,INT. MOTEL ROOM.]
2,17,DEAN,[cleaning his guns] This lawyer guy the first heart-free corpse in town?
2,17,DEAN,But no hearts?
2,17,SAM,"No hearts. They were all hookers working Hunter’s Point. Now, cops are trying to keep things under wrap, but they’re looking for a serial killer."
2,17,DEAN,And the lunar cycle?
2,17,SAM,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, month after month, all the murders happen in the week leading up to the full moon."
2,17,DEAN,"Which is this week, right?"
2,17,SAM,Hence the lawyer.
2,17,DEAN,Awesome.
2,17,SAM,"Dean, could you be a bigger geek about this?"
2,17,DEAN,"I’m sorry, man, but what about “a human by day, a freak animal killing machine by moonlight” don’t you understand? I mean, werewolves are badass. We haven’t seen one since we were kids."
2,17,SAM,"Okay, Sparky. And you know what? After we kill it, we can go to Disneyland."
2,17,DEAN,"You know what the best part about it is? We already know how to bring these suckers down. [holding up a silver bullet] One of these bad boys right to the heart. So, what’s our next move?"
2,17,SAM,Talk to the girl who found the body.
2,17,[CUT TO,INT. MADISON’S APARTMENT. She lets SAM and DEAN inside.]
2,17,MADISON,I don’t understand. I already gave my statement.
2,17,SAM,"Right, well, we just need to verify a few things."
2,17,MADISON,"This is my neighbor, Glen. Glen, this is Detective…"
2,17,DEAN,"Landis. And Detective Dante. [He pats SAM on the back. GLEN, a bearded man wearing a “Mission Church” T-shirt, stands.]"
2,17,GLEN,"Well, I guess I’ll leave you to it."
2,17,MADISON,Okay. Thanks for the casserole.
2,17,DEAN,"Oh, how thoughtful."
2,17,GLEN,Just call if you need anything. [They watch GLEN leave.]
2,17,MADISON,He’s sweet. He came over to check on me. Have – have a seat.
2,17,SAM,"You must be pretty shaken up. You were Nate Mulligan’s assistant, right?"
2,17,MADISON,"For two years, yeah."
2,17,DEAN,"So, you knew all about him?"
2,17,MADISON,Probably knew more about him than he did. Nate was…(smiles) he was nice.
2,17,SAM,But?
2,17,MADISON,"Nothing, really. I – He had a few scotches in him, and he'd started hitting on anyone in a five-mile radius. You know the type. [SAM notices DEAN practically salivating over her.]"
2,17,SAM,"Yeah. I do, actually."
2,17,DEAN,"[his lecherous grin fades as he hears SAM's tone, and he becomes serious] Did, uh, did he have any enemies?"
2,17,MADISON,What do you mean? It sure looked like an animal attack.
2,17,DEAN,"No, yeah, we’re just covering all the bases. Anyone that might have had a beef with him – a former client, an ex? [SAM notices her think of somebody.]"
2,17,SAM,What?
2,17,MADISON,"Well, this is embarrassing, but my ex-boyfriend, Kurt—"
2,17,DEAN,Kurt have a last name?
2,17,MADISON,"Mueller. After we broke up, he went kind of nuts. He’s… well, he’s kind of been stalking me. He got it in his head that something was going on between Nate and I. He showed up at my office."
2,17,SAM,What happened?
2,17,MADISON,"Kurt got into it with Nate, threw a punch before security grabbed him. I was lucky to keep my job."
2,17,DEAN,When was the last time you saw Kurt?
2,17,MADISON,"A few nights ago. Actually, the night Nate died. We were all grabbing drinks at this bar, and Kurt showed up."
2,17,DEAN,And?
2,17,MADISON,Nothing. It was ... like he was watching me. Then he was gone. To tell you the truth… he scares me.
2,17,[CUT TO,EXT. APARTMENT.]
2,17,DEAN,"So, what do you think?"
2,17,SAM,Stalker ex-boyfriend? He hates the boss. And he was there that night.
2,17,DEAN,Think he’s our dog-faced boy?
2,17,SAM,"Well, it’s a theory."
2,17,DEAN,We’ve had worse.
2,17,SAM,Yeah.
2,17,DEAN,What do you say we pay Kurt a visit?
2,17,[CUT TO,"INT. KURT’S APARTMENT. DEAN picks the lock, and they enter. While they are looking through the kitchen, the point of view changes to that of an animal, watching them from the corner.]"
2,17,SAM,Anything?
2,17,DEAN,"[closing the fridge] No, nothing but leftovers and a six-pack."
2,17,SAM,Check the freezer. Maybe there’s some human hearts behind the Haagen-Dazs or something.
2,17,DEAN,"Sam, come here! [SAM joins him.] Check it out."
2,17,[CUT TO,STREET. A policeman is walking around and hears a crash nearby.]
2,17,POLICEMAN,Somebody there?
2,17,SAM,I’ll call 911.
2,17,DEAN,I’d say Kurt’s looking more and more like our Cujo.
2,17,SAM,"Dean, if he’s out here, we better check on Madison."
2,17,[CUT TO,"MADISON’S APARTMENT. The boys knock on her front door. Across the hall, GLEN opens his door to see the commotion.]"
2,17,GLEN,What’s going on?
2,17,DEAN,"Police business, Glen. [MADISON answers the door.]"
2,17,MADISON,What is it?
2,17,SAM,"[glancing at Glen] Well, maybe we should talk privately."
2,17,[CUT TO,INT. MADISON’S KITCHEN. She is pouring the boys coffee.]
2,17,SAM,Has Kurt been here?
2,17,MADISON,Not exactly.
2,17,DEAN,What exactly does “not exactly” mean?
2,17,MADISON,"Well, he was outside last night. Just…looking. Just looking at me. [The boys exchange a look.] Has he done something?"
2,17,SAM,We’re not really sure.
2,17,DEAN,"It’s probably nothing, but… we just don’t wanna take any chances. In fact, one of us should probably stay here with you? Just in case he stops by. Where does he work?"
2,17,MADISON,He owns a body shop.
2,17,DEAN,You mind grabbing that address for us? [She nods and leaves the room.] Thanks.
2,17,SAM,"All right, you go. I’ll stay."
2,17,DEAN,Forget that. You go after the creepy ex. I’m gonna hang here with the hot chick.
2,17,SAM,"Dude, why do you always get to hang out with the girls?"
2,17,DEAN,'Cause I’m older.
2,17,SAM,"No, screw that. We settle this the old-fashioned way."
2,17,DEAN,"Shut up, shut up. Two out of three."
2,17,SAM,"Bundle up out there, all right?"
2,17,MADISON,Um… do you wanna sit on the couch?
2,17,SAM,"No. No, no. I’m okay."
2,17,MADISON,It’s more comfortable.
2,17,SAM,"Ah, I’m fine."
2,17,SAM,"You know, I think I will sit on the couch. [MADISON smiles. SAM sits there awkwardly until his phone rings. He answers.]"
2,17,DEAN,"[from the street] Let me guess. You’re sitting on her couch like a stiff, trying to think of something to say."
2,17,SAM,Did you find Kurt?
2,17,DEAN,"No, he hasn’t been at work all week. But because I’m good, and I mean really, really good, I got a line on where he might be.  [DEAN gets into the car.]  What’s she wearing?"
2,17,SAM,"Bye, Dean. [He hangs up.]"
2,17,DEAN,"[chuckling] Oh, Sammy."
2,17,MADISON,I saw that.
2,17,SAM,Saw what?
2,17,SAM,"Wait, so, so, Kendall married Ethan’s father, just to get back at him?"
2,17,MADISON,Yup. And now she’s set to inherit all the casinos that were supposed to go to Ethan.
2,17,SAM,What a bitch!
2,17,MADISON,"Admit it, you’re hooked."
2,17,SAM,"No, no, no, no, no, no. I wouldn’t say I’m hooked. [She giggles.] You know, can I ask you a question? It’s – it's a little personal."
2,17,MADISON,You’ve seen my entire underwear collection. Go ahead.
2,17,MADISON,Uh-huh.
2,17,SAM,What were you doing with Kurt?
2,17,MADISON,"[after a pause] I don’t know. I mean, it’s not like he introduced himself, like, “Hi, I’m possessive and controlling and I like to punch people. Wanna be my girlfriend?”"
2,17,SAM,"Yeah, well, I guess we all make mistakes."
2,17,MADISON,"Yeah, well, mine’s wanted by the police.  [pause]  You wanna know why I stayed with him? Really? [He nods.] I was too insecure to leave."
2,17,SAM,"I find that hard to believe. I mean, you don’t really seem like the type."
2,17,MADISON,"Yeah, well, some stuff happened. My life changed, I changed. For the better, I think."
2,17,SAM,What happened?
2,17,MADISON,"Well, for one thing, I got mugged."
2,17,SAM,[surprised] And that’s supposed to be a good thing?
2,17,MADISON,"[laughing] I know, it sounds strange. And don’t get me wrong, it rattled me. But – then it hit me. I could keep feeling sorry for myself, or I could take control of my life. I chose the latter. First thing I did was tell Kurt he had to go."
2,17,SAM,Smart move.
2,17,MADISON,"Apparently. Everything else just opened up, blossomed. It’s all been wonderful, really. [SAM shrugs.] What? Doesn’t everybody think that being a victim of random violence is the best thing that ever happened to them?"
2,17,SAM,"[laughing] Yeah, not so much. [pause] You’re … unusual. [awkwardly]"
2,17,MADISON,"Unusual, like … [she circles her finger, pointing to her head, meaning ""crazy""] unusual?"
2,17,SAM,"No. No. No, no, no. Unusual, like … impressive. [earnestly]"
2,17,MADISON,You think so?
2,17,SAM,Sorry. [He answers.] Hey.
2,17,DEAN,[at a strip club] I found him.
2,17,SAM,"Good, don’t take your eyes off him."
2,17,DEAN,"Oh, yeah, my eyes are glued. Look, Sammy, I gotta let you go. I, uh, I don’t wanna ... don't wanna miss anything. [He hands the stripper a dollar bill and hangs up, smirking.]"
2,17,[CUT TO,"MADISON’S APARTMENT. NIGHT. She joins SAM in the living room, while he watches the full moon from the window.]"
2,17,MADISON,"So, um … I’m gonna turn in."
2,17,SAM,"Okay, yeah. Well, I’ll be here."
2,17,MADISON,Okay.
2,17,SAM,"You know, if you hear anything, I mean if you wake up, just – just call out. [He fidgets awkwardly.]"
2,17,MADISON,Okay.
2,17,SAM,"Okay. [She smiles uncomfortably and goes into her bedroom. SAM sighs, frustrated with himself.]"
2,17,DEAN,What the—?
2,17,SAM,"Dean, you okay?"
2,17,DEAN,"Yeah, now that I’m conscious. The werewolf knocked me out. Sam, it’s Madison."
2,17,SAM,What?
2,17,DEAN,"Yeah, awesome job of keeping an eye on her."
2,17,SAM,"Dean, I’ve been here the whole time. She’s in bed, asleep."
2,17,DEAN,"Well, she wasn’t an hour ago. Check her right arm below her elbow. I nicked her with a silver knife."
2,17,MADISON,Morning.
2,17,MADISON,"Um… where are my pajamas? [SAM, upset, leaves the bedroom.] Sam? What’s going on? Where are you going? [She jumps out of bed, wrapping the comforter around her, and follows him to the living room, where he is locking the front door.]"
2,17,SAM,I’m not going anywhere. And neither are you.
2,17,MADISON,"You’re psychotic. The whole “I’m a cop” trip – God, I am so stupid."
2,17,SAM,"Well, I guess neither of us are who we said we were, huh?"
2,17,MADISON,"Sam, you’re sick, okay? You’re imagining things. Monsters don’t exist, not really."
2,17,SAM,You know what? Save the act.
2,17,MADISON,"[crying] It’s not an act! I am not a werewolf! There’s no such thing! It’s made up, all right? Th– They’re not real! You know they’re not real!"
2,17,SAM,No?! [pointing to her wound] Then where did that come from?
2,17,MADISON,"I don’t know! Sam, God, you need help. Please, don’t do something that you’re gonna regret. I’m not what you think I am. I’m not."
2,17,DEAN,"How you doin’? My head feels great, thanks."
2,17,SAM,We’ve gotta talk. [He brings DEAN into another room.] She says she has no idea what I’m talking about.
2,17,DEAN,She’s lying.
2,17,SAM,"Or maybe she really doesn’t know she’s changing, you know? Maybe – maybe when the creature takes over, she blacks out."
2,17,DEAN,"[deadpan] Like a really hot Incredible Hulk. Come on, dude, she ganked her boss and her ex-boyfriend. That doesn’t sound rash and unconscious."
2,17,SAM,"Yeah, but what if it was, Dean? I mean, what if some animal part of her brain saw both those guys as threats? Hell, the cop, too."
2,17,DEAN,"What are you, the Dog Whisperer now?"
2,17,SAM,"Look, man, I just… I don’t know, there, there, there was something in her eyes."
2,17,DEAN,"Yeah, she’s killing people!"
2,17,SAM,But if she has no control over it—
2,17,DEAN,"Exactly. She can’t control it. Even if she’s telling the truth, it’s not gonna change anything."
2,17,SAM,I’m not putting a bullet through some girl’s chest who has no idea what’s happening.
2,17,DEAN,"Sam, she’s a monster, and you’re feeling sorry for her?"
2,17,SAM,"Maybe I understand her. [pause] Look, there might be another way we can get the job done without having to waste her."
2,17,DEAN,Are you thinking what I think you’re thinking?
2,17,SAM,"[flipping through the journal] Dad’s theory – “lycanthropy might have a cure if you kill the werewolf who bit you, severing the bloodline”."
2,17,DEAN,MIGHT have a cure. Meaning “who the hell knows?”
2,17,SAM,It’s worth a shot.
2,17,DEAN,"We don’t even know where to start looking, all right? I mean, the puppy that bit her could be anyone, anywhere. It could’ve been years ago."
2,17,SAM,[realizing something] No. I don’t think so.
2,17,SAM,"Madison, when were you mugged? [She doesn't want to answer, just looking at him.]  Please. It’s important, all right? Just answer the question."
2,17,MADISON,About a month ago.
2,17,SAM,Did you see the guy?
2,17,MADISON,No. He grabbed me from behind.
2,17,SAM,Did he bite you?
2,17,MADISON,[after a pause] How did you know that?
2,17,SAM,Where?
2,17,MADISON,"On, on the back of my neck. [SAM shows her that he is setting his gun down, and goes behind her, gently brushing her hair away and exposing a scarred lump the size of a golf ball on her neck.]"
2,17,DEAN,"Oh, that’s just a love bite. Believe me, that could have been a lot worse. Where were you at the time?"
2,17,MADISON,Walking home from a friend’s loft.
2,17,SAM,Let me guess. Not too far from Hunter’s Point?
2,17,SAM,"The same place where those other murders happened. I’m telling you, it’s a werewolf’s hunting grounds."
2,17,DEAN,"Maybe, but that doesn’t mean it’s gonna be out there tonight."
2,17,SAM,"It’s the right time of the lunar cycle. Look, I know it’s a long shot."
2,17,DEAN,"Hey, you’re forgetting something. Maddie’s probably gonna turn soon, all right? We can’t just let her take off to an all-you-can-eat buffet."
2,17,SAM,I’ll stay with her.
2,17,DEAN,And if she busts loose? [No response] Sam?
2,17,SAM,I’ll do it.
2,17,DEAN,Sam.
2,17,SAM,"I’ll shoot her, all right? But Dean, I need you to go out there. At least go look for the thing. Dean, please. We can save this girl."
2,17,DEAN,"[after a pause, realizing that SAM is feeling more intensely than usual] Fine."
2,17,MADISON,Please. Just let me go.
2,17,SAM,"Look … I know you’re scared. I also know that there’s no way in hell you’re gonna believe me. But I’m doing this because I’m trying to help you. I’m not gonna lie, all right, the odds aren’t exactly in our favor. But if this goes the way I pray it does … I’ll untie you, and I’ll walk out that door, and I’ll never come back. You’ll live the rest of your life. And I’ll just be a bad memory.  [SAM is emotional, tearful, as is MADISON.]"
2,17,[CUT TO,"HUNTER’S POINT. NIGHT. A woman, clearly a hooker, is walking the dark street alone. She stops when she hears an animal howling, and looks nervous.]"
2,17,[CUT TO,"MADISON’S APARTMENT. SAM is watching the full moon while MADISON sits in the chair. Suddenly, her fingernails grow, stretching into claws. Her eyes turn bright blue and she bares her fangs. SAM turns just as she breaks loose from the chair. She knocks him to the ground, but he quickly gets up, aiming his gun.]"
2,17,[CUT TO,"HUNTER’S POINT. The hooker is running down the street when suddenly, she comes face-to-face with the animal. The audience watches from the animal’s perspective as it chases her down the street.]"
2,17,[CUT TO,"MADISON’S APARTMENT. SAM keeps his gun aimed at MADISON. Just as she lunges at him, he moves out of the way, forcing her into her bedroom. He moves the entertainment center in front of the door, trapping her inside.]"
2,17,[CUT TO,"HUNTER’S POINT. The werewolf catches up with the hooker, dragging her screaming across the pavement.]"
2,17,DEAN,Hey!
2,17,DEAN,"Hey, don’t mention it!"
2,17,GLEN,"It happened ... again.   Where am I? H–help me. Oh, God. Oh my God.  [GLEN coughs.]"
2,17,DEAN,"All right, easy, Glen. Just take it easy. [He watches as GLEN dies, his eyes glazing over.]"
2,17,[CUT TO,MADISON’S APARTMENT. MORNING. She wakes up (dressed) as SAM opens the bedroom door.]
2,17,SAM,It should be over now. You’ll never see me again.
2,17,DEAN,"It was sort of sad, actually. Glen had no clue what was going on. Hey, why do you think he turned Madison instead of just killing her in the first place?"
2,17,SAM,"I don’t know. I mean, he kind of seemed to have a thing for her."
2,17,DEAN,"Maybe his primal instinct did, too. Maybe he was looking for a little, uh, hot breeding action."
2,17,SAM,Yeah. Something like that.
2,17,DEAN,So?
2,17,SAM,So what?
2,17,DEAN,Speaking of Madison …?
2,17,SAM,"Oh, whatever."
2,17,DEAN,"Don’t “whatever” me, man, you liked her. Maybe, uh—"
2,17,SAM,"Dean, she thought I was a stark-raving lunatic."
2,17,DEAN,You saved her life.
2,17,SAM,"Yeah, but she doesn’t know that. [MADISON appears at the window.]"
2,17,MADISON,"You know, for a stake-out, your car’s a bit conspicuous. What are you still doing here?"
2,17,DEAN,"Honestly? Uh, we’re pretty sure you’re not gonna turn tonight, but we’ve gotta be a hundred percent, so… you know, we’re ... lurking."
2,17,SAM,I know this sounds crazy.
2,17,MADISON,"Sure does. Well, if we’re gonna wait it out… we might as well do it together."
2,17,MADISON,"You were telling the truth, weren’t you? About everything. What you did – it was to help me."
2,17,SAM,Yeah.
2,17,MADISON,I did all of those horrible things … when I turned.
2,17,SAM,You didn’t know.
2,17,MADISON,"[after a pause] So, when will we know for sure? Moonrise?"
2,17,SAM,"No, I don’t think so. You turned middle of the night last night. I think we’ve gotta hang in until sun-up."
2,17,DEAN,"Well, it looks like we’ve got ourselves a few hours to kill. Poker, anyone?"
2,17,DEAN,"Oh, no, you guys talk."
2,17,MADISON,Does – does this mean it worked?
2,17,SAM,[relieved] Yeah. I think so.
2,17,MADISON,"[sighing in relief] Oh, God, thank you. Thank you so much. [She gives SAM a hug. DEAN clears his throat, and they pull away.] [MADISON laughs] You, too, Dean. Thank you."
2,17,DEAN,"Aw, don’t mention it. [awkward pause] So, I’m just gonna head back to the hotel and … watch some Pay-Per-View, or something. [He leaves the apartment, pumping his fist in the air as he leaves.]"
2,17,MADISON,"That was smooth, heh."
2,17,SAM,"He means well, but…"
2,17,MADISON,"You mean, he thinks you’re gonna get laid."
2,17,SAM,"Look, I—"
2,17,MADISON,It’s okay.
2,17,SAM,"No. I know I scared the crap out of you, all right? I–I mean, I tied you to a chair."
2,17,MADISON,That’s right up there with me scratching up your face.
2,17,SAM,"There’s just no way ... we could go back, you know?  Before it happened."
2,17,MADISON,You’re right. There’s just no way.
2,17,[CUT TO,"MOTEL. SAM runs down the hall to DEAN’S room, pounding on the door. DEAN answers.]"
2,17,SAM,[breathless] She – she turned.
2,17,DEAN,What?
2,17,SAM,I couldn’t grab her in time.
2,17,DEAN,"We’ll find her, Sammy."
2,17,[CUT TO,EXT. MOTEL BUILDING. DAYTIME ]
2,17,SAM,I already called Bobby. He doesn’t know anything. Except he knew severing the bloodline wouldn’t work. That’s everyone. They all say it’s impossible to reverse it.
2,17,DEAN,How come she didn’t turn when we were with her?
2,17,SAM,Dean—
2,17,DEAN,"So, what, you put her to bed and then she wolfed out? Maybe she’s gotta be asleep to turn."
2,17,SAM,"What the hell does it matter, Dean? Look, we’ve gotta find some way to help her, some legend we missed or something."
2,17,DEAN,"If there was, don’t you think someone we know would’ve known it?"
2,17,SAM,"Well, then we have to look harder! Until we find something."
2,17,DEAN,"Sammy, I don’t think we’ve got a choice here anymore."
2,17,SAM,What?
2,17,DEAN,"I hate to say it. She’s a sweet girl, but part of her is—"
2,17,SAM,Evil?
2,17,DEAN,Yeah.
2,17,SAM,"Yeah, that’s what they say about me, Dean! So me you won’t kill, but her you’re just gonna blow away?"
2,17,SAM,"Madison, where are you?"
2,17,MADISON,[from a phone booth] I don’t – I don't – I don't know where I am.
2,17,SAM,"Well, do you see any street signs?"
2,17,MADISON,"Um … yeah, yeah, Middle Point."
2,17,SAM,"All right, hold on, Maddie. We’re coming to get you, just stay where you are."
2,17,[CUT TO,MADISON’S APARTMENT. The three of them are in the living room. The gun is sitting on the table.]
2,17,MADISON,I don’t remember anything. I probably killed someone last night.  Didn’t I?
2,17,DEAN,There’s no way to know yet.
2,17,MADISON,Is there something else we can try to make it go away?
2,17,SAM,"We’ll find something. I mean, there’s gotta be some answer, somewhere."
2,17,DEAN,"That’s not entirely true. Madison, you deserve to know. We’ve scoured every source. There’s just no cure."
2,17,MADISON,[to Sam] Is – is he right?
2,17,DEAN,"Well, we could lock you up at night, but … you bust out, and some night you will, someone else dies. [pause]  I’m sorry. I am."
2,17,MADISON,"[crying] [exhales] So, I guess that’s all there is to it, then."
2,17,SAM,Stop it. Don’t talk like that.
2,17,MADISON,"Sam, I don’t wanna hurt anyone else. I don’t wanna hurt you. [She picks up the gun and brings it to him.]"
2,17,SAM,Put that down.
2,17,MADISON,I can’t do it myself. I need you to help me.
2,17,SAM,"Madison, no."
2,17,MADISON,Sam… I’m a monster.
2,17,SAM,"You don’t have to be. We could find a way, all right?  I can. I’m gonna save you."
2,17,MADISON,"[crying harder] You tried. I know you tried. But this is all there is left. Help me, Sam. I want you to do it. I want it to be you."
2,17,SAM,I can’t.
2,17,MADISON,I don’t wanna die. I don’t. But I can’t live like this. This is the way you can save me. Please. I’m asking you to save me.
2,17,[MUSIC,"Queensryche's ""Silent Lucidity""]"
2,17,DEAN,Sam. [holding up the gun] I’m sorry.
2,17,SAM,"[with tears in his eyes] No, you’re right. She’s right."
2,17,DEAN,"Sammy, I got this one. I’ll do it."
2,17,SAM,She asked me to.
2,17,DEAN,You don’t have to.
2,17,SAM,"[tears sliding out his eyes] Yes, I do. Please. [He holds his hand out for the gun, tears streaming down his face. DEAN hands it to him.] Just wait here."

2,19,WORKER #1:,[to BLOWTORCH GUY] You got that ready?
2,19,WORKER #1:,Yikes. Would’ve hate to have gotten thrown in here.

2,19,GUARD:,"Randall, turn out your light and go to sleep. I’m not going to say it again."
2,19,GUARD:,"Lights out, B-Block."
2,19,GUARD:,No…no…No! No! Nooo! No! No! Nooo! Aah! Nooooo!

2,19,PHOTOGRAPHER:,Front.
2,19,PHOTOGRAPHER:,To the right.
2,19,DEAN:,I call this one the Blue Steel.
2,19,PHOTOGRAPHER:,"Yeah, that’s right."
2,19,PHOTOGRAPHER:,To the right.
2,19,PHOTOGRAPHER:,"All right, back to the lineup."
2,19,DEAN:,"Wait, who looks better, me or Nick Nolte?"
2,19,PHOTOGRAPHER:,Shut up.
2,19,DEAN:,"Well, it’s about time. I’ll have a cheeseburger. Extra onions."
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,You think you’re funny.
2,19,DEAN:,I think I’m adorable.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"It is a pleasure to finally meet you in person, Dean. (On hearing this, Dean's smile freezes.) I’m Special Agent Victor Henriksen. This is my partner, Special Agent Reidy."
2,19,DEAN:,"[still smiling, but looking a bit worried] Henriksen? Not the Milwaukee agent Henriksen?"
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,Live and in person.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"Oh, nice shot. [He tosses the picture onto the table.] You can hang that up in your cell at Super Max."
2,19,DEAN:,"All right, maybe we can just forget the cheeseburger, huh?"
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"Oh, yeah. Keep that game face on. Try and cover how up cornered you are. [to REIDY] Read him the charges."
2,19,REIDY:,"Well, we got mail fraud, credit card fraud, grave desecration..."
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,Skip to the good ones.
2,19,REIDY:,"Armed robbery, kidnapping and, oh, three counts of first-degree murder."
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"And after Milwaukee your brother is now a suspect in a murder case himself. I’d say for you two, ""screwed to hell"" is a major understatement."
2,19,DEAN:,"Well, where there’s life there’s hope, huh?"
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"[Makes a noise of assent] See? That’s what I kept thinking as I was searching for your asses all over hell and gone. [He leans forward on the table, speaking softly.] Your dad taught you well. The way you cover your tracks and after Milwaukee the way you [He whistles and moves his hand to the side, mimicking disappearing] vanished. [DEAN laughs softly.] Near went nuts trying to find you. Ask him."
2,19,REIDY:,[Deadpans] He near went nuts.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"And after all of that, you get tripped up on a motion detector. Pretty rookie move. Gotta say I was… surprised."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,Dean Winchester?
2,19,DEAN:,In the flesh.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,And you are?
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,"Mara Daniels, Public Defender’s office. [She shakes hands with DEAN.] I’ve been assigned you and your brother’s case."
2,19,DEAN:,Huh.
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,Are you Henriksen?
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"Yeah, and we’re not quite done here."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,"Ah, yeah. You are. And if you don’t mind, I would like to meet with my clients. Privately."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,Unfortunately your arraignment on the breaking and entering charge won’t be until Tuesday.
2,19,DEAN:,And they’ll keep us in the county jail?
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,That’s right.
2,19,SAM:,Green River County Detention Center?
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,"Yes. And considering the charges you’re facing, no judge in his right mind is going to grant you bail."
2,19,DEAN:,"Yeah, we figured that."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,"Extradition papers have already been filed from five separate states, Missouri and Wisconsin being the biggest concern – the bank robbery and the murder raps."
2,19,SAM:,How long can we stall extradition?
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,A week. Maybe less.
2,19,GUARD (V-O):,"All right, let’s go. Watch your step. Come on, keep moving."
2,19,PRISONER:,"You’re mine, baby!"
2,19,DEAN:,"Don’t worry, Sam. I promise I won’t trade you for smokes."
2,19,DEAN:,I call top bunk!
2,19,DEAN:,Okay.
2,19,DEAN:,"[in a low voice to SAM, who is standing behind him] My roommate doesn't say much – how's yours?"
2,19,SAM:,[quietly] Just keeps staring at me... in a way that makes me ... really uneasy.
2,19,DEAN:,It sounds like you're making new friends.
2,19,SAM:,"Dean. This is, without a doubt, the dumbest, craziest thing we've ever done. And that's in a long, storied career of dumb and crazy."
2,19,DEAN:,Calm down. It's all part of the plan.
2,19,SAM:,Oh really? So Henriksen showing up was part of the plan?
2,19,DEAN:,"Yeah, that guy moves a little faster than I thought. Look, all we gotta do is find this ghost, put the sucker down... then grab ourselves a couple of teardrop tattoos."
2,19,SAM:,"That's not funny. Dean, what about this escape plan? It –"
2,19,DEAN:,"It's 100 percent sure. I wouldn't have gone if it wasn't. I mean, come on, man, this place has all the signs of a haunting. Innocent people are dead. Four so far."
2,19,SAM:,"[laughs sarcastically] Yeah, innocent."
2,19,DEAN:,"You from Texas all of a sudden? Just because these people are in jail, doesn't mean they deserve to die. If we don't stop this thing, people are going to continue to die. We do this job wherever it takes us."
2,19,SAM:,"Look, Dean, just be straight with me, all right? You're doing this for Deacon."
2,19,DEAN:,Damn right.
2,19,SAM:,"Well, you barely even know the guy."
2,19,DEAN:,We know he was in the Corps with Dad. We know he saved Dad's life. We know we owe him.
2,19,SAM:,But don't you think he's asking a little much?
2,19,DEAN:,"It doesn't matter. We may not be saints, but we're loyal and we pay our debts. Now, that means something to me, and it ought to you. I'm not thrilled about this either, man, but Deacon asked us to hunt this thing down, and that's exactly what we're going to do."
2,19,DEAN:,"You know, this chicken isn't half bad."
2,19,SAM:,Great.
2,19,SAM:,"Finish mine. All right, so let's go back over this, Dean."
2,19,SAM:,"Spirit suspect number one is Mark Moody, right?"
2,19,DEAN:,"Yeah, psycho killer extraordinaire – Satanism, ritual murderer, died in jail."
2,19,SAM:,You sure it's him?
2,19,DEAN:,Pretty sure.
2,19,SAM:,"Dean, considering our circumstances, I'm gonna need a little bit better than ""pretty sure."""
2,19,DEAN:,"Really pretty sure. Moody died of a heart attack, which is what all the victims in here are dying of. He died in the old cell block, which they closed after he croaked, 30 years ago. They just opened that back up. That's when the killings started."
2,19,SAM:,So you think his spirit was released somehow?
2,19,DEAN:,Mm-hmm.
2,19,SAM:,But what if he was already cremated?
2,19,DEAN:,"I'm guessing there's something in the old block that's keeping him around. And whatever it is, we got to find it. And, uh, you know the rest. [DEAN puts down his fork.] I'm done."
2,19,SAM:,Sorry. I –
2,19,TATTOOED PRISONER:,Watch where you're going.
2,19,SAM:,Yeah. Sure. I just –
2,19,DEAN:,He said he was sorry.
2,19,SAM:,Dean...
2,19,TATTOOED PRISONER:,You talking to me? [DEAN stares at him.] Are you talking to me?
2,19,DEAN:,"Great, another guy who's seen ""Taxi Driver"" too many times. Yeah, I'm talking to you. Trust me. Let it go."
2,19,SAM:,"Dean, come on."
2,19,DEAN:,"See, that's how you got to talk to these guys. [DEAN winks.] Instant respect."
2,19,SAM:,You were saying?
2,19,DEAN:,"Oh, great."
2,19,DEAN:,"We can end this right now – no harm, no foul."
2,19,WARDEN:,That's enough!
2,19,WARDEN:,"On your feet, Lucas."
2,19,LUCAS:,"Yes, sir, boss."
2,19,WARDEN:,What's your name?
2,19,DEAN:,Winchester.
2,19,WARDEN:,"Well, Winchester ... not a good start. (Long pause.) Solitary. You too, Lucas."
2,19,LUCAS:,"Yes, sir."
2,19,DEAN:,"[to Sam, over the shoulder of the guard holding him and escorting him out] Are we having fun yet, huh?"
2,19,DEAN:,I wish I had a baseball.
2,19,LUCAS:,What? What'd you say?
2,19,DEAN:,"I said, ""I wish I had a baseball."""
2,19,DEAN:,"You know, like ... Steve McQueen."
2,19,LUCAS:,"Yeah? Well, I wish I had a bat -- so I could bash your frickin’ head in."
2,19,DEAN:,Okay.
2,19,DEAN:,"Well, so much for the bonding in solitary moment."
2,19,DEAN:,"Oh, crap."
2,19,DEAN:,"Lucas, listen to me.  Stay very still."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,Henriksen.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"Hey, Daniels."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,Can I have a word?
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,Have a seat. What's on your mind?
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,"I've been going through the Winchester charges. And I gotta say, there are some weird inconsistencies."
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,Welcome to my world.
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,I talked to a cop in Baltimore who swears up and down these boys saved her life and helped her catch a killer. And there's a witness to your bank robbery in Milwaukee. She swears Sam and Dean saved her life.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,Saved her from what?
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,She was a little unclear on that.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"That's because she's nuts. Look, I was in Milwaukee. I spoke to her, I spoke to all the witnesses."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,And?
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"And, all I know is, wherever these guys go, people die. It's that simple."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,I don't know that it is. They just don't seem cut-and-dry guilty to me. I think there's more to this.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,Like what?
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,I don't know. Can't put my finger on it. It's just... strange.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"Strange.  Yeah.  Okay.  Grownups are trying to get some work done here, so... if you don't mind..."
2,19,SAM:,How you doing?
2,19,PRISONER:,"I'm 54 years old, mopping the floor of a crapper with bars on the windows. How you think I'm doing?"
2,19,SAM:,All right. Bad icebreaker. I'm Sam.
2,19,PRISONER:,Randall.
2,19,SAM:,"Nice to meet y–  Randall.  Hey, weren't you there the night that guard died?"
2,19,RANDALL:,Yeah.
2,19,SAM:,"Well, what happened?"
2,19,RANDALL:,They say the stress of the job got him.
2,19,SAM:,Yeah? What do you say?
2,19,RANDALL:,"Why are you inside, kid?"
2,19,SAM:,'Cause I got an idiot for a brother.
2,19,RANDALL:,That'll do it.
2,19,SAM:,Yeah.
2,19,RANDALL:,"Well, this place ain't so bad. Compared to the old cellblock, this is the damn Hilton."
2,19,SAM:,You spent time in the old block?
2,19,RANDALL:,"Oh, yeah, I was a regular customer."
2,19,SAM:,Didn't they have Mark Moody over there for a while?
2,19,RANDALL:,"He was there. Yeah I was there, too, the night that lunatic bought it."
2,19,SAM:,"Yeah? It was a heart attack, right?"
2,19,RANDALL:,"Sure, his heart stopped right after the guard stopped using his head for batting practice. The next morning, I was in his cell, mopping up the blood. What a mess."
2,19,SAM:,Wait. So he – he was beaten and – and nobody reported it?
2,19,RANDALL:,"You kept your mouth shut, unless you wanted to die from the same heart attack, you know?"
2,19,SAM:,"Randall, exactly how much blood was there?"
2,19,DEAN:,Call.
2,19,PRISONER :,Three aces.
2,19,DEAN:,That's a bad beat. That is a bad beat...
2,19,DEAN:,"...but, see, I'm full... 3s over aces."
2,19,DEAN:,"[laughs and spreads his hands] Ha ha ha, sorry. Hey, it's a cruel game, my friend."
2,19,DEAN:,"Sorry, guys."
2,19,DEAN:,It's like picking low hanging fruit.
2,19,SAM:,You don't even smoke.
2,19,DEAN:,Are you kidding me? This is the currency of the realm.
2,19,DEAN:,Me too. His spirit paid a little visit last night.
2,19,SAM:,What?
2,19,DEAN:,"The clock stopped, the flickering lights, cold spot... I mean, he did everything but yell boo."
2,19,SAM:,"Well, what happened?"
2,19,DEAN:,"He walked right by me. Lucas wasn't so lucky. I mean, the way he was screaming... The guy was a jerk, but he didn't deserve to go like that. What'd you find out on Moody?"
2,19,SAM:,"Yeah, so, I think I know where we might find his remains. Blood in his old cell."
2,19,DEAN:,Blood? I thought it was a heart attack.
2,19,SAM:,"It was, after the guards worked him over. I mean, apparently there was so much blood in there, they had trouble mopping it out."
2,19,DEAN:,How we gonna get in?
2,19,SAM:,I got a plan.
2,19,DEAN:,"[smiling] That's the Sammy I know. Come on, man, you're like Clint Eastwood from ""Escape From Alcatraz."""
2,19,SAM:,"The problem is, if even if we do find something, how are we gonna burn it? We don't have any accelerant."
2,19,DEAN:,"It’s a good thing I'm like James Garner from ""The Great Escape."""
2,19,DEAN:,"Hey, fellas! Who's ready to deal?"
2,19,DEAN:,You sure about this?
2,19,SAM:,Pretty sure.
2,19,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, considering our circumstances, I'd like a little better than ""pretty sure."""
2,19,SAM:,"Okay, really pretty sure."
2,19,DEAN:,I'd like mine al dente.
2,19,DEAN:,Perfect.
2,19,DEAN:,"Save room for dessert, Tiny. Heh heh heh."
2,19,DEAN:,"Hey, I wanted to ask you, 'cause I couldn't help but notice that you are two tons of fun. Just curious – is it like a thyroid problem, or is it some deep seated self-esteem issue?"
2,19,DEAN:,"'Cause, you know, they're, uh they're just doughnuts. They're not love."
2,19,WARDEN:,"Guys, give me a hand."
2,19,WARDEN:,"If we'd waited any longer, you'd be dead."
2,19,DEAN:,You waited long enough.
2,19,WARDEN:,Do yourself a favor. Don't. Talk. [to the guards] Take them both up to the infirmary.
2,19,DEAN:,"Hey, Tiny."
2,19,TINY:,Yeah?
2,19,DEAN:,"Hey, sorry about the things I was saying earlier. I can't really tell you why, but I had to get you angry. So, uh... Anyway, sorry."
2,19,TINY:,"It's okay. Truth is, I have low self-esteem issues. My old man treated me and my brother like crap, right up till the day he died."
2,19,DEAN:,How'd he die?
2,19,TINY:,My brother shot him.
2,19,DEAN:,Okay.
2,19,DEAN:,"Oh, crap."
2,19,TINY:,What is it?
2,19,TINY:,What’s going on?
2,19,TINY:,What is it?
2,19,TINY:,Oh! No! Noooo!  (Screams inarticulately)
2,19,DEAN:,Tiny!
2,19,DEAN:,Tiny!
2,19,DEAN:,[shouting] Guard! Guard!
2,19,SAM:,Wait. So you're telling me it wasn't Moody?
2,19,DEAN:,"Not unless he liked going around dressed like a nurse. Poor Tiny, man. Poor giant Tiny."
2,19,SAM:,"Wait, so this is – this is, like the ghost of some nurse who worked here or something?"
2,19,DEAN:,"I don't know, man. I guess."
2,19,SAM:,"You know what, Dean, at this point, ""I don't know"" isn't working for me. See, uh, I thought we were done. I called Deacon. It's happening. We're getting out tonight."
2,19,DEAN:,"I guess we got to do some quick research, then."
2,19,SAM:,"How? I mean, maybe you haven't noticed ... we're in jail."
2,19,RANDALL:,So you want to know about some nurse?
2,19,RANDALL:,Why you want to know?
2,19,DEAN:,"Well, we got our reasons. But, uh ... we'll make it worth your while."
2,19,DEAN:,"So, this nurse, she would have had white hair, one screwed up eye – is that ringing a bell?"
2,19,RANDALL:,"Yeah. Yeah, I remember her."
2,19,DEAN:,You remember her name?
2,19,RANDALL:,"No, that's still kind of fuzzy."
2,19,SAM:,Give it to him.
2,19,DEAN:,I earned these.
2,19,RANDALL:,Glockner. Nurse Glockner. Nasty old bitch worked here in the '70s.
2,19,SAM:,You knew her?
2,19,RANDALL:,I met her once. Had to get a tetanus shot. She damn near jabbed the needle through the other side of my arm. At least I got out of there alive.
2,19,SAM:,What do you mean?
2,19,RANDALL:,"I've heard these stories. I don't know if they were true. Cons love to talk, but we're all liars."
2,19,DEAN:,What kind of stories?
2,19,RANDALL:,"Guys would go up to the infirmary with a cold. Next thing you know, they're in a body bag. A whole rash of heart attacks – young guys, old guys."
2,19,SAM:,Heart attacks?
2,19,RANDALL:,"Yeah. Story was Glockner had it out for cons and she did this, uh, Charles Bronson thing with a hypodermic. Anyway, that was the rumor. Nobody ever proved anything."
2,19,DEAN:,Whatever happened to Glockner?
2,19,RANDALL:,"I don't know. I finished my bit and left. Next time I landed back in here, she was gone."
2,19,SAM:,"Okay, so let's say those stories on Glockner were true."
2,19,DEAN:,"It's a thought. You know, in life, she's a vigilante. In death, same thing."
2,19,SAM:,"Right. But then how's she tied in with the old cellblock? And if she's going after cons, why kill that one guard?"
2,19,DEAN:,"I did hear in the yard that that guard wasn't exactly squeaky clean, so, maybe she's going after anybody that breaks a law. Like me."
2,19,SAM:,You 'heard in the yard'?
2,19,DEAN:,Yeah.
2,19,SAM:,"Dean, does it ... bother you at all, how easily you seem to fit in here?"
2,19,DEAN:,"No, not really."
2,19,SAM:,"All right. Well, listen, either way, we need more info on Glockner. If -- if she's buried.  If so, where? And, we got five hours to get it. No, no. Don't give me that look.  Don't give me that ""we got to see this thing through"" look. We are leaving tonight, no matter what."
2,19,DEAN:,"I just don't want to let Deacon down, that's all. We do owe him."
2,19,SAM:,"Yeah, but we don't owe him our lives, Dean."
2,19,SAM:,Where you going?
2,19,DEAN:,I'm gonna go talk with our lawyer.
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,You want me to what?
2,19,DEAN:,"Her name was Glockner. She worked here as a nurse in the '70s. Now, I need you to find out everything you can about her, but, most importantly how she died and where she's buried."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,Are you nuts? Do you have any idea the kind of trouble you're in here?
2,19,DEAN:,I have a vague notion.
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,Good. So let's forget about some random nurse and talk about your case.
2,19,DEAN:,"Mara – it's Mara, right?"
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,Yeah.
2,19,DEAN:,"I get that you're trying to help me, okay? I do, but believe me when I say that this is the best way that you can help."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,Really? How? Explain that to me.
2,19,DEAN:,"I wish I could, but I can't. I'm just gonna have to ask you to trust me on this."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,Why should I? Henriksen says you're a monster.
2,19,DEAN:,"I'm a monster? I’m – [laughs] Well, he's wrong, okay? I'm not what they say I am."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,Everybody says that.
2,19,DEAN:,"Yeah. Look, if you're as smart a P.D. as I think you are, then you can tell with just one look whether or not your clients are guilty, okay, just like that. So I want you to look at me, really look, and you tell me – am I guilty? (pause) We're not the bad guys."
2,19,SAM:,She go for it?
2,19,DEAN:,"No. No, not so much. But, uh, maybe she'll still come around."
2,19,SAM:,"Well, we can't wait around to find out."
2,19,DEAN:,We could give it another day.
2,19,SAM:,"No, no, no. We're leaving tonight, and that's it."
2,19,DEAN:,"So we're not gonna finish the job, we're just gonna let these people die?"
2,19,SAM:,"Don't give me that, all right? This was your stupid plan. I went along with it, but we're sticking to the plan, Dean."
2,19,DEAN:,"Okay. Uh, you leave. I'm gonna stay."
2,19,SAM:,"Hey, don't turn away. Don't turn away from me!"
2,19,DEAN:,Screw you.
2,19,SAM:,What?! Screw you!
2,19,WARDEN:,"All right, hard case. I see the usual methods ain't gonna work with you. [to SAM] You too, sweetheart."
2,19,WARDEN:,[to guard] Take off. I want to handle this alone.
2,19,DEAN:,"Deacon, you are beating the holy hell out of me, man."
2,19,DEACON:,"Sorry, Dean. I thought I was going easy on you. [DEAN laughs.]  Just, uh, trying to make it look real."
2,19,DEAN:,"Yeah. Well, mission accomplished."
2,19,SAM:,Thanks.
2,19,DEACON:,"So, is it over?"
2,19,SAM:,"No. Turns out, it wasn't Moody."
2,19,DEACON:,What?
2,19,SAM:,Yeah.
2,19,DEACON:,Then who?
2,19,SAM:,"Uh, we think it's some nurse who used to work here, but we're still shy on all the intel we need."
2,19,DEAN:,Which is why we should stick around until we find it.
2,19,DEACON:,"Oh, hey guys."
2,19,SAM:,"You want to have this fight for real, Dean? We gotta go."
2,19,DEAN:,I’m just say–
2,19,SAM:,We gotta go now!
2,19,DEACON:,Guys.
2,19,SAM:,"We're leaving, Dean. Otherwise, we'll be leaving in shackles for Milwaukee, with Henriksen as company."
2,19,DEAN:,"Oh, come on."
2,19,DEACON:,Guys!
2,19,DEACON:,Your lawyer left this for you.
2,19,DEAN:,"Heh heh.  Would you look at that. Man, I am freaking velvety smooth."
2,19,SAM:,"You want to, maybe, open it up after, you know, you're done patting yourself on the back?  (DEACON is watching SAM, smiling.)"
2,19,DEAN:,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2,19,DEAN:,Wow.
2,19,SAM:,"What? You want to share with the class, Dean?"
2,19,DEAN:,Glockner died in the old cellblock after Moody bit it. Seems they had a little inmate uprising. She got caught in the middle. They dragged her to a solitary cell and gave her a severe cerebral edema.
2,19,SAM:,Someone bashed her head in.
2,19,DEAN:,Yeah.
2,19,SAM:,Does it say where she's buried?
2,19,DEAN:,Yep.
2,19,DEACON:,"All right, then, let's get you the hell out of here."
2,19,DEAN:,"Don't worry, Deacon. We'll get rid of this thing."
2,19,DEACON:,"Good, 'cause I want it out of my prison."
2,19,DEACON:,"Boys, uh... I can't thank you enough for this. I know it was asking a lot but you still came through. Your daddy ... raised you right."
2,19,SAM:,"Well, we owed you."
2,19,DEACON:,Yeah.
2,19,DEACON:,"Hope to see you again, huh? Just  ... not in here, okay?"
2,19,SAM:,"Yeah, we'll do our best."
2,19,DEAN:,Oh... Where do you want it?
2,19,DEACON:,What?
2,19,DEACON:,"Yeah, um..."
2,19,DEACON:,"Um... Make it look real, son."
2,19,DEAN:,"You know, I almost wish I could see Henriksen's face."
2,19,SAM (tightly):,"Really? 'Cause I'd be happy if I never saw him again. I mean, we're not really out of the woods yet, Dean, you know?"
2,19,DEAN:,Yeah.
2,19,DEAN:,Good point.
2,19,DEACON:,I told you. One of them came up behind me.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,You let them get the drop on you.
2,19,DEACON:,"Yeah. I screwed up, all right? What do you want me to say?"
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,I want to know where they're headed.
2,19,DEACON:,How the hell would I know?
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,Let's start over again.
2,19,DEACON:,For God's sake.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"Again. I want to know everything they did today, from the minute they woke up."
2,19,DEACON:,Got up. Breakfast. Visiting hours. Rec time.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,Any visitors?
2,19,DEACON:,Just their lawyer.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,It's an easy question. What did you and Dean talk about?
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,I have already told you. It was a private conversation between me and my client.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"Right, and just three hours later he just happened to bust out. Now, tell me, what he said."
2,19,SAM:,We got to move it. If Henriksen gets to the lawyer...
2,19,DEAN:,"I thought she couldn't say anything – you know, that whole lawyer-client privilege thing."
2,19,SAM:,"The privilege doesn't apply, Dean."
2,19,DEAN:,So she'll talk?
2,19,SAM:,She has to.
2,19,DEAN:,"Oh, that's freaking super."
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"Let me make this simple. You don't come clean, I will put you on the hook for aiding and abetting."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,"Oh, that – that is ridiculous."
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,"You don't think that I can? You think this is some kind of game, lady? I am the last person on planet earth you want to screw with. Now, tell me what he said."
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,[sighs] He wanted me to do some research. On a prison nurse that died in 1976.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,What? Why?
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,I don't know.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,What else?
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,They wanted to know where she was buried.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,Did you find out where?
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,Yeah.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,Did you tell them?
2,19,MARA DANIELS:,Yeah.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,Tell me.
2,19,SAM:,Got her.
2,19,GHOST:,You let those two go.
2,19,HENRIKSEN:,Are you sure this is the right damn cemetery?
2,19,REIDY:,She said Mountainside.  Mountainside Cemetery.
2,19,SAM:,You thought we were screwed before?
2,19,DEAN:,"Yeah, I know. We got to go deep this time."
2,19,SAM:,"""Deep,"" Dean? We should go to Yemen."
2,19,DEAN:,"Ooh, I'm – I'm not sure I'm ready to go that deep."
2,20,MARY,Good night love.
2,20,JOHN,Hey Dean.
2,20,JOHN,Hey buddy.
2,20,SAM,"Dean, this is my girlfriend, Jessica."
2,20,JESSICA,So here's to Sam and his awesome LSAT victory.
2,20,SAM,What would I do without you?
2,20,JESSICA,Crash and burn.
2,20,SAM,I'm not going to just ditch the job!
2,20,DEAN,"Screw the job, man.  I'm sick of the job anyway.  I mean, we don't get paid.  We don't get thanked.  Only thing we get's bad luck."

2,21,ANDY,Sam! What are you doing here?
2,21,SAM,I don’t know.
2,21,ANDY,What am I doing here?!
2,21,SAM,I don’t know.
2,21,ANDY,Where are we?!
2,21,SAM,"Andy, look, calm down."
2,21,ANDY,I can’t calm down! I just woke up in freaking Frontierland!
2,21,SAM,What’s the last thing you remember?
2,21,ANDY,"Honestly? My fourth bong load. It was weird. All of a sudden, there was this really intense smell. Like, uh…"
2,21,SAM,Like sulfur?
2,21,ANDY,How did you know that?
2,21,SAM,[remembering something] Dean.
2,21,ANDY,"Your, your brother – is he here?"
2,21,SAM,I don’t know where he is. I don’t know if he’s…
2,21,SAM,Hello?
2,21,WOMAN,"Help me! Help me, please!"
2,21,SAM,"Okay, I’m here. We’re gonna get you out, all right? Just hold on a second."
2,21,WOMAN,Please!
2,21,SAM,"All right, one second."
2,21,WOMAN,Please!
2,21,SAM,Ava?
2,21,AVA,"Oh my God! Sam! [Sobbing, she gives him a gigantic hug.]"
2,21,ANDY,"So, I guess you guys know each other."
2,21,SAM,Yeah.
2,21,AVA,"How did you—I mean, how did you—"
2,21,SAM,"Ava, have you been here this whole time?"
2,21,AVA,"What whole time? I just woke up in there, like, a half an hour ago."
2,21,SAM,"Well, you’ve been gone for five months. My brother and I have been looking for you everywhere."
2,21,AVA,"Okay, that’s impossible, because I saw you two days ago."
2,21,SAM,You didn’t. I’m sorry.
2,21,AVA,"But… that makes no sense. That’s not—oh my God! My fiancée, Brady! If I’ve been missing for that long, he must be freaking out!"
2,21,SAM,Well…
2,21,AVA,Oh!
2,21,ANDY,Hey. Andy. Also freaking out.
2,21,AVA,Okay. [to Sam] What’s happening?
2,21,MAN,Hello? Is anybody there?
2,21,SAM,Maybe more than three.
2,21,SAM,"Hello?  Hey!  Hey, you guys all right?"
2,21,JAKE,I think so.
2,21,SAM,I’m Sam.
2,21,JAKE,I’m Jake.
2,21,LILY,Lily.
2,21,SAM,Are there any more of you?
2,21,JAKE,Naw.
2,21,LILY,"How did we even get here? A minute ago, I was in San Diego."
2,21,JAKE,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I went to sleep last night in Afghanistan."
2,21,JAKE,What?
2,21,SAM,It started a little over a year ago? You found you could do things? Things you didn’t think were possible? [They both nod.] I have visions. I see things before they happen.
2,21,AVA,"Yeah. Me, too."
2,21,ANDY,Uh…okay.
2,21,LILY,"So, you go, “Simon says give me your wallet”, and they do? [to Sam] You have visions? That’s great! I’d kill for something like that."
2,21,SAM,"Lily, listen, it’s okay—"
2,21,LILY,"No. It’s not. I touch people? Their hearts stop. I can barely leave my house. My life’s not exactly improved. So, screw you. I just wanna go home."
2,21,JAKE,"And what, we don’t?"
2,21,LILY,"You know what, don’t talk to me like that, not right—"
2,21,SAM,"Hey, guys, please. Look, whether we like it or not, we’re all here, and so we all have to deal with this."
2,21,ANDY,Who brought us here?
2,21,SAM,It’s less of a “who”. It’s ... more of a “what”.
2,21,AVA,What does that mean?
2,21,SAM,[after a pause] It’s a ... (huh) it's a demon.
2,21,BOBBY,This is it. All demonic signs and omens over the past month.
2,21,DEAN,Are you joking? There’s nothing here.
2,21,BOBBY,Exactly.
2,21,DEAN,"Well, come on, there’s gotta be something. What about the, the, the normal, low-level stuff? You know, exorcisms, that kind of thing."
2,21,DEAN,"Well, how are we supposed to look for Sam? What, do we just close our eyes and point?"
2,21,DEAN,"Ash, what do you got?"
2,21,ASH,"Okay, listen, it’s a big negatory on Sam—"
2,21,DEAN,"Oh, come on, man! You’ve gotta give us something. We’re looking at a three thousand-mile haystack here."
2,21,ASH,"Listen, Dean. I did find something."
2,21,DEAN,"Well, what?"
2,21,ASH,"I can’t talk over this line, Dean."
2,21,DEAN,"Come on, I don’t have time for this!"
2,21,DEAN,I guess we’re going to the Roadhouse. Come on.
2,21,[CUT TO,UNKNOWN LOCATION.]
2,21,JAKE,"So, we’re soldiers in a demon war to bring on the Apocalypse?"
2,21,SAM,When you put it like that—
2,21,JAKE,"And, and we’ve been picked?"
2,21,SAM,Yes.
2,21,JAKE,Why us?
2,21,SAM,"I’m not sure, okay? But look, I just know—"
2,21,AVA,"Sam, I’m sorry. Psychics and spoon-bending is one thing, but demons?"
2,21,SAM,"Look, I know it sounds crazy, but—"
2,21,JAKE,It doesn’t just sound it.
2,21,SAM,"I don’t really care what you think, okay? If we’re all gathered here together, then that means it’s starting and that we’ve gotta—"
2,21,JAKE,"The only thing I’ve gotta do is stay away from wackjobs, okay? I’ve heard enough. I’m better off on my own. FYI, so are you."
2,21,SAM,"Jake, hold on. Jake!"
2,21,JAKE,Hello? [The girl can be heard giggling somewhere in the room.] It’s all right. Don’t be scared. Are you lost? [No response] Hello?
2,21,JAKE,Get back!
2,21,SAM,Just so you know? That was a demon.
2,21,SAM,"Now, that thing – I’m not sure, but I think it was an Acheri. A demon that disguises itself as a little girl. That still doesn’t tell us where we are. Andy, are you with me or what?"
2,21,ANDY,"[stunned] Give me a minute. I’m still working through, “Demons are real”."
2,21,AVA,Swell. Good to know we’re somewhere so historical.
2,21,LILY,Why in the world would that demon or whatever put us here?
2,21,SAM,I’m wondering the same thing.
2,21,LILY,"You know what? It doesn’t matter. Clearly, the only sane thing to do here is get the hell out of Dodge."
2,21,SAM,"Wait, hold on. Lily, the only way out is through miles of woods."
2,21,LILY,Beats hanging out with demons.
2,21,SAM,"Lily, look, we don’t know what’s going on yet. I mean, we don’t even know how many of them are out there right now."
2,21,JAKE,"Yeah, he’s right. We should—"
2,21,LILY,Don’t say “we”! I’m not part of “we”. I have nothing in common with any of you.
2,21,SAM,"Okay, look, I know—"
2,21,LILY,You don’t know anything! [pause] I accidentally touched my girlfriend.
2,21,SAM,I’m sorry.
2,21,LILY,"Whatever. I feel like I’m in a nightmare, and it just keeps getting worse and worse."
2,21,SAM,"I’ve lost people, too. I have a brother out there right now that could be dead, for all I know. We’re all in bad shape. But I’m telling you, the best way out of this is to stick together."
2,21,LILY,Fine.
2,21,SAM,"We’re looking for iron, silver, salt –- any kind of weapon."
2,21,JAKE,Salt is a weapon?
2,21,SAM,It’s a brave new world.
2,21,ANDY,"Well, hopefully there’s food in your world, because I’m frickin’ starving."

2,21,SAM,Are you sure it’s not some kind of—
2,21,AVA,"What? Some kind of freaky vision thing? No, more like I’d kill for a sandwich. I haven’t eaten since…well, who knows? No, don’t worry. I’m fine. Except for every single thing that’s happening."
2,21,ANDY,[OS] You guys! I found something!

2,21,AVA,"Oh, my God! Okay, that’s officially—Sam, she’s dead! She’s dead! You said we were chosen for a reason. That is not chosen! That’s killed! Okay, we have to get out of here."
2,21,SAM,Stop.
2,21,ANDY,"Yeah, I second that emotion."
2,21,JAKE,Not sure that’s an option.
2,21,AVA,What?
2,21,SAM,Lily was trying to leave. The demon’s not gonna let us get away that easy. We’ve gotta gear up for the next attack.
2,21,AVA,"Oh, gear up?"
2,21,SAM,Yeah.
2,21,AVA,"Okay, well, I’m not a soldier. I can’t do that!"
2,21,SAM,"Well, if you wanna stay alive, you’re gonna have to. Let’s go."
2,21,JAKE,I’ll get her down.
2,21,SAM,"You know, I was just thinking about how much Dean would help right now. I’d give my arm for a working phone."
2,21,ANDY,"[realizing something] You know, you may not need one. I’ve never tried it long-distance before, but do you have anything of Dean’s on you? Like, something he touched?"
2,21,SAM,Uh…I’ve got a receipt. Would that work?
2,21,ANDY,Yeah. [He looks at the signature on the receipt.] D. Hasselhoff?
2,21,SAM,"Yeah, that’s Dean’s signature. [beat] It’s hard to explain."
2,21,ANDY,All right.
2,21,[CUT TO,ROADHOUSE.]
2,21,BOBBY,This is… [trails off]
2,21,DEAN,"What the hell did Ash know? We’ve got no way of knowing where Ellen is. Or if she’s even alive. We’ve got no clue what Ash was gonna tell us. Now, how the hell are we gonna find Sam?"
2,21,BOBBY,We’ll find him.
2,21,BOBBY,Dean?
2,21,BOBBY,What was that?
2,21,DEAN,I don’t know. A headache?
2,21,BOBBY,You get headaches like that a lot?
2,21,DEAN,No. Must be the stress. [chuckles] I could have sworn I saw something.
2,21,BOBBY,What do you mean? Like a vision? Like what Sam gets?
2,21,DEAN,What? No!
2,21,BOBBY,I’m just saying.
2,21,DEAN,"Come on, I’m not some psychic."
2,21,BOBBY,Dean? Dean! Are you with me?
2,21,DEAN,"Yeah, I think so. I saw Sam. I saw him, Bobby."
2,21,BOBBY,It was a vision.
2,21,DEAN,"Yeah. I don’t know how, but yeah. Whew. That was about as fun as getting kicked in the jewels."
2,21,BOBBY,What else did you see?
2,21,DEAN,Uh… there was a bell.
2,21,BOBBY,What kind of bell?
2,21,DEAN,"Like a big bell with some kind of engraving on it, I don’t know."
2,21,BOBBY,Engraving?
2,21,DEAN,Yeah.
2,21,BOBBY,"Was it a tree? Like, an oak tree?"
2,21,DEAN,"Yeah, exactly."
2,21,BOBBY,I know where Sam is.
2,21,[CUT TO,"COLD OAK, SOUTH DAKOTA. NIGHT. JAKE and SAM are in a barn, trying to break some of the iron bars off one of the machines. JAKE, however, grabs one of the bars and rips it off with his bare hands. SAM stares at him, stunned.]"
2,21,JAKE,I’m not Superman or anything. It’s no big deal.
2,21,SAM,You were in Afghanistan when this started?
2,21,JAKE,"Yeah, I started getting headaches. And then there was this accident. This guy flipped his vehicle on a bad road. He got pinned underneath. I lifted it off him like it was nothing. Everybody said it was a fluke adrenaline thing."
2,21,SAM,"But then you did it again, right?"
2,21,JAKE,"Bench-pressed 800 pounds, stone-cold calm. I never told anybody, of course. It was just too crazy."
2,21,SAM,Yeah. Crazy’s relative.
2,21,JAKE,I’m starting to get that.
2,21,SAM,Yeah.
2,21,JAKE,"By the way, I appreciate what you’re doing here."
2,21,SAM,What am I doing?
2,21,JAKE,Keeping calm. Keeping them calm. Especially considering how freaked to hell you really are. I’ve been in some deep crap before myself. I know the look.
2,21,SAM,"[after a long pause] You wanna know the truth? I got this brother, right? And he’s always telling me how he’s gonna watch out for me, how everything’s gonna be okay. You know, kind of like I’ve been telling them."
2,21,JAKE,Yeah?
2,21,SAM,"I don’t know if I believe it this time. I mean, the size of what’s coming – it’s bigger than anyone has ever seen. I mean, it’s gonna get bad. And I don’t know if—"
2,21,JAKE,If we’re gonna make it? It doesn’t matter if we believe it. Only matters that they do.
2,21,AVA,My horoscope said I shouldn’t have gotten out of bed. [scoffs] How you doing? Holding up?
2,21,SAM,I’m okay. What about you?
2,21,AVA,"Not so okay. Why us, Sam? What did we do to deserve this?"
2,21,SAM,"Just lucky, I guess."
2,21,AVA,"If it wasn’t for bad luck, we’d have no luck at all. I just can’t wait for this all to be over so I can just pretend it never happened. I just wanna curl up with Brady and watch bad TV. [She notices SAM shift uncomfortably.] What is it? Sam … do you know something that I don’t?"
2,21,SAM,"Look, Ava… I’m sorry. I wish I didn’t have to tell you this."
2,21,AVA,Tell me what?
2,21,SAM,When the demon broke into your house to take you…your fiancée didn’t make it. I’m sorry.
2,21,AVA,"No, that’s…no! [SAM holds her while she sobs.]"
2,21,SAM,Jake! Behind you! [JAKE doesn’t hear him.]
2,21,YED,"Howdy, Sam."
2,21,SAM,I’m dreaming.
2,21,YED,What do you say you and I take a little walk?
2,21,YED,"You’re awfully quiet, Sam. You’re not mad at me, are you?"
2,21,SAM,"I’m gonna tear you to shreds, I swear to—"
2,21,YED,"[chuckles] When you wake up, tiger, you give it your best shot."
2,21,SAM,Where’s my brother?
2,21,YED,Quit worrying about Dean. I’d worry more about yourself.
2,21,SAM,Why? You gonna kill me?
2,21,YED,I’m trying to help you. That’s why we’re talking. You’re the one I’m rooting for.
2,21,SAM,What’s that supposed to mean?
2,21,YED,Welcome to the Miss America pageant. Why do you think you’re here? This is a competition. Only one of you crazy kids is gonna make it out of here alive.
2,21,SAM,I thought we were supposed to be—
2,21,SAM,Why?
2,21,YED,"Well, I couldn’t just come out and say that, could I, Sam? I had to let everyone think they had a fighting chance. But what I need ... is a leader."
2,21,SAM,To lead who?
2,21,YED,"Oh, I’ve already got my army. Or, I will soon, anyway."
2,21,SAM,You son of a bitch.
2,21,YED,"Honestly, I’m surprised you hadn’t guessed. I mean, why do you think so many children flamed out already? Max Miller and Andy’s brother, what’s-his-name?  They weren’t strong enough. I’m looking for the best and brightest of your generation."
2,21,SAM,My generation?
2,21,YED,"Well, there’s other generations, but let’s just worry about yours. That’s why I’m here, Sam. I wanna give you the inside track. You’re tough. You’re smart. You’re well-trained, thanks to your daddy. Sam – Sammy – you’re my favorite."
2,21,SAM,You ruined my life. You killed everyone I love.
2,21,YED,"The cost of doing business, I’m afraid. I mean, sweet little Jessica – she just had to die. You were all set to marry that little blonde thing, become a tax lawyer with two kids, a beer gut, and a little McMansion in the suburbs. I needed you sharp, on the road, honing your skills. Your gifts."
2,21,SAM,What about my mom?
2,21,YED,That was bad luck.
2,21,SAM,Bad luck?
2,21,YED,"She walked in on us. Wrong place, wrong time."
2,21,SAM,What does that mean?
2,21,YED,It wasn’t about her. It was about you. It’s always been about you.
2,21,SAM,What?
2,21,YED,Well…okay. You caught me in a charitable mood. I’ll show you.
2,21,YED,Look familiar? It should.
2,21,PRESENT YED,"Relax, Sam, this is just a hi-def instant replay. Enjoy the show."
2,21,MARY,John?
2,21,SAM,[invisible to her] Mom!
2,21,MARY,Is he hungry?
2,21,PAST YED,Shh.
2,21,MARY,Okay. [leaves]
2,21,SAM,"Wait, Mom. Mom!"
2,21,PRESENT YED,"What did I just tell you, Sam? She can’t hear you. This isn’t real."
2,21,SAM,What the hell are you doing to me?
2,21,PRESENT YED,Better than mother’s milk.
2,21,SAM,Does this mean I have demon blood in me? [The demon chuckles.] Answer me!
2,21,MARY,It’s you.
2,21,SAM,She knew you.
2,21,SAM,No! [MARY continues her slide upward.]  No!
2,21,PRESENT YED,I don’t think you wanna see the rest of this.
2,21,JAKE,"Sam, wake up! Ava’s missing."
2,21,SAM,"All right. Meet back here in ten minutes, okay?"
2,21,JAKE,Okay.
2,21,ANDY,"Ava, where’d you go? Didn’t you hear us yelling?"
2,21,AVA,"Yeah, I heard you."
2,21,ANDY,What are you doing?
2,21,ANDY,Holy…
2,21,AVA,Sam! I just found him like this!
2,21,SAM,What happened?
2,21,AVA,I don’t know!
2,21,SAM,How’d that thing get in? Where were you?
2,21,AVA,"I just went to get some water from the well. I was only gone maybe, like, two minutes!"
2,21,SAM,"You shouldn’t have gone outside. Ava, we have to stay in here— [SAM notices the salt on the window.] Who did that?"
2,21,AVA,"I don’t know, maybe Andy—"
2,21,SAM,"Andy wouldn’t do that. Ava, that line wasn’t broken when I left. Ava."
2,21,AVA,What? You don’t think that I—
2,21,AVA,What are you trying to say?
2,21,SAM,What happened to you?
2,21,AVA,Nothing!
2,21,AVA,"Had you going though, didn’t I? [wiping her eyes] Yeah. I’ve been here a long time. And not alone, either. People just keep showing up. Children, like us. Batches of three or four at a time."
2,21,SAM,You killed them? All of them?
2,21,AVA,I’m the undefeated heavyweight champ.
2,21,SAM,"Oh, my God."
2,21,AVA,"Don’t think God has much to do with this, Sam."
2,21,SAM,How could you?
2,21,AVA,"I had no choice. It's me or them. After a while, it was easy. It was even kind of fun. I just stopped fighting it."
2,21,SAM,Fighting what?
2,21,AVA,"Who we are, Sam. If you'd just quit your hand-wringing and open yourself up, you have no idea what you can do. The learning curve is so fast, it’s crazy, the switches that just flip in your brain. (laughs) I can’t believe I started out just having dreams. Do you know what I can do now?"
2,21,SAM,Control demons.
2,21,AVA,"Ah, you are quick on the draw. [She puts her hands to her head.] Yeah, I’m sorry, Sam. But, it’s over."
2,21,BOBBY,"Well, it looks like the rest of the way’s on foot."
2,21,DEAN,Let’s go.
2,21,SAM,I think we can make it out of here now.
2,21,JAKE,But the Acheri demon…
2,21,SAM,"No, no, no. Ava was summoning it, controlling it. It shouldn’t come back now that she’s dead. We gotta go."
2,21,JAKE,"Not “we”, Sam. Only one of us is getting out of here. I, I’m sorry."
2,21,SAM,What?
2,21,JAKE,"I had a vision. That Yellow-Eyed Demon or whatever it was, he talked to me. He told me how it was."
2,21,SAM,"No, Jake, listen. You can’t listen to him."
2,21,JAKE,"S-Sam, he’s not letting us go. Only one. Now, if we don’t play along, he’ll kill us both. Now, I-I like you, man. I do. But do the math here. What good’s it do for both of us to die? Now, I can get out of here. I get close to the demon, I can kill the bastard."
2,21,SAM,"You come with me, we can kill him together."
2,21,JAKE,How do I know you won’t turn on me?
2,21,SAM,I won’t.
2,21,JAKE,I don’t know that.
2,21,SAM,"Okay, look."
2,21,SAM,"Just come with me, Jake. Don’t do this. Don’t play into what it wants."
2,21,SAM,(sighs in relief) Okay.
2,21,DEAN,Sam!
2,21,SAM,Dean! (in relief and happiness)
2,21,DEAN,"Sam, look out!  (picking up his pace)"
2,21,DEAN,Noooo!
2,21,DEAN,"No, Sam!"
2,21,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sam. Sam! Hey! Hey, hey. Come here. Let me look at you."
2,21,DEAN,"Hey, look at me. It’s not even that bad. It’s not even that bad, all right? Sammy? Sam!  [DEAN is holding SAM, looking at him, and SAM's head is wobbling.]  Hey, listen to me. We’re gonna patch you up, okay? You’ll be good as new. Huh?  I’m gonna take care of you. I’m gonna take care of you. I’ve got you. That’s my job, right? Watch out for my pain-in-the-ass little brother? [DEAN touches his brother's face.]  Sam? Sam! Sam!  Sammy!"
2,21,DEAN,"No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, God.  Oh, God."
2,21,DEAN,SAM!
2,22,JOHN,"Back in 1835, Samuel Colt made a special gun.  They say this gun can kill anything."
2,22,SAM,"The Colt is gone, and it seems pretty damn likely that the demon is behind all of this."
2,22,DEAN,Whoops.
2,22,DEAN,"Crossroads are where pacts are made.  In selling your soul, ritual like this, you gotta put your own photo into the mix, right?"
2,22,CROSSROADS DEMON,"I know all about you, Dean Winchester."
2,22,YED,I'm looking for the best and brightest.
2,22,SAM,I'm Sam.
2,22,JAKE,I'm Jake.
2,22,YED,This is a competition.  Only one of you crazy kids is gonna make it out of here alive.
2,22,YED,"You're tough, you're smart, you're well-trained.  Sam, you're my favorite."
2,22,DEAN,Sam!
2,22,SAM,Dean!
2,22,DEAN,"Sam, look out!  NOOOO! (running towards SAM as SAM is knifed in the back by JAKE)"
2,22,DEAN,Let me look at you ... (holds SAM while he dies)  ... SAM!
2,22,DEAN (yelling),"Well, then let it end!"
2,22,FADE IN,WOODS. NIGHT
2,22,FADE IN,MOTEL ROOM (dawn or early morning)
2,22,CUT TO,
2,22,CUT TO,
2,22,CUT TO,
3,2,DEAN,All you gotta do is bring Sam back.
3,3,SAM,Did I die? Did you sell your soul for me?  How long'd you get?
3,3,DEAN,One year.
3,3,SAM,What kind of blade can kill a demon?
3,3,BOBBY,Yesterday I'd've said there was no such thing.
3,3,DEAN,Who was that masked chick?
3,3,SAM,You ever run across a guy named Gordon Walker?
3,3,ELLEN,He is dangerous to everyone and everything around him.
3,3,DEAN,"Gordon should be reachin' for the soap, for the next few years, at least."
3,3,RUBY,I'm here because I want to help you.
3,3,SAM,What could you possibly—
3,3,RUBY,I can help you save your brother.
3,3,LATER,
3,4,ANDY,"Father, God's not with us. (beat) Not anymore."
3,4,FATHER GIL,"Andy, of course He is. Why would you say that? What's wrong?"
3,4,ANDY (panting),He can't help us.  And if He can... He won't.
3,4,FATHER GIL,"Andy, wait!"
3,4,SAM,"Might've found some omens in Ohio. Dry lightning, barometric-pressure drop."
3,4,DEAN,"Well, that's thrilling."
3,4,DEAN,Or it could just be a suicide and a psycho scrapbooker.
3,4,SAM,"Yeah, but it's our best lead since Lincoln."
3,4,DEAN,Where in Ohio?
3,4,SAM,Elizabethville. It's a half-dead factory town in the rust belt.
3,4,DEAN,There's got to be a demon or two in South Beach.
3,4,BOBBY,Slow.
3,4,DEAN,"Eh, I tell you, it's a little sad seeing the Colt like that."
3,4,BOBBY,"Well, the only thing it's good for now is figuring out what makes it tick."
3,4,SAM,So what makes it tick?
3,4,DEAN,"(smiles) All right, come on, we're wasting the daylight."
3,4,SAM,"See you, Bobby."
3,4,BOBBY,Hey! You boys run into anything — anything — you call me.
3,4,FATHER GIL,There's not much left for the insurance company. It was a suicide - I saw it myself.
3,4,DEAN,"Well,this shouldn't take long, then."
3,4,SAM,When did he stop?
3,4,FATHER GIL,Probably about ... two months ago?  Right around the time everything else started to change.
3,4,SAM,Change how?
3,4,FATHER GIL,"Oh, let's just say this used to be a town ... you could be proud of. People ... cared about each other.  Andy sang in the choir, and then one day, he just ... wasn't Andy anymore. It was like he was ..."
3,4,SAM,Possessed?
3,4,FATHER GIL,"You could say that. Gambled away his money, cheated on his wife, destroyed his business. Yes, like a switch had flipped."
3,4,SAM,"Father, did you know the man who killed those folks in the hobby shop?"
3,4,FATHER GIL,"Sure, Tony Perkins."
3,4,SAM,Tony Perkins.
3,4,FATHER GIL,Good man.
3,4,SAM,"Would you say that his personality suddenly changed one day, too?"
3,4,FATHER GIL,"I never thought about it that way, but... yes. about the same time as Andy — about two months ago."
3,4,DEAN,Richie.  (The other guy looks up.)  I don't believe it.
3,4,RICHIE,"Hey, Dean... Winchester, right?"
3,4,DEAN,Yeah.
3,4,RICHIE,"This is my sister, uh, Cheryl."
3,4,CHERYL,Hey.
3,4,DEAN,Cheryl.
3,4,DEAN,"Come on in. This is my brother, Sam."
3,4,RICHIE,Hey. How you doing?
3,4,SAM,Not too bad. How do you two know each other?
3,4,DEAN,You were in school.
3,4,RICHIE,"It was that succubus, in Canarsie right?"
3,4,DEAN,"Yeah, yeah."
3,4,RICHIE,"Oh, man. You should have seen the rack on this broad. Freakin' tragedy when I had to gank her."
3,4,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa. Wait. Who killed her? If I remember, your ass was toast until I showed up."
3,4,RICHIE,"Oh, I forgot what a comedian this guy was."
3,4,DEAN,"Richie, Richie, know what?  I told you then and I'll tell you again — you're not cut out for this job. You're gonna get yourself killed."
3,4,DEAN,"So you find anything in this town, anyway?"
3,4,DEAN,Yeah.
3,4,RICHIE,"No, I got nothing."
3,4,DEAN,Typical. What about your sister back there?
3,4,SAM,"Yeah, that's where we are, too. You know, let's just say that demons are possessing people in this town.  You know, raising hell—"
3,4,DEAN,"Yeah, but why would a demon blow his brains out?"
3,4,RICHIE,"Well, for fun? You know he wrecks one body, moves to another. You know, like taking a stolen car for a joyride."
3,4,DEAN,"Anybody else left in the town that fits the profile — you know, nice guy turned douche, still breathing?"
3,4,RICHIE,There's Trotter.
3,4,SAM,Who's that?
3,4,RICHIE,"Well, he used to be head of the Rotary Club. And then people say he turned bastard all of a sudden?  Brought in the gambling, the hookers. ... Ah, he practically owns this whole town."
3,4,SAM,Know where we could find him?
3,4,RICHIE,"Oh, he'll be at his bar in a few hours."
3,4,MUSIC,"Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Run Through the Jungle""."
3,4,MUSIC,"Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Run Through the Jungle"" continues playing as SAM and DEAN pull up in the IMPALA. The town in buzzing, it looks like Mardi Gras — people wandering around with cocktails, sexy girls, lots of action."
3,4,SAM,"It is. At least, it's supposed to be."
3,4,DEAN,"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's do some research.  (DEAN looks excited to follow a bunch of attractive women.  From a car, a woman in a miniskirt watches him, then gestures for him to come.  DEAN approaches the car and looks at her, smiling; SAM comes back to fetch DEAN and smiles embarrassedly at the woman as he pulls DEAN away."
3,4,MUSIC,"CCR continues to play as SAM and DEAN thread their way through a crowded bar.  People are drinking and dancing and seem to be having a good time.  DEAN is at ease, moving through the crowd like he's trying to pick out the best action.  SAM is getting bumped into and seems to feel a little awkward and overstimulated."
3,4,DEAN,"Oh, Richie. Look at you."
3,4,RICHIE,Hey.
3,4,DEAN,Bringing satin back.
3,4,SAM,"How much is ""forget about it""?"
3,4,RICHIE,"Ah, forget about it. That's Trotter over there. He sits there all night. Can't touch him."
3,4,SAM,"So,what do we do now?"
3,4,DEAN,"I don't know about you guys, but I'm gonna do a little investigating with that bartender."
3,4,RICHIE,"Easy. Me and her, we got a little ... somethin'-somethin' lined up for later."
3,4,DEAN,"Yeah, right."
3,4,RICHIE,"Stings, don't it? All right. I got to hit the head, release the hostages. Be back in a few."
3,4,DEAN,"No way he gets a girl like that. I mean, look at her. You could fit that ass on a nickel."
3,4,FATHER GIL,You think so?
3,4,DEAN,"Oh. (laughs) Sorry, Padre."
3,4,FATHER GIL,Knew you boys would find your way here. They all do.
3,4,SAM,"No offense, but what are you doing here, Father?"
3,4,FATHER GIL,"Like it or not, you go where your flock is."
3,4,CASEY,"Plus, the clergy drinks for free."
3,4,FATHER GIL,"True, and a certain bartender owes me a confession."
3,4,CASY,"Not in this lifetime, Father."
3,4,CASEY,What can I get you boys?
3,4,DEAN,What's your speciality?
3,4,CASEY,I make a mean hurricane.
3,4,DEAN,I guess we'll see about that.
3,4,DEAN,I do now.
3,4,JOHN,Reggie. Everything okay with you?
3,4,REGGIE,I don't know. I'm just not feeling myself today.
3,4,(JOHN,"Hey, what are you doing?!)"
3,4,SAM,Somebody call 911!
3,4,SAM,Too many cops here. I say we roll.
3,4,DEAN,Just be cool. Poor jerk. Only thing possessing him was a sixer of Pabst.
3,4,SAM,"So, what's the deal, then?  People in this town getting possessed or not?"
3,4,DEAN,I don't know. Maybe it is just what it is — town full of scumbags.
3,4,SAM,Yeah. Maybe.
3,4,POLICE OFFICER,"You boys ready for your mug shots?  (SAM and DEAN look nervous and the cop hastens to reassure them.)  The photographer's gonna be here in a few, and ... take your picture for the local paper."
3,4,SAM,"Yep, time to go. (rising)"
3,4,DEAN,Wait a second. Wait a second.
3,4,SAM,What?
3,4,DEAN,Where's Richie?
3,4,RICHIE,"So, how's a bartender afford a place like this?"
3,4,CASEY,My parents left it to me.  I don't come out here much — mostly when I want to be alone.
3,4,RICHIE,"Wow. This is, uh, ... charming?   (pause)  You sure you wouldn't be more comfortable in a bedroom or my motel room?  I mean, not for nothing, but, you know, I got oils. (laughs)"
3,4,CASEY,But I have toys.
3,4,RICHIE,"Yeah, no. Toys trump oils."
3,4,DEAN,"How many times i got to tell Richie, he's gonna get himself in trouble?"
3,4,SAM,"Dean, you're assuming he's missing. I mean, maybe he just bailed."
3,4,DEAN,"He's a moron. I mean, he's a sweet moron, but he's not a coward. He wouldn't just bail. I got to go find him."
3,4,SAM,All right.  Meanwhile I think I'm gonna trail this Trotter guy.
3,4,DEAN,Yeah?
3,4,RUBY,Cute piece.
3,4,BOBBY,Who are you?
3,4,RUBY,"It won't stop a demon, if that's what you think."
3,4,BOBBY,How the hell would you know?
3,4,BOBBY,"Well, ain't I lucky, then? Found a subject for a test fire."
3,4,RUBY,"Luck had nothing to do with it. But, hey, by all means. Take your best shot.  (She poses in front of the target, arms outstretched.)"
3,4,RUBY,"(sighs in exasperation) Are you gonna stand there like a pantywaist, or are you gonna shoot…"
3,4,RUBY,Ouch!  That smarts a little.
3,4,BOBBY,What do you want?
3,4,RUBY,Peace on earth.  A new shirt. Now ... do you want me to help you out with that gun or not?  Hmm?
3,4,SAM,Dean. (in a hushed voice)
3,4,DEAN,Sammy.
3,4,SAM,Yeah. Hey. I can't talk right now.
3,4,DEAN,You okay?
3,4,SAM,"Yeah, I'm fine. Just, uh ...  meet me at the bar in 20 minutes, okay?"
3,4,DEAN,Sam!
3,4,WOMAN (husky-voiced),I got to tell you — every woman in this place?  They want to eat you up.
3,4,DEAN,"Well, hey.  Anybody could have tackled that guy … and wrestled the gun away ... prevented mass murder."
3,4,DEAN (incredulous),What do I look like?
3,4,WOMAN,What do I look like? (as she walks away) Cheapskate.
3,4,CASEY,(laughs) Did I just see you strike out with a prostitute? How's that work?
3,4,DEAN,"Well, I just told her I had a thing for the bartender. It was pretty easy."
3,4,CASEY,Who says the bartender's available?
3,4,DEAN,"That's a good question.  You got something going with some guy, you know, about yea tall, wears a sweatsuit ...?"
3,4,CASEY,Who?
3,4,DEAN,Naw. My mistake. What do you say you and me grab a drink after your shift?
3,4,CASEY,I say why wait ... when we can go right now?
3,4,SAM,I think maybe you know.
3,4,TROTTER,"Yeah?  Well, I think I'm calling the cops!"
3,4,TROTTER,"Breaking and entering, assault — you're in a peck of trouble, my friend."
3,4,SAM,"Uh, wh-, uh ...  I think I could probably explain it—"
3,4,TROTTER,Money's in the safe! Take it and go.
3,4,SAM,I don't want your money. I just got to be sure.
3,4,TROTTER,What kind of psycho are you?
3,4,DEAN,Looks like the maid's day off.
3,4,CASEY (laughs),i don't think so.
3,4,DEAN,"Spiritus immunde, undolara. Pasonitote ..."
3,4,DEAN,"What are you laughing at, bitch? You're still trapped."
3,4,CASEY,So are you... bitch.
3,4,CASEY,Lose something?
3,4,DEAN,(laughs) All you demons have such smart mouths.
3,4,CASEY,It's a gift.
3,4,DEAN,"Yeah, well.  Let's see if you're smiling when I send your ass back to Hell."
3,4,CASEY,"Without your little exorcism book? Hey, go ahead."
3,4,CASEY,"Having a little trouble there, sport?"
3,4,DEAN,"(clears throat, begins again) Spiritus immunde, undolare, Pasonitote. (takes a breath, tries and fails to remember the next phrase)"
3,4,CASEY,"Nice try, but I think ... you just ordered a pizza. Guess you should have paid more attention in Latin class."
3,4,DEAN,"Hey, I don't know what you're smiling about. You're not going anywhere."
3,4,CASEY,"And, apparently, neither are you."
3,4,CASEY,"Oh, right — Sam. Everyone says he's the brains of the outfit."
3,4,DEAN,Everyone?
3,4,CASEY,"Sure. You Winchester boys are famous. Not Lohan famous, but, you know..."
3,4,DEAN,"Well, that's ... flattering. I'll be sure to let Sam know when he gets here."
3,4,PROSTITUTE,"You look kind of tense. (SAM looks around to see if she's talking to him.)  You know, I know a surefire way to relax."
3,4,SAM,Maybe later. (to the bartender:) Excuse me. Hi.
3,4,BARMAN,What can I get for you?
3,4,SAM,"Um, you remember the guy I was with last night? We sat right here. Umm...."
3,4,BARMAN,... The big hero who jumped on Reggie.
3,4,SAM,"Yeah, yeah. The — the big hero. Right. Um, have you seen him around at all today?"
3,4,BARMAN,Maybe.  Depends.
3,4,SAM,D-depends on what?
3,4,SAM,"Oh my — !   Does everyone around here have their hand out? (sighs, and pulls out some money and hands it to the BARMAN)"
3,4,BARMAN,He left with Casey about an hour ago.
3,4,SAM,Any idea where they went?
3,4,BARMAN,Her place... for Bible study.
3,4,SAM,"All right, you got an address?"
3,4,BARMAN,"What's wrong with you? You think I'm gonna give you a co-worker's address, just so you can go over there and get your freaky peeping-tom rocks off?  (without pausing SAM hands more money over)  (without pausing the BARMAN continues)  Corner of Piermont and Clinton. Have fun."
3,4,CASEY,Why don't you relax?
3,4,DEAN,Why don't you kiss my ass?
3,4,CASEY,"Why, Dean, you're a poet. I had no idea. Look, we won't have any effect on the outcome of this. We might as well be civil."
3,4,DEAN,"Civil, huh? Killing Richie — that was, that was civil? The guy was harmless."
3,4,CASEY,That knife he pulled on me?  Didn't look so harmless.
3,4,DEAN,"Ah, a knife wouldn't hurt you."
3,4,CASEY,"No, but it would damage this body.   And Casey has such a fine body, I wouldn't want to see it ripped."
3,4,CASEY,"Hey, I didn't pull any triggers."
3,4,DEAN,Yeah? You did something.
3,4,CASEY,You want to know what I did — what I really did?  I had lunch.
3,4,DEAN,Lunch?
3,4,CASEY,"Me and Trotter. He had a cheeseburger, I had a salad, and I just pointed out the money that could be made with a few businesses that cater to harmless vice.  So Trotter built it, and, man, did they come.  Supposedly God-fearing folk, waist-deep in booze, sex, gambling. I barely lifted a finger."
3,4,DEAN,That's it?
3,4,DEAN,And that's how it ends?
3,4,CASEY,No. That's how it begins.
3,4,SAM,Dean?
3,4,SAM,Sulfur.
3,4,DEAN,"So, demons take over. I thought the meek shall inherit the earth."
3,4,CASEY,"Oh, according to your Bible. (Off his look.)  It's only a book, Dean."
3,4,DEAN,Not everyone would agree.
3,4,CASEY,"Because it's God's book?  (pause)  Do you believe in God, Dean? I'd be surprised if you did."
3,4,DEAN,I don't know. I'd like to.
3,4,CASEY,"Don't be hopeful, Dean. You're not delivered.  It's only the wind."
3,4,BARMAN,I guess you got to catch your jollies another night. Here. Why don't you have a drink ... and relax?
3,4,BARMAN,Suit yourself — princess.  (The BARMAN takes the shot he had poured for SAM.)
3,4,SAM,Father.
3,4,FATHER GIL,Yes?
3,4,SAM,"Um... can I, can I talk to you for a sec?"
3,4,DEAN,"You know, you're piling it pretty high there, sweetheart. I'm not sure I'm buying."
3,4,CASEY,Why would I lie?
3,4,DEAN,Demons lie.
3,4,CASEY,Some do.  Some are true believers.
3,4,DEAN,Believers in what?
3,4,CASEY,"What, you think humans have an exclusive on a higher power?"
3,4,DEAN (surprised),You have a god?
3,4,CASEY,Sure. His name's Lucifer.
3,4,DEAN,You mean the Devil?
3,4,DEAN,Lucifer's really real?
3,4,CASEY,"Well, no one's actually seen him, but they say that he made us into what we are, and they say that he'll return."
3,4,DEAN,"Oh, yeah? And, uh, you believe that?"
3,4,CASEY,I've got faith.
3,4,DEAN,Mmm.
3,4,CASEY,"So, you see? Is my kind really all that different than yours?"
3,4,DEAN,"Well, except that, uh, demons are evil."
3,4,CASEY,…and humans are such a lovable bunch. (beat) Dick Cheney.
3,4,DEAN,He one of yours?
3,4,CASEY,Not yet. Let's just say he's got a parking spot reserved for him downstairs.
3,4,DEAN,"(laughs) Hey, speaking of downstairs ... what's it like down there?"
3,4,CASEY,"What, Hell?"
3,4,DEAN,Yeah.
3,4,SAM,"So, the, the bartender the other night, Casey.  You know her pretty well?"
3,4,SAM,"Well, um, she and my brother, they, uh... (pauses, thinking how to say this) they... left tonight. Together."
3,4,FATHER GIL,"Ah.  Well ... not that I approve, but they are consenting adults."
3,4,SAM,Right.
3,4,FATHER GIL,"I, I'm sorry. You said ""brother."" I thought the two of you were insurance investigators?"
3,4,SAM,"Right, right. Well, well we are. Um, it's like, it's like a family business, you know?"
3,4,FATHER GIL,Ah.
3,4,SAM,"Anyways, um, so, so, I went to Casey's apartment, and they weren't there.  I, I, I just have this feeling that they ... that they might be in trouble."
3,4,FATHER GIL,What kind of trouble?
3,4,SAM,"Just ... trouble. Look, please, Father, I, I need your help. Is there anything you could tell me about Casey — anyplace she'd go, maybe ...?"
3,4,FATHER GIL,"Yes, there is a place. Let me get my jacket."
3,4,SAM,"No, wait, wait, wait, Father. I can do this by myself."
3,4,FATHER GIL,"Son, if Casey's really in trouble, then there's nothing to talk about."
3,4,FATHER GIL,Shall we go?
3,4,CASEY,"Kind of funny, don't you think? You and me sitting here like a couple of regular folk."
3,4,DEAN,"Yeah, it's hilarious, you know, in that ... apocalyptic sort of way."
3,4,CASEY,"You're all right, Dean.  (DEAN scoffs.)  The others don't describe you that way.  But, you know, you're — you're likable."
3,4,CASEY,"You could say thanks. (pause) That deal you made to save Sam — a lot of others would mock you for it, think it was weak or stupid. I don't."
3,4,DEAN,"It's been kind of liberating, actually. Y’know, what's the point in worrying about a future, when you don't have one?"
3,4,CASEY,"Still, a year left. You're not scared?"
3,4,DEAN,Nah.
3,4,CASEY,Not even a little?
3,4,FATHER GIL,"So, insurance investigating. You enjoy the work?"
3,4,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I ... like being able to help people."
3,4,FATHER GIL,Ever think about doing anything else?
3,4,SAM,Like what?
3,4,FATHER GIL,"Mmm, anything. You seem like a pretty smart kid. Somehow I see you out in front of the pack. (pause) You could do some great things."
3,4,SAM,"I don't know. I like doing what I'm doing, I guess."
3,4,FATHER GIL,"Well, it's your life. Does, um ... Dean?"
3,4,SAM,"Yeah, Dean."
3,4,FATHER GIL,Does he find trouble often?
3,4,SAM,"Yeah.  Yeah, Dean finds his fair share."
3,4,FATHER GIL,"Well, it's a good thing he has you — his brother's keeper."
3,4,CASEY,I'm an open book.
3,4,DEAN,"So, the gate opened. The demon army was let out. What now, huh? I'm not seeing a big, honking plan here."
3,4,CASEY,"Honestly, there was a plan.  Azazel was a tyrant, but ... he held us all together."
3,4,DEAN,Azazel?
3,4,CASEY,"What, you think his friends just called him “yellow eyes”? He had a name. After you did him in, it all fell apart."
3,4,CASEY,"There was. It was Sam. Sam was supposed to be the grand pooh-bah and lead the big army, but ... he hasn't exactly stepped up to the plate, has he?"
3,4,DEAN,Thank God for that.
3,4,SAM,Dean?!
3,4,CASEY,Looks like you win.
3,4,DEAN,Sam!
3,4,SAM,Dean?
3,4,DEAN,"Sammy, down here! The basement caved in!"
3,4,DEAN,Who's we?
3,4,SAM,I'm here with the Father.
3,4,DEAN,"Sammy, be careful."
3,4,SAM,"Bobby, you all right?"
3,4,BOBBY (nodding),Yeah.
3,4,SAM,How did you know where we—
3,4,CASEY,Stop!
3,4,FATHER GIL,"For centuries. We've been to hell and back, literally."
3,4,CASEY,Leave him be.
3,4,DEAN,"Sam, wait!"
3,4,BOBBY,Two less demons to worry about. That's not nothing.
3,4,DEAN,"Yeah, but Trotter's still alive."
3,4,BOBBY,Humans ain't our job.
3,4,DEAN,"Yeah, but you think anything's really gonna change? I mean maybe these people do just want to really destroy themselves. Maybe it is ... a losing battle."
3,4,BOBBY,Is that you or the demon girl talking?
3,4,DEAN,"Ohhhh, it's me. Demon is dead, and so is that hot girl it was possessing."
3,4,BOBBY,"(sighs)  Well, had to be done. Sam was saving your life."
3,4,BOBBY,Yeah?
3,4,DEAN,"Back in Wyoming, uh, there was this moment. Yellow Eyes said something to me."
3,4,BOBBY,What'd he say?
3,4,DEAN,"That maybe when ... Sam came back from (shrugs) well wherever, ... that maybe he came back different."
3,4,BOBBY,Different how?
3,4,DEAN,"I don't know. Whatever it was, it didn't sound good. You think ... think something's wrong with my brother?"
3,4,BOBBY,(pauses briefly) No. Demons lie. I'm sure Sam's okay.
3,4,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, me too."
3,4,RUBY,Leaving so soon? We haven't even had a chance to celebrate.
3,4,SAM,"Yeah, well you can celebrate without me."
3,4,RUBY,"You're not gonna get all pouty on me now, are you? Come on! You killed two demons today."
3,4,SAM,"Yeah, well, maybe you don't care, but I killed two humans, too."
3,4,RUBY,"Sam, you know what happens when demons piggyback humans. They leave them rode hard and put up wet. Chances are those two would have died a slow, sticky death. You probably did them a favor."
3,4,SAM,"Did them a favor? You're a cold bitch, you know that?"
3,4,RUBY,"Yeah, and this cold bitch has saved your ass a couple of times now. Some respect might be nice. Especially if you want me to help you out with Dean and his little problem."
3,4,SAM,"You know what? You keep dangling that, but last I checked, Dean's still going to Hell."
3,4,RUBY,"Everything in its own time, Sam. But there’s a quid pro quo here. We're in a war."
3,4,SAM,"Right.  But for some reason, you're fighting on our team. Now, tell me, why is that again?"
3,4,RUBY,"Go screw yourself, that's why."
3,4,SAM,Oh I see.
3,4,RUBY,"I don't have to justify my actions to you, Sam.  If you don't want my help, fine.  Then give me the gun and I'll pass it on to someone who will use it."
3,4,SAM,"Well, I don't have to like it."
3,4,RUBY,"No. You wouldn't be Sam if you did. On the bright side, I'll be there with you.  (SAM swallows nervously, looking unhappy.)  That little fallen angel on your shoulder."
3,5,DEAN,"Look, Dad's gone now, and we have to carry out his legacy.  Huntin' down as many evil sons of bitches as we possibly can."
3,5,SAM,Okay.
3,5,DEAN,Wanna know how many how many were little girls with black hair and pale skin?
3,5,SAM,Zero.
3,6,DEAN,"So, I've been waiting since Maple Springs. You got something to tell me?"
3,6,DEAN,No.
3,6,SAM,"... Happy Purim? (laughs)  Dude, I don't know. I have no idea what you're talking about—"
3,6,SAM,Dean ...
3,6,SAM,"You went after her, didn’t you? The Crossroads Demon. After I told you not to."
3,6,SAM,"Yeah, well..."
3,6,SAM,I didn't.
3,6,DEAN,And you shot her.
3,6,SAM,She was a smartass!
3,6,SAM,"Don't you think I might have mentioned that little fact, Dean?  No.  Someone else holds the contract."
3,6,DEAN,Who?
3,6,SAM,She wouldn't say.
3,6,DEAN,"Well, we should find out who. Of course, our best lead would be the Crossroads Demon. Oh, wait a minute..."
3,6,SAM,That's not funny.
3,6,DEAN,"No, it's not! It was a stupid freaking risk, and you shouldn't have done it."
3,6,SAM,"I shouldn't have done it? You're my brother, Dean. And no matter what you do, I'm gonna try and save you. And I'm sure as hell not gonna apologize for it, all right?"
3,6,GERT,But I don't understand. I already went over all this with the other detectives.
3,6,DEAN,"Right, yes. But, see, we're with the Sheriff's Department, not the police department – different departments."
3,6,SAM,"So, Mrs. Case..."
3,6,SAM,"Uh... Well, no. No, not yet."
3,6,GERT,I see.
3,6,DEAN,A boat?
3,6,GERT,"Yes. One minute it was there, then it was gone. It just disappeared right before her eyes. You think it could be a ... ghost ship? Alex thinks it could be a ghost ship.  (She is addressing all her comments to SAM, staring at him intently.)"
3,6,DEAN,What a crazy old broad.
3,6,SAM,Why? Because she believes in ghosts?
3,6,DEAN,"(laughs)  Look at you, sticking up for your girlfriend. You cougar hound."
3,6,SAM,Bite me.
3,6,DEAN,"Hey, not if she bites you first. So, who's this Alex? We got another player in town?"
3,6,SAM,"Maybe, maybe not. Doesn't change our job."
3,6,DEAN,"And what looked like a ghost ship, right?"
3,6,SAM,"Yeah. Every 37 years, like clockwork, reports of a vanishing three-mast clipper ship out in the bay. And every 37 years, a rash of weirdo, dry-land drownings."
3,6,DEAN,"So, whatever's happening is just getting started."
3,6,SAM,Yeah.
3,6,DEAN,What's the lore?
3,6,DEAN,"So, what happens?  You see the ship and then a few hours later, you pucker up and kiss your ass goodbye?"
3,6,SAM,Basically.
3,6,DEAN,What's the next step?
3,6,SAM,I gotta I.D. the boat.
3,6,DEAN,"That shouldn't be too hard. I mean, how many three-mast clipper ships have wrecked off the coast?"
3,6,SAM,"I checked that too, actually. Over one hundred and fifty."
3,6,DEAN,Wow.
3,6,SAM,Yeah.
3,6,DEAN,Crap.
3,6,SAM,Mm-hmm.
3,6,DEAN,"This is where we parked the car, right?"
3,6,SAM,I thought so.
3,6,DEAN,Where's my car?
3,6,SAM,Did you feed the meter?
3,6,SAM,"Hey, hey, hey!  Calm down.  Dea—"
3,6,SAM,"(after looking around, hears DEAN gasping and runs over to him)
Whoa. Dean. Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy."
3,6,SAM,Bela.
3,6,BELA,I'm sorry. I had that car towed.
3,6,DEAN,You what?!
3,6,BELA,"Well, it was in a tow-away zone."
3,6,SAM,You're Alex. You're working with that old lady.
3,6,BELA,Gert's a dear old friend.
3,6,DEAN,"Yeah, right. What's your angle?"
3,6,BELA,"There's no angle. There's a lot of lovely old women like Gert up and down the eastern seaboard. I sell them charms, perform séances so they can commune with their dead cats."
3,6,DEAN,"And let me guess, it's all a con, none of it's real."
3,6,BELA,The comfort I provide them is very real.
3,6,SAM,How do you sleep at night?
3,6,BELA,"On silk sheets, rolling naked in money.  (DEAN visualizes, nods slightly.)  Really, Sam. I'd expect the attitude from him, but you?"
3,6,DEAN,"You do know what's going on around here. This ghost-ship thing, it is real."
3,6,BELA,"I'm aware. Thanks for telling Gert the case wasn't solved, by the way."
3,6,DEAN,It isn't.
3,6,BELA,She didn't know that. Now the old bag's stopped payment and she's demanding some real answers. Look... just stay out of my way before you cause any more trouble. I'd get to that car if I were you... before they find the arsenal in the trunk.  (She turns around.)  Ciao.
3,6,DEAN,Can I shoot her?
3,6,SAM,Not in public.
3,6,BELA,"I am so sorry for your loss, Mr. Warren. Now, if you could just tell me one more time about the ship your brother saw."
3,6,DEAN,"Ma'am, I think this man's been through quite enough. You should go."
3,6,BELA,But I just have a few more questions.
3,6,SAM (firmly),"No, you don't."
3,6,DEAN,"Sorry you had to deal with that. They're like ROACHES (his voice raises so that BELA, walking away, can hear; she turns and looks back at him)"
3,6,MR. WARREN,"Yeah, that's right."
3,6,DEAN,Did he tell you what it looked like?
3,6,SAM,That's a lot of detail for a ship your brother saw.
3,6,MR. WARREN,"My brother and I were night diving. I saw the ship, too."
3,6,DEAN,"All right. Well, we'll be in touch."
3,6,SAM,Thank you.
3,6,BELA,I see you got your car back.
3,6,DEAN,You really want to come near me when I got a loaded gun in my hands?
3,6,BELA,"Now, now. Mind your blood pressure. Why are you even still here? You have enough to I.D. the boat."
3,6,SAM,That guy back there saw the ship.
3,6,BELA,Yeah? And?
3,6,SAM,"And, he's going to die, so we have to save him."
3,6,BELA,How sweet.
3,6,DEAN,You think this is funny?
3,6,BELA,"He's cannon fodder. He can't be saved in time, and you know it."
3,6,DEAN,"Yeah, well, see, we have souls, so ... we're gonna try."
3,6,BELA,"Yeah, well, I'm actually going to find the ship and put an end to this. But you have fun."
3,6,DEAN,"Hey, Bela, how'd you get like this, huh? What, did Daddy not give you enough hugs or something?"
3,6,BELA,I don't know. Your daddy give you enough? Don't you dare look down your nose at me. You're not better than I am.
3,6,DEAN,We help people.
3,6,BELA,"(scoffs) Come on. You do this out of vengeance and obsession. You're a stone's throw from being a serial killer. Whereas I, on the other hand, I get paid to do a job and I do it. So, you tell me – which is healthier?"
3,6,SAM,"Bela, why don't you just leave? We've got work to do."
3,6,BELA,Yeah. You're 0 for 2. Bang-up job so far.
3,6,She leaves.,
3,6,DEAN,Anything good?
3,6,SAM,"No, not really. I mean, both brothers are Duke University grads. No criminal record. I mean, a few speeding tickets. They inherited their father's real estate fortune six years ago."
3,6,DEAN,How much?
3,6,SAM,$112 million.
3,6,SAM,"Yeah. I mean, nice, clean, aboveboard. So why did they see the ship? Why Sheila, too? What do they all have in common?"
3,6,DEAN,Maybe nothing.
3,6,SAM,No. There's always something.
3,6,PETER,What are you guys doing?! You watching me?
3,6,SAM,"Sir, calm down. Please."
3,6,PETER,You guys aren't cops! Not dressed like that. Not – not in that crappy car.
3,6,DEAN,"Whoa, hey. No need to get nasty."
3,6,SAM,"We are cops, okay? We're undercover. We're here because we think you're in danger."
3,6,PETER,From who?!
3,6,SAM,"If you just settle down, we'll talk about it."
3,6,SAM,Wait!
3,6,DEAN,"Hey, you moron! We're trying to help you!"
3,6,DEAN,That can't be good.
3,6,SAM,Peter!
3,6,DEAN,Sam!
3,6,DEAN,(Shuts off radio) Do you wanna say it or should I?
3,6,SAM,What?
3,6,DEAN,"You can't save everybody, Sam."
3,6,SAM,"Yeah, right, so – so what, you feel better now or what?"
3,6,DEAN,"No, not really."
3,6,SAM,Me neither.
3,6,DEAN,You gotta understa—
3,6,INTERIOR,"SAM is reading, DEAN on his phone."
3,6,BELA,"That well, huh?"
3,6,DEAN,"If you say 'I told you so', I swear to God I'll start swinging."
3,6,BELA,"Look, I think the three of us should have a heart-to-heart."
3,6,DEAN,That's assuming that you have a heart.
3,6,BELA,"Dean, please... I'm sorry about what I said before, okay? I come bearing gifts."
3,6,SAM,Such as?
3,6,BELA,I've ID'd the ship. (She starts to unzip a portfolio file.)
3,6,SAM,Which would explain the 37 year cycle.
3,6,BELA,Aren't you a sharp tack? (beat) There's a photo of him somewhere ... (flipping through file) ... here.
3,6,DEAN,Isn't that the customer we saw last night?
3,6,BELA,You saw him?
3,6,DEAN,"Yeah, that's him, except he was missing a hand."
3,6,BELA,His right hand?
3,6,SAM,How'd you know?
3,6,BELA,"The sailor's body was cremated, but not before they cut off his hand to make a hand of glory."
3,6,DEAN,A hand of glory?  I think I got one of those at the end of my Thai massage last week (laughs).
3,6,SAM,"Dean, the right hand of a hanged man is a serious occult object.  It's very powerful."
3,6,BELA,So they say.
3,6,DEAN,And officially counts as remains.
3,6,SAM,"But still, none of this explains why the ghost is choosing these victims."
3,6,BELA,"I'll tell you why.  Who cares? Find the hand, burn it, and stop the bloody thing."
3,6,DEAN,I don't get it. Why are you telling us all of this?
3,6,BELA,Because I know exactly where the hand is.
3,6,DEAN,Where?
3,6,BELA,At the Sea Pines Museum. It's a macabre bit of maritime history. But I need help.
3,6,SAM,What kind of help?
3,6,BELA,(to DEAN) What is taking so long? Sam's already halfway there... with his date.
3,6,DEAN,So not okay with this!
3,6,BELA,"What are you, a woman? Come down already."
3,6,DEAN,"All right, get it out – I look ridiculous."
3,6,BELA,Not exactly the word I'd use.
3,6,DEAN,What?
3,6,BELA,"You know, when this is over, we should really have angry sex."
3,6,DEAN,(beat; shifts uncomfortably) Don't objectify me. (beat) Let’s go.
3,6,BELA,"Are you chewing gum? (beat) Try to behave as if you've lived this life before, yeah?"
3,6,GERT,"This'll get their tongues wagging, eh, my Adonis?"
3,6,SAM,"(sighs) Just remember, we're on business."
3,6,GERT,"Ooooh, but sometimes business can be pleasure, hmm?  (she slides a hand up his chest seductively)"
3,6,SAM,"You know, uh, could you excuse me for a moment?"
3,6,GERT,Of course.  (She makes a sort of coochie-coo expression at SAM.)
3,6,SAM,Great.  Thanks.  Thanks.  (SAM pats her hand and walks over to BELA and DEAN.) Exactly how long do you expect me to entertain my date?
3,6,BELA,As long as it takes.
3,6,DEAN,"Look, there's security all over this place, all right. This is an uncrashable party without Gert's invitation, so..."
3,6,SAM,"We can crash anything, Dean."
3,6,DEAN,"Yeah, I know, but this is easier and it's a lot more entertaining."
3,6,SAM,"You know there are limits to what I'll do, right?"
3,6,DEAN,"Ah, he's playing hard to get, that's cute. Come on. (sighs) I want all the details in the morning!"
3,6,BELA,Thank you.
3,6,GERT,To us.
3,6,BELA,Private security?
3,6,DEAN,I don't think so. Look at the way they're standing.  They're pros. Probably state troopers moonlighting.
3,6,BELA,"Posted to every door, too."
3,6,DEAN,"Yeah, I don't think we're just going to be able to waltz upstairs."
3,6,BELA,What do you suggest?
3,6,DEAN,I'm thinking.
3,6,BELA,Don't strain yourself. (beat)  Interesting how the legend is so much more than the man.
3,6,DEAN,"You got any bright ideas, I'm all ears."
3,6,BELA,"Okay. (BELA groans and falls into DEAN's arms toward the floor. DEAN, holding her, kneels down next to her.)"
3,6,DEAN,"Honey?  Honey, are you all right?  (DEAN looks around, calls a waiter over.)  Waiter!  Hi.  Uh, my wife has a severe shellfish allergy. Th-ere's no crab in that?  Is there?"
3,6,WAITER,"No, sir."
3,6,DEAN,"No?  (He takes an appetizer from the silver tray and shoves it in his mouth.) Oh they're excellent, by the way. (talking with his mouth full)"
3,6,GUARD approaches,What seems to be the trouble?
3,6,DEAN,"Ah ... champagne!  My wife, she's a lightweight when it comes to the sauce. Is there somewhere I can lay her down till she gets her sea legs back?"
3,6,DEAN,"Right. (Hands BELA's purse to the GUARD.)  Thank you. (DEAN groans as he lifts BELA up)  Come on, you lush."
3,6,DEAN (sighs),"(To GUARD) You think she's a pain in the ass now, try living with her.  (BELA's eyes pop open.)  Thank you very much. (DEAN sees the GUARD to the door, possibly tipping him or just getting BELA's purse back? and shuts it behind him as BELA sits up.)"
3,6,BELA,I didn't want you thinking.  You're not very good at that.
3,6,BELA,"Oh, look at you.  Searching for a witty rejoinder."
3,6,DEAN,Screw you.
3,6,GERT,Where's Alex and your friend? They're missing a great party.
3,6,SAM,"Umm, ah, I'm sure they’re entertaining themselves."
3,6,GERT,"Oooh, naughty. Then I guess we'll just have to entertain ourselves as well."
3,6,GERT,Call me Gert.
3,6,SAM,(makes an awkward noise) Okay.
3,6,SAM,Whoa-oa!  Unh....
3,6,GERT,"Mmmm, you're just firm all over, ooh, mmm.  (laughs and moans)"
3,6,GUARD,Sir? Ma'am? Everything all right?
3,6,BELA,"(answers the door clutching at her dress, gasping, and smiling as if caught in the act) Hi."
3,6,GUARD,"Feeling better, I see."
3,6,BELA,"Yes, much.  Thank you."
3,6,GUARD,"So, if you're done with the room...?"
3,6,BELA,Well... not exactly.  Could we have a few more minutes?
3,6,GUARD,Uh....  Yes ma'am.
3,6,BELA,"(BELA closes the door and giggles loudly: ""Stop it!  That tickles!"")"
3,6,DEAN,"Whoa.  Sorry!  It's, uh ... nature called."
3,6,GUARD,Ah huh.
3,6,DEAN,Thanks for looking after my wife.
3,6,GUARD,"Oh, she's ... being looked after, all right."
3,6,DEAN,Any trouble?
3,6,BELA,Nothing I couldn't handle. The hand?  (DEAN pulls a wizened human hand out of his pocket. BELA approaches and holds out her own hand.)  May I?
3,6,DEAN,"No.  (DEAN pulls it back away from her, then unfolds a handkerchief to wrap it.)"
3,6,BELA,It might be more inconspicuous in my purse.
3,6,DEAN,Nice try.
3,6,BELA,Just trying to be helpful.
3,6,DEAN,"Well, sweetheart, I don't need your kind of help.  (DEAN tucks the hand back into his jacket pocket.)"
3,6,SAM,"Man, this is one long song."
3,6,GERT,(Breathes deeply) I hope it never ends. (pause while SAM looks deeply pained) How's the investigation going?
3,6,SAM,These things take time.
3,6,GERT,People are talking about the Warren brothers’ deaths. Strange. Do you think it’s connected to Shelia's?
3,6,SAM,"Yeah.  Yeah, we think so."
3,6,GERT,"I think they had it coming, you know. In a Biblical sort of way."
3,6,SAM,What do you mean?
3,6,GERT,You know about their father?
3,6,SAM,No?
3,6,GERT,"Come here, I'll whisper it to you."
3,6,SAM,(as GERT pulls his head down to her mouth) Uh—
3,6,SAM (grimacing),Then how?
3,6,SAM,"Okay, okay, okay.  (wincing and pulling away)  Um, um, so did, did, did Sheila have any connection to them?"
3,6,GERT,"Well, none that I know of."
3,6,SAM,Did Sheila have any kind of tragedy in her life?
3,6,GERT,Yes.  As a matter of fact there was a ... car accident when she was a teenager.
3,6,SAM,What happened?
3,6,GERT,"Her car flipped over.  She was okay but her cousin Brian was killed. Why, is that important?"
3,6,SAM,Uh...
3,6,BELA,Well!  Having a nice time?
3,6,BELA,Oh!
3,6,BELA,(whispering to SAM & DEAN) I'm going to get Gert into a cold shower.
3,6,SAM,Great idea.
3,6,DEAN,You stink like sex.
3,6,SAM,"You got it, right? Tell me I didn't get groped all night by Mrs. Havisham for nothing."
3,6,DEAN,I got it... Mrs. Who?
3,6,SAM,Never mind.  Just let me see it.
3,6,SAM,What?
3,6,DEAN,I'm gonna kill her.
3,6,BELA,"Oh, no."
3,6,DEAN,"You know what, you’re right. I'm not gonna kill her. I think slow torture's the way to go."
3,6,SAM,"Dean, look, you gotta relax."
3,6,DEAN,"Relax!  Oh yeah, yeah, I'll relax.  I can't believe she got another one over on us!"
3,6,DEAN,What?
3,6,SAM,"I...I mean, she got ... one over ... on you, ... not us."
3,6,DEAN (pause),(loudly) Thank you!  Sam. Very helpful.
3,6,BELA,Hello?  Could you open up? (DEAN opens the door) Just let me explain.  (SAM and DEAN look pissed.)
3,6,SAM,So the whole reason for us going to the charity ball was...?
3,6,BELA,I needed a cover. (SAM nods.)  You were convenient.
3,6,SAM,"Look, you sold it to a buyer. Just go buy it back."
3,6,BELA,It's halfway across the ocean. I can't get it back in time.
3,6,DEAN,In time for what?
3,6,SAM,"What's going on with you, Bela? You look like you've seen a ghost."
3,6,BELA,I saw the ship.
3,6,DEAN,"You what?  (pause) Wow, you know, I – I knew you were an immoral thieving con artist bitch, but just when I thought my opinion of you couldn't get any lower—"
3,6,BELA,What are you talking about?
3,6,SAM,We figured out the spirit’s motive. (He shows BELA a photograph) This is the captain of our ship. The one who hung our ghost boy.
3,6,BELA,So?
3,6,SAM,"So they were brothers. Very Cain and Abel. So now our spirit, he's going after a very specific kind of target – people who've spilled their own family’s blood.  (BELA looks stunned.)  See first there was Sheila who killed her cousin in the car accident, and the Warren brothers, who murdered their father for the inheritance.  And now you."
3,6,BELA,Oh my God.
3,6,DEAN,"So who was it, Bela?  Hmm?  Who'd you kill?  Was it Daddy?  Your little sis, maybe?"
3,6,BELA,It's none of your business.
3,6,DEAN,"No?  Riight.  Well, have a nice life – you know, whatever’s left of it.  (DEAN slaps her on the back.)  Sam, let’s go."
3,6,BELA,You can't just leave me here.
3,6,DEAN,Watch us.
3,6,BELA,"Please.  (SAM looks down, moved.)  I need your help."
3,6,DEAN,Our help? Now how could a couple of serial killers possibly help you?
3,6,BELA,"Okay, that was a bit harsh, I admit it, but it doesn't warrant a death sentence."
3,6,SAM,"That's not why you’re gonna die. What'd you do, Bela?"
3,6,BELA,"You wouldn't understand.  No one did. Never mind.  I'll just do what I've always done, I'll deal with it myself."
3,6,DEAN,You do realize you just sold the one thing that could save your life.
3,6,BELA (sadly),I'm aware.
3,6,SAM,Well ... (sighs) maybe not the only thing.
3,6,DEAN,Sammy!  You better start reading.
3,6,DEAN (shouting),Stay close!
3,6,BELA,Behind you!
3,6,DEAN,"Sammy, read faster!"
3,6,SAILOR'S GHOST,You... hanged me!
3,6,SAILOR'S BROTHER,I'm sorry.
3,6,SAILOR'S GHOST,Your own brother.
3,6,SAILOR'S BROTHER,I'm so sorry!
3,6,BELA,You boys should learn to lock your doors. Anyone could just barge in.
3,6,SAM,Anyone just did. Did you come to say goodbye or thank you?
3,6,BELA,"I've come to settle affairs. Giving the spirit what he really wanted, his own brother – very clever, Sam. So here. (She tosses them each a packet of money.)  It's ten thousand – that should cover it. (The boys look at the packets of money and then at BELA.)   I don't like being in anyone’s debt."
3,6,DEAN,So ponying up ten grand is easier for you than a simple thank you?  (She smiles faintly. DEAN shakes his head.)  You're so damaged.
3,6,BELA,(her smile broadens) Takes one to know one. Goodbye lads. (she turns around leaves)
3,6,SAM,She got style. You gotta give her that.
3,6,DEAN,I suppose.
3,6,SAM,"You know, Dean, we don't know where this money's been."
3,6,DEAN,"No, but I know where it's going... A-HA HA!"
3,6,SAM,Seriously? Atlantic City?
3,6,DEAN,"You know, situation was reversed, I guess I'd've done the same thing. (pause) I mean I'm not blind, I see what you're going through with this whole deal, me going away and all that. But you're gonna be okay."
3,6,DEAN,"Yeah, you'll keep hunting, y'know, you live your life. You’re stronger than me.  You are!  (SAM clears his throat) you are... you'll get over it. But I want you to know I'm sorry, I’m sorry for... putting you through all this, I am."
3,6,SAM,"You know what, Dean?  Go screw yourself."
3,6,DEAN,What?
3,6,SAM,"I don't want an apology from you!  And by the way, I'm a big boy now, I can take care of myself."
3,6,DEAN,"Oh, well, excuse me."
3,6,DEAN,I think maybe I'll play craps.
3,7,BELA,It's rude to sneak up on people.
3,7,GORDON,Bela Talbot.
3,7,BELA,You have me at a disadvantage. I don't know who you are.
3,7,GORDON,Gordon Walker.
3,7,BELA,(pause)  I've heard of you. Heard you were in prison.
3,7,GORDON,Got out.
3,7,BELA,Released early on good behavior?
3,7,BELA,I don't think I know.
3,7,BELA,"Put that down.  (He doesn't.)  What's so pressing about finding the boys, anyway?"
3,7,GORDON,Sam Winchester's the Antichrist.
3,7,BELA,Mmm.  I'd heard something about that...
3,7,GORDON,It's true.
3,7,BELA,"... from my good friend, the Easter Bunny, who'd heard it from the Tooth Fairy. Are you off your meds?"
3,7,GORDON,"The world hangs in the balance. So you go ahead and be a smart-ass, but tell me where they are, or I shoot."
3,7,BELA,"Gordon, you and I don't know each other very well, so let me tell you a little something about me. I don't respond well to threats, but you make me an offer?  And I think you'll find me highly cooperative."
3,7,BELA,Kill me. Good luck finding Sam and Dean.
3,7,BELA,I don't get out of bed for three grand.
3,7,GORDON,You...
3,7,BELA,"Scratch that. Give me the mojo bag, and we'll call it even."
3,7,GORDON,"Oh, hell no. This thing's a century old. It's..."
3,7,BELA,"Priceless. Believe me, I know. Now, how badly do you want the Winchesters?"
3,7,BELA,"Hello, Dean? Hey, where are you?"
3,7,SAM,"Hey, hey. Don't worry. We're gonna call you some help, okay?"
3,7,DEAN,Where is she? Where'd she go?!
3,7,DEAN (panting),Whoo!
3,7,DEAN,What?
3,7,SAM,"Cutting it a little close, don't you think?"
3,7,DEAN,"Ah ... that's just chum in the water. Worked, didn't it?"
3,7,DEAN,Ow.
3,7,DEAN,Your nest... where you and your bloodsucking pals hang out.
3,7,VAMPIRE,I don't know what you're talking about. (SAM and DEAN look at each other and roll their eyes.)  Please! I don't feel good.
3,7,DEAN,"Yeah, well, you're gonna feel a hell of a lot worse if we give you another shot of dead man's blood."
3,7,VAMPIRE,Just let me go.
3,7,SAM,"(laughs)  Yeah, you know we can't do that."
3,7,VAMPIRE,I'm telling you the truth. I'm just... I took something. I'm freaking out! I don't know what's going on!
3,7,SAM,You took something?
3,7,SAM,What's your name?
3,7,VAMPIRE,Lucy. Please.  Just let me go.
3,7,SAM,"All right, Lucy, how about this? If you tell us what happened, we'll let you go."
3,7,SAM,Spider?
3,7,LUCY,"The club, on Jefferson. And there was this guy... he was buying me drinks."
3,7,SAM,This guy... what's he look like?
3,7,LUCY,"He was old, like thirty. He had brown hair, a leather jacket... uh, Deacon or Dixon or something. Said he was a dealer... he had something for me."
3,7,DEAN,Something?
3,7,LUCY,"Something new. ""Better than anything you've ever tried."" He put a few drops in my drink."
3,7,LUCY,What?
3,7,DEAN,"Yeah, you just took a big steamin' shot of the nastiest virus out there."
3,7,LUCY,"You're crazy! He gave me roofies or something! No... The next thing I know, we're at his place, and he says he's gonna get me something to eat, just wait. But I get so hungry."
3,7,DEAN,So you busted out?
3,7,DEAN,Lights are too bright? Sunshine hurt your skin?
3,7,DEAN,"Well, I hate to tell you this, sweetheart, but your blood's never pumping again."
3,7,DEAN,"All right, listen, Wavy Gravy.  It's not going to stop. You've already killed two people, almost three."
3,7,LUCY,"(sobbing) No, I couldn't. No-!  I was hallucinating!"
3,7,DEAN,"You killed them, all right? We've been following a sloppy trail of corpses, and it leads straight to you."
3,7,LUCY,"No. No, it wasn't real! It was the drug! Please! Please, you have to help me!"
3,7,LUCY,"No, no."
3,7,DEAN,We don't have a choice.
3,7,LUCY,No... please!
3,7,GORDON,Sir.  A few questions about the attack.
3,7,MAN,I already talked to the cops.
3,7,MAN,FBI?
3,7,KUBRICK,Can you describe your attacker?
3,7,MAN,"Uh .... She was crazy. She had that, uh, super-PCP strength, you know? She GNAWED on my neck."
3,7,GORDON,And did she bleed on you?
3,7,MAN,On me?  No.
3,7,MAN,"Yeah, I'm sure. Why do you ask?"
3,7,GORDON,This woman has a very dangerous virus.
3,7,MAN,What? She bit me in the neck!
3,7,KUBRICK,The bite doesn't matter. You have to actually ingest the blood to be infected.
3,7,MAN,(sighs in relief)
3,7,GORDON,"Good thing, too. We'd have had to kill you."
3,7,GORDON,The attack?
3,7,MAN,"She jumped me, then bit me. Then those two guys found me and chased her down the alley."
3,7,GORDON,What did they look like?
3,7,MAN,"Ah, I didn't get a good look."
3,7,GORDON,Think.
3,7,MAN,One of them was real tall.
3,7,DEAN,"That was a big, fat waste of time."
3,7,SAM,"Look, three blondes have gone missing, including Lucy, all last sighted here. I'm telling you, Dean, this is the hunting ground."
3,7,GIRL,You're sick. (laughing)
3,7,MAN,"You ready, sweetie? One taste of this, you'll never be the same."
3,7,SAM,Get out of here. go! go!
3,7,SAM,Dean!
3,7,DEAN,All right. Run. I'll draw them off.
3,7,SAM,"What?! No, you're crazy!"
3,7,SAM,There you are!
3,7,SAM,"Nice move you pulled back there, Dean running right at the weapons!"
3,7,SAM,"Uh, yeah, I guess so. You know, how the hell did he know where to find us?"
3,7,DEAN,"Question for you. When you called me yesterday, it wasn't to thank me for saving your ass, was it?"
3,7,BELA (unabashed),No.  Gordon Walker paid me to tell him where you were.
3,7,DEAN,Excuse me?
3,7,BELA (laughing),"Well, he had a gun on me. What else was I supposed to do?"
3,7,BELA,"Ah.  I did fully intend to call, I just got a bit sidetracked."
3,7,DEAN,He tried to kill us!
3,7,DEAN,"Bela, if we make it out of this alive, the first thing I'm gonna do is kill you."
3,7,BELA,You're not serious.
3,7,DEAN,Listen to my voice and tell me if I'm serious.
3,7,GORDON,Who are they?
3,7,VAMPIRE,Family.
3,7,GORDON,You always keep your family in shackles?
3,7,VAMPIRE,We're still getting to know each other. They have just been reborn.
3,7,GORDON,You mean you grabbed some poor girls off the street and made them monsters like you.
3,7,VAMPIRE,"I do what I have to. We're a dying breed. But then, you know that, don't you Gordon? Gordon. Walker. One of the greatest  living vampire hunters."
3,7,GORDON,In the flesh.
3,7,VAMPIRE,"You're a big part of why my people are nearly extinct, Gordon."
3,7,GORDON (scoffs),"Your ""people"" are going extinct because you're a bunch of mindless, bloodthirsty animals."
3,7,VAMPIRE,Watch your mouth.
3,7,GORDON,"Oh, did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry. I forgot you're just a misunderstood victim. Even though you murder and spread your filthy disease on pure base instinct. You got less humanity than a sewer rat."
3,7,VAMPIRE,I'm sorry you have such a low opinion of my people.
3,7,GORDON,"Oh, you have no idea."
3,7,SAM,"That vampire's still out there, Dean."
3,7,DEAN,First things first.
3,7,SAM,Gordon.
3,7,DEAN,"About that. When we find him, or if he finds us... Well I'm just saying he's not leaving us a whole lot of options."
3,7,SAM (shrugs),"No, I'm done. I mean, Gordon's not gonna stop until we're dead... or till he is."
3,7,DEAN,What?!
3,7,DEAN,You're a hundred miles away. How the hell did you—
3,7,BELA,Hello?  Purveyor of powerful occult objects?  I used a talking board to contact the other side.
3,7,DEAN,And?
3,7,BELA,"Warehouse. Two stories, riverfront, neon sign outside."
3,7,DEAN,Thanks.
3,7,BELA,"One more thing. The spirit had a message for you. ""Leave town, run like hell, and whatever you do, don't go after Gordon."" For whatever that's worth."
3,7,WOMAN,Please...  Help us. Please.
3,7,Cut to,"GORDON walking outside. He flinches at every sudden light and sound, stares up at a loudly buzzing, glaringly bright street lamp. He covers his ears in agony as a car passes him, trailing red light behind."
3,7,Cut to,"The man finishes changing the tire and gets in his car. Before he can start the ignition, GORDON sits up suddenly in the back seat and grabs the man from behind. From outside, we hear the man scream, and see the car shake violently and a spray of blood stain the windshield."
3,7,VAMPIRE,Go ahead. Do it. KILL me.
3,7,SAM,What happened here?
3,7,VAMPIRE,Gordon Walker. I never should have brought a hunter here. Never. I just... I just wanted some kind of revenge. Stupid... exposing him to my family.
3,7,DEAN,"Oh, yeah, you're such a family man."
3,7,DEAN,"I don't want to understand, you son of—"
3,7,VAMPIRE,I was desperate! You ever felt desperate? (shot of DEAN's face) I've lost everyone I ever loved. I'm staring down eternity alone.  (shot of DEAN's face) Can you think of a worse hell?
3,7,DEAN,"Well, there's Hell."
3,7,VAMPIRE,I wasn't thinking. I just ... I didn't care anymore. Do you know it's like when you just don't give a damn? It's like ... it's like being dead already. So just go ahead. (looks down at DEAN's knife) Do it.
3,7,GORDON,Not even close.
3,7,KUBRICK,I thought maybe you were dead. (GORDON scoffs.) What is it?
3,7,GORDON,Something ... happened.
3,7,KUBRICK,What?
3,7,GORDON,They turned me.
3,7,KUBRICK,'They' those fangs?  (pause)  I'm sorry. You know what this means.
3,7,KUBRICK,What do you mean?
3,7,GORDON,You have to let me do one last thing first
3,7,KUBRICK,What?
3,7,GORDON,Kill Sam Winchester.
3,7,KUBRICK,Gordon...
3,7,GORDON,"It's the only... it is the one good thing to come out of this nightmare.  I'm stronger, I'm faster – I can finish him."
3,7,KUBRICK,Gordon ... I'm sorry. You know I can't let you walk out of here.
3,7,GORDON,"Listen to me. There is nothing more important. Please. (pause, GORDON walks and faces the crucifix) I can do one last good thing for the world."
3,7,KUBRICK,"Yeah. I hear you. You know, Gordon, you're right. One last good thing."
3,7,DEAN,"Man, I must have checked three dozen motels, empty buildings, warehouses ..."
3,7,SAM,"Yeah, me too. Big city."
3,7,SAM,"Yeah, he'll be unstoppable. Hey, uh, give me your phone."
3,7,DEAN,What for?
3,7,DEAN,"Oh, yeah. (hands phone over) Thanks."
3,7,DEAN,"Sammy, stay here."
3,7,SAM,What? Where you going now?
3,7,SAM,What?
3,7,DEAN,You heard me.
3,7,SAM,"Not alone, you're not."
3,7,DEAN,"Sam, I don't need you to sign me a permission slip, okay? He's after you, not me, and he's turbocharged. I want you to stay out of harm's way. I'll take care of it."
3,7,SAM,"Well, Dean, you're not going by yourself.  You're gonna get yourself killed!"
3,7,DEAN,Just another day at the office. It's a massively dangerous day at the office (smirking)
3,7,SAM,"So you're the guy with nothing to lose now, huh? Oh wait, let me guess. Because, uh, it's because you're already dead, right?"
3,7,DEAN,If the shoe fits.
3,7,SAM,"You know what, man? I'm sick and tired of your kamikaze trip"
3,7,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, kamikaze? I'm more like a ninja."
3,7,SAM,That's not funny.
3,7,DEAN,It's a little funny.
3,7,SAM,No. It's not.
3,7,DEAN,"What do you want me to do, Sam, huh? Sit around all day writing sad poems about how I'm gonna die? You know what? I got one. Let's see, what rhymes with ""shut up, Sam""?"
3,7,SAM,"Dude, drop the attitude, Dean. Quit turning everything into a punch line. And you know something else? Stop trying to act like you're not afraid"
3,7,DEAN,I'm not!
3,7,SAM,You're lying. And you may as well drop it 'cause I can see right through you.
3,7,DEAN,You got no idea what you're talking about.
3,7,SAM,"Yeah, I do. You're scared, Dean. You're scared because your year is running out, and you're still going to Hell, and you're freaked."
3,7,DEAN,And how do you know that?
3,7,SAM,Because I know you!
3,7,DEAN,Really?
3,7,SAM,"Yeah, I've been following you around my entire life! I mean, I've been looking up to you since I was four, Dean. Studying you, trying to be just like my big brother. So yeah, I know you. Better than anyone else in the entire world. And this is exactly how you act when you're terrified. And, I mean, I can't blame you. It's just... (pause)"
3,7,DEAN,What?
3,7,SAM,I wish you would drop the show and be my brother again. 'Cause... (can't find words; tears in his eyes) just 'cause.
3,7,SAM,"You've had that phone two hours, Dean. Who'd you give the number to?"
3,7,GORDON,Dean.
3,7,DEAN,How'd you get this number?
3,7,GORDON,"Your scent's all over the cellphone store. Of course, I can't smell you now. Where are you?"
3,7,DEAN,"Well, I guess you'll just have to find us, won't you."
3,7,GORDON,I'd rather you come to me
3,7,DEAN,"What's the matter, Gordo? You're not afraid of us, are you? We're just sitting here. Bring it on!"
3,7,GORDON,I don't think so.
3,7,WOMAN crying.,Please. Please.
3,7,DEAN,"Gordon, let the girl go."
3,7,GORDON,"Bye, Dean."
3,7,DEAN,Gordon! Don't do this. You don't kill innocent people. You're still a hunter.
3,7,GORDON,No. I'm a monster.
3,7,DEAN,Sam!
3,7,SAM,Dean!
3,7,DEAN,"Damn it, Sam!"
3,7,SAM,Gordon!  You got me where you want me. You might as well come out and fight!
3,7,SAM,"So, this is really the way you want to do it, huh?"
3,7,GORDON,Damn right I do.
3,7,GORDON (continuing),"You have no idea what I faced to get here. I lost everything. My life. But it's worth it, 'cause I'm finally gonna kill the most dangerous thing I ever hunted. You're not human, Sam."
3,7,SAM,Look who's talking.
3,7,GORDON,You're right. I'm a bloodthirsty killer.
3,7,SAM,Don't talk about it like you don't have a choice.
3,7,GORDON,I don't.
3,7,SAM,"Yes you do, Gordon. You didn't kill that girl."
3,7,GORDON,"No, I didn't. I did something much, much worse."
3,7,GORDON,"I got to hand it to you, Sam. You got a lot of people fooled. But see, I know the truth. I know what it's like. We're the same now, you and me. I know how it is walking around with something evil inside you. It's just too bad you won't do the right thing and kill yourself. I'm gonna ... as soon as I'm done with you. Two last good deeds. Killing you, and killing myself."
3,7,SAM,No!
3,7,DEAN,"You just charged a super-vamped-out Gordon with no weapon. That's a little reckless, don't you think?"
3,7,SAM,Here you go.
3,7,DEAN,Thanks.
3,7,SAM,Figure out what's making that rattle?
3,7,DEAN,"Not yet. Give me a box wrench, would you?"
3,7,SAM,Yeah. There you go.
3,7,SAM,Wrong one?
3,7,DEAN,"No no no, come here for a second."
3,7,SAM,"Yeah, uh, valve cover covers the heads."
3,7,DEAN,Carburetor.
3,7,SAM,Yeah.
3,7,DEAN,Very good.
3,7,DEAN,"Yeah, I do. You fix it."
3,7,SAM,"Dean, you barely let me drive this thing."
3,7,DEAN,"Well, it's time. You should know how to fix it. You're gonna need to know these things for the future. (They look at each other.)  And besides, that's my job, right?  Show my little brother the ropes?"
3,7,DEAN,Put your shoulder into it.
3,7,END EPISODE,
3,8,STEVIE,"Merry Christmas, Grandpa."
3,8,GRANDPA,"Oh ho ho, Merry Christmas to you too, Stevie. (Hugs his grandson tight and comes inside)"
3,8,STEVIE,Did you bring me any presents?
3,8,GRANDPA,"Now, why would I want to do that?"
3,8,STEVIE,’Cause it’s Christmas.
3,8,GRANDPA,"Oh!  I thought Santa Claus brought the presents at Christmas. You have been a good boy this year, haven’t you?"
3,8,STEVIE,"I have, I swear."
3,8,GRANDPA,"Well, then, who knows? Maybe he’ll come."
3,8,STEVIE,Santa! (whispered)
3,8,STEVIE,Reindeer! (whispered)
3,8,STEVIE,Santa?
3,8,WOMAN,"Um, my daughter and I were in our beds. Mike was downstairs decorating the tree. I heard a thump on the roof and then I heard Mike scream.  And now I’m talking to the FBI."
3,8,DEAN,And you didn't see any of it?
3,8,WOMAN,"No, he was… he was just gone."
3,8,DEAN,The doors were locked? There was no forced entry?
3,8,WOMAN,That’s right.
3,8,DEAN,Does anybody else have a key?
3,8,WOMAN,My parents.
3,8,DEAN,Where do they live?
3,8,WOMAN,Florida.
3,8,SAM,"Thanks for letting me have a look around, Mrs. Walsh. I think we, uh, got just about everything we need. We’re all set."
3,8,DEAN,We’ll be in touch.
3,8,MRS. WALSH,Agents…
3,8,MRS. WALSH,The police said my husband might have been kidnapped.
3,8,DEAN,Could be.
3,8,MRS. WALSH,Then why haven’t the kidnappers called? O-or – or demanded a ransom? It’s three days till Christmas. What am I supposed to tell our daughter?
3,8,SAM,We’re very sorry.
3,8,DEAN,Find anything?
3,8,SAM,"(Sighs) Stocking, mistletoe… this. (Gives DEAN something out of his pocket)"
3,8,DEAN,A tooth? Where was this? (Examines the tooth)
3,8,SAM,In the chimney.
3,8,DEAN,Chimney? No way a man fits up a chimney. It’s too narrow.
3,8,SAM,No way he fits up in one piece.
3,8,DEAN,"Alright, so, if dad went up the chimney—"
3,8,SAM,We need to find out what dragged him up there.
3,8,DEAN,"So, was I right? Is it the serial-killing chimney sweep?"
3,8,SAM,"Yep. It's, uh, it’s actually Dick Van Dyke."
3,8,DEAN,Who?
3,8,DEAN,Who’s that?
3,8,SAM,Oh come on— never mind. (Waves his hand)
3,8,DEAN,"Well, it turns out that Walsh is the second guy in town grabbed out of his house this month."
3,8,SAM,Oh yeah?
3,8,DEAN,Yeah.
3,8,SAM,"The other guy get dragged up the chimney, too?"
3,8,DEAN,"Don’t know. Witnesses said they heard a thump on the roof. (He shrugs, SAM also shrugs) So, what the hell do you think we're dealing with?"
3,8,SAM,"Actually, I have an idea."
3,8,DEAN,Yeah?
3,8,SAM,"Uh, it's gonna sound crazy."
3,8,DEAN,What could you possibly say that sounds crazy to me?
3,8,SAM,Um… evil Santa. (Smiles)
3,8,DEAN,"(Pauses and then nods) Yeah, that’s crazy."
3,8,SAM,"Yeah… I mean, I’m just saying that there’s some version of the anti-Claus in every culture. (Shows DEAN some evil Santa pictures) You got Belsnickel, Krampus, Black Peter. (DEAN takes the pictures from SAM) Whatever you want to call it, there’s all sorts of lore."
3,8,DEAN,Saying what?
3,8,SAM,"Saying ... back in the day, Santa’s brother went rogue and now he shows up around Christmas time, but instead of bringing presents, he punishes the wicked."
3,8,DEAN,By hauling their ass up chimneys?
3,8,SAM,"For starters, yeah."
3,8,DEAN,"So, this is your theory, huh?  Santa’s shady brother?"
3,8,SAM,"Well, ah –  I’m just saying, that’s what the lore says."
3,8,DEAN,Santa doesn’t have a brother. There is no Santa.
3,8,SAM,"Yeah, I know. You’re the one who told me that in the first place, remember. (Looks at DEAN, who looks down, maybe feeling a little guilty.  SAM turns back to his computer and sighs) Yeah, you know what, I could be wrong. I ... (sighs again, shutting his laptop) gotta be wrong."
3,8,DEAN,"Maybe, maybe not."
3,8,SAM,What?
3,8,DEAN,I did a little digging. Turns out both victims visited the same place before they got snatched.
3,8,SAM,Where?
3,8,DEAN,"It does kind of lend credence to the theory, don’t it?"
3,8,SAM,"Yeah, but anti-Claus? Couldn’t be."
3,8,DEAN,"It’s a Christmas miracle. Hey, speaking of, we should have one this year."
3,8,SAM,Have one what?
3,8,DEAN,A Christmas.
3,8,SAM,"(Scoffs) No, thanks."
3,8,DEAN,"No, we’ll get a tree, a little Boston market, just like when we were little."
3,8,SAM,"Dean, those weren’t exactly Hallmark memories for me, you know."
3,8,DEAN,What are you talking about? We had some great Christmases.
3,8,SAM,Whose childhood are you talking about?
3,8,DEAN,"Oh, come on, Sam."
3,8,SAM,No!  Just… no.
3,8,DEAN,"(Surprised) All right, Grinch."
3,8,SAM,A present for Dad.
3,8,DEAN,"Yeah, right. Where’d you get the money? Steal it?"
3,8,SAM,No. Uncle Bobby gave it to me to give to him. Said it was real special.
3,8,DEAN,What is it?
3,8,SAM (sarcastically),A pony.
3,8,DEAN,(Scoffs) Very funny.
3,8,SAM,"Dad’s gonna be here, right?"
3,8,DEAN,He’ll be here.
3,8,SAM,It’s Christmas.
3,8,DEAN,He knows and he’ll be here. Promise.
3,8,SAM,Where is he anyway?
3,8,DEAN,On business.
3,8,SAM,What kind of business?
3,8,DEAN,You know that. He sells stuff.
3,8,SAM,What kind of stuff?
3,8,DEAN,Stuff.
3,8,SAM,Nobody ever tells me anything.
3,8,DEAN,(Rolls his eyes) Then quit asking.
3,8,SAM,Is Dad a spy?
3,8,DEAN,Mm-hmm. He’s James Bond.
3,8,SAM,Why do we move around so much?
3,8,DEAN,"’Cause everywhere we go, they get sick of your face."
3,8,SAM,"I’m old enough, Dean. You can tell me the truth."
3,8,DEAN,You don’t wanna know the truth. Believe me.
3,8,SAM,Is that why we never talk about… Mom?
3,8,DEAN,(Tosses the magazine away angrily and stands up)  Shut up!  Don’t you ever talk about Mom. Ever! (Heads for the door)
3,8,SAM,"Wait, where are you going?"
3,8,DEAN,Out.
3,8,DEAN,"You’d think with the 10 bucks it costs to get into this place, Santa could scrounge up a little snow."
3,8,SAM,(Awakening from his daydreaming) What?
3,8,DEAN,"Nothing. What are we looking for, again?"
3,8,SAM,Um… (Looks around) lore says that the anti-Claus will walk with a limp and smell like sweets.
3,8,DEAN,Great. So we’re looking for a pimp Santa. Why the sweets?
3,8,SAM,"Think about it, Dean. If you smell like candy, the kids will come closer, you know?"
3,8,DEAN,That’s creepy. (SAM chuckles) How does this thing know who’s been naughty and who’s been nice?
3,8,SAM,I don’t know.
3,8,SANTA,"So, Ronny, come sit on Santa’s knee. (The boy sits) Ah, there you go. You been a good boy this year?"
3,8,BOY,Yeah.
3,8,SANTA,Good. Santa’s got a special gift for you.  (cackles creepily)
3,8,DEAN,(Looks at Santa and the boy speculatively) Maybe we do.
3,8,RONNY’S MOTHER,"Come on, honey, let’s go."
3,8,ELFIN,Welcome to Santa’s court. Can I escort your child to Santa?
3,8,SAM,Uh…
3,8,DEAN,"No. No. Uh, but actually my brother here (smacks SAM on the shoulder) … it's been a lifelong dream of his."
3,8,ELFIN,"(Looks at SAM like he’s a freak) Uh, sorry. No kids over… 12."
3,8,SAM,"No, he’s just kidding. We only came here to watch."
3,8,ELFIN,Eww.
3,8,SAM,"I-I didn’t mean that we came here to w— Y— (DEAN looks at SAM) Thanks a lot, Dean. Thanks for that."
3,8,DEAN,(Laughs and suddenly turns serious) Check it out.
3,8,DEAN,Are you seeing this?
3,8,SAM,"A lot of people walk with limps, right?"
3,8,DEAN,"Tell me you didn’t smell that. That was candy, man."
3,8,SAM,That was Ripple.   I think.  Had to be.  (He looks at Santa again.)
3,8,DEAN,Maybe. We’re willing to take that chance?
3,8,DEAN,What time is it?
3,8,SAM,Same as the last time you asked. Here… (Hands DEAN a thermos) Caffeinate.
3,8,DEAN,"Wonderful. (Suddenly he scoffs) Hey, Sam."
3,8,SAM,Yeah?
3,8,DEAN,Why are you the boy that hates Christmas?
3,8,SAM,Dean ...
3,8,DEAN,"I mean, I admit it. You know, we had a few bumpy holidays when we were kids."
3,8,SAM,“Bumpy”?
3,8,DEAN,That was then.  We’ll do it right this year.
3,8,SAM,"Look, Dean. If you want to have Christmas, knock yourself out. Just don’t involve me."
3,8,DEAN,"(Looks at SAM in disbelief)  Oh, yeah, that’d be great. Me and myself making cranberry molds."
3,8,DEAN,What’s up with Saint Nicotine?
3,8,WOMAN’S VOICE,"Oh, my God!"
3,8,SAM,Huh.
3,8,DEAN,What?
3,8,SAM,"Nothing. It’s just that, uh… well, you know, Mr. Gung Ho Christmas might have to blow away Santa."
3,8,SANTA,What the hell are you doing here?
3,8,SAM,"Ah, w—"
3,8,DEAN,"(Starts to sing – badly) S-silent night… Holy… (He looks at SAM, who follows him, shrugging, and smiling)"
3,8,SANTA,(Also singing along) …all is dry.
3,8,SAM,Bright…
3,8,SAM,The table… (Puts a hand on DEAN’s shoulder to pull him away)
3,8,BOY,"Santa, you’re early."
3,8,DEAN,"So, that’s how your son described the attack? “Santa took daddy up the chimney”?"
3,8,DEAN,And where were you?
3,8,WOMAN,"I was asleep and all of a sudden (sniffs) … I was being dragged out of bed, screaming."
3,8,SAM,Did you see the attacker?
3,8,WOMAN,"(Shakes her head) It was dark, and he hit me. He knocked me out."
3,8,DEAN,(Nods) I’m sorry. I know this is hard.
3,8,SAM,"Yeah… um, Mrs.  Caldwell, where, where did you get that wreath above the fireplace? (DEAN looks around at the wreath, and blinks, a little puzzled.)"
3,8,MRS CALDWELL,Excuse me?
3,8,DEAN,"Wreaths, huh? Sure you didn’t want to ask her about her shoes? I saw some nice handbags in the foyer."
3,8,SAM,"We’ve seen that wreath before, Dean."
3,8,DEAN,Where?
3,8,SAM,The Walshes’. Yesterday.
3,8,DEAN,I know. I was just testing you.
3,8,SAM,"Yeah, all right. Well, keep looking, would you? Thanks, Bobby. (He hangs up) Well… we’re not dealing with the anti-Claus."
3,8,DEAN,What did Bobby say?
3,8,SAM,"Uh, that we're morons. He also said that it was probably meadowsweet in those wreaths.  (Looks at his laptop.)"
3,8,DEAN,Wow! Amazing. What the hell is meadowsweet?
3,8,SAM,It’s pretty rare and it’s probably the most powerful plant in pagan lore.
3,8,DEAN,Pagan lore?
3,8,SAM,"Yeah. See, they used meadowsweet for human sacrifice. It was kind of like a… Chum for their gods. Gods were drawn to it and they’d stop by and snack on whatever was the nearest human."
3,8,DEAN,Why would somebody be using that for Christmas wreaths?
3,8,SAM,"It's not as crazy as it sounds, Dean. I mean, pretty much every Christmas tradition is pagan."
3,8,DEAN,Christmas is Jesus’s birthday.
3,8,SAM,"No, Jesus’s birthday was probably in the fall. It was actually the winter solstice festival that was co-opted by the Church and renamed “Christmas”. But I mean, the Yule log, the tree, even Santa’s red suit – that’s all remnants of pagan worship."
3,8,DEAN,How do you know that? What are you gonna tell me next? Easter bunny’s Jewish? (SAM says nothing) So you think we’re gonna dealing with a pagan God?
3,8,SAM,"Yeah, probably Hold Nickar, God of the winter solstice."
3,8,DEAN,"And all these Martha Stewart wannabes, buying these fancy wreaths…"
3,8,SAM,"Yeah, it’s pretty much like putting a neon sign on your front door saying “Come kill us”."
3,8,DEAN,Great.
3,8,SAM,"(Reading an article on the laptop) Huh… When you sacrifice to Hold Nickar, guess what he gives you in return."
3,8,DEAN,"Lap dances, hopefully."
3,8,SAM,Mild weather.
3,8,DEAN,(Looks out the window) Like no snow in the middle of December in the middle of Michigan.
3,8,SAM,For instance.
3,8,DEAN,Do we know how to kill it yet?
3,8,SAM,"No, Bobby’s working on that right now. We got to figure out where they’re selling those wreaths."
3,8,DEAN,You think they’re selling them on purpose? Feeding the victims to this thing?
3,8,SAM,(exhales) Let’s find out.
3,8,SHOPKEEPER,"Help you, boys?"
3,8,DEAN,"Uh, hope so. Uh, we were playing Jenga over at the Walshes’ the other night, and, uh… well, he hasn’t shut up since about this Christmas wreath, and (to SAM) I don’t know, you tell him."
3,8,SAM,(Giving DEAN a look) Sure. (turns back to the shopkeeper) It was yummy.
3,8,SHOPKEEPER,"I sell a lot of wreaths, guys."
3,8,SAM,"Right, right, but – but you see, this one would have been really special. It had, uh, it had, uh, green leaves, um, white buds on it. It might have been made of, uh… meadowsweet?"
3,8,SHOPKEEPER,"Well, aren’t you a fussy one?"
3,8,DEAN,"(Smiles) He is… (He laughs and SAM looks at him, annoyed)"
3,8,SHOPKEEPER,"Anyway, I know the one you’re talking about. I’m all out."
3,8,DEAN,Huh. Seems like this meadowsweet stuff’s pretty rare and expensive. Why make wreaths out of it?
3,8,SHOPKEEPER,Beats me. I didn't make them.
3,8,DEAN,Who did?
3,8,SHOPKEEPER,"Madge Carrigan, a local lady. She said the wreaths were so special, she gave them to me for free."
3,8,SAM,She didn’t charge you?
3,8,SHOPKEEPER,Nope.
3,8,DEAN,Did you sell them for free?
3,8,SHOPKEEPER,Hell no. It’s Christmas. People pay a buttload for this crap.
3,8,DEAN,That’s the spirit.
3,8,DEAN,How much do you think a meadowsweet wreath would cost?
3,8,SAM,"A couple hundred dollars, at least."
3,8,DEAN,This lady’s giving them away for free? What do you think about that?
3,8,SAM,"Well, sounds pretty suspicious."
3,8,DEAN,Remember that wreath Dad brought home that one year?
3,8,SAM,"You mean the one he stole from, like, a liquor store?"
3,8,DEAN,"Yeah, it was a bunch of empty beer cans. That thing was great. I bet if I looked around hard enough, I could probably find one just like it."
3,8,SAM,All right. Dude… What’s going on with you?
3,8,DEAN,What?
3,8,SAM,"I mean, since when are you Bing Crosby all of a sudden? Why do you want Christmas so bad?"
3,8,DEAN,"Why are you so against it? I mean, were your childhood memories that traumatic?"
3,8,SAM,"No, that has nothing to do with it."
3,8,DEAN,Then what?
3,8,SAM,"I-I mean, I-I just… I don’t get it. You haven’t talked about Christmas in years."
3,8,DEAN,"Well, yeah. This is my last year."
3,8,SAM,"(Pause, small sigh) I know.  That’s why I can’t."
3,8,DEAN,What do you mean?
3,8,SAM,Thought you went out.
3,8,DEAN,"Yeah, to get you dinner. (Tosses SAM packaged food) Don’t forget your vegetables. (Tosses him another bag of snack food, Funyuns)"
3,8,SAM,I know why you keep a gun under your pillow.
3,8,DEAN,"(Lifts his pillow and sees his gun) No, you don’t. Stay out of my stuff."
3,8,SAM,And I know why we lay salt down everywhere we go.
3,8,DEAN,"No, you don’t. Shut up."
3,8,DEAN,(Stands up) Where’d you get that? That’s Dad’s! He’s gonna kick your ass for reading that.
3,8,SAM,Are monsters real?
3,8,DEAN,What? You’re crazy.
3,8,SAM,Tell me.
3,8,DEAN,"(Looks away, hesitates) I swear, if you ever tell Dad I told you any of this, I will end you."
3,8,SAM,Promise.
3,8,DEAN,"(Sits and looks at JOHN’s diary) Well, the first thing you have to know is we have the coolest dad in the world. He’s a superhero."
3,8,SAM,He is?
3,8,DEAN,Yeah. Monsters are real. Dad fights them. He’s fighting them right now.
3,8,SAM,But Dad said the monsters under my bed weren’t real.
3,8,DEAN,"That’s ’cause he had already checked under there. But yeah, they’re real. Almost everything’s real."
3,8,SAM,Is Santa real?
3,8,DEAN,"(Smiles, shakes his head) No."
3,8,SAM,"(Pauses, looks sad) If monsters are real, then they could get us. They could get me."
3,8,DEAN,Dad’s not gonna let them get you.
3,8,SAM,But what if they get him?
3,8,DEAN,"They aren’t gonna get Dad. Dad’s, like, the best."
3,8,SAM,I read in Dad’s book that they got Mom.
3,8,DEAN,"(Exhales) It’s complicated, Sam."
3,8,SAM,"If they got Mom, they can get Dad ,and if they get Dad, they can get us."
3,8,DEAN,It’s not like that. (Moves and sits next to SAM)  Okay? Dad’s fine. We’re fine. Trust me. (SAM looks sad and worried.) You okay?
3,8,SAM,Yeah. (Looks away)
3,8,DEAN,"Hey, Dad’s gonna be here for Christmas. Just like he always is."
3,8,SAM,"(Holds back tears) I just want to go to sleep, okay?"
3,8,DEAN,"Yeah, okay."
3,8,DEAN,It’ll all be better when you wake up. (SAM cries harder.) You’ll see. Promise.
3,8,DEAN,"This is where Mrs. Wreath lives, huh? Can’t you just feel the evil pagan vibe?"
3,8,MADGE,Yes?
3,8,DEAN,Please tell me you’re the Madge Carrigan who makes the meadowsweet wreaths.
3,8,MADGE,"Why, yes I am."
3,8,SAM,"Yeah? Uh, well, we were just admiring your wreaths in Mr. Sylar’s place the other day?"
3,8,MADGE,"You were? Well, isn't that meadowsweet just the finest-smelling thing you ever smelled?"
3,8,SAM,"It is, it sure is. But the problem is, is that all you wreaths had sold out before we got the chance to buy one."
3,8,MADGE,"Oh, fudge!"
3,8,DEAN,"You wouldn’t have another one that we could buy from you, would you?"
3,8,MADGE,"Oh, no, I’m afraid those were the only ones I had for this season."
3,8,SAM,Aww…
3,8,DEAN,"Tell me something, why did you decide to make them out of meadowsweet?"
3,8,MADGE,"Why, the smell, of course! I don’t think I’ve ever smelled anything finer."
3,8,SAM,"Yeah… um, you mentioned that."
3,8,MR. CARRIGAN,"What's going on, honey?"
3,8,MADGE,"Well, just some nice boys asking about my wreaths, dear."
3,8,MR. CARRIGAN,"Oh, the wreaths are fine. Fine wreaths. Oh, care for some peanut brittle? (He offers them peanut brittle)"
3,8,SAM,We’re okay.
3,8,SAM,(Claps his hands) I knew it!  Something was way off with those two.
3,8,DEAN,What’d you find?
3,8,SAM,"The Carrigans lived in Seattle, last year, where two abductions took place right around Christmas. They moved here in January.  All that Christmas crap in their house – that wasn’t boughs of holly. It was vervain and mint."
3,8,DEAN,Pagan stuff?
3,8,SAM,Serious pagan stuff.
3,8,DEAN,"So what, Ozzie and Harriet are keeping a pagan god hidden underneath their plastic-covered couch?"
3,8,SAM,"I don’t know. All I know is we gotta check them out. So, what about Bobby? He’s sure evergreen stakes will kill this thing, right?"
3,8,DEAN,"(Looks at the stake) Yeah, he’s sure."
3,8,DEAN,"(Looks at the couch that still covered with plastic, whispers) See? Plastic.  (SAM touches it too as DEAN shakes his head disapprovingly.)"
3,8,SAM,"Hey, Dean."
3,8,CUT TO,
3,8,DEAN,Sam!
3,8,MADGE,"Gosh, I wish you boys hadn’t come down here."
3,8,SAM,Dean? You okay?
3,8,DEAN,"Yeah, I think so."
3,8,SAM,"(Sighs) So, I guess we’re dealing with Mr. and Mrs. God. (DEAN nods) Nice to know."
3,8,DEAN,Yeah.
3,8,MADGE,"Ooh, and here we thought you two lazybones were gonna sleep straight through all the fun stuff. (Giggles)"
3,8,DEAN,"Miss all this? Nah, we’re partiers."
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,"(Smokes his pipe) Isn’t he a kick in the pants, honey? You’re hunters, is what you are."
3,8,DEAN,"And you’re pagan gods. So, why don't we just call it even, and go our separate ways?"
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,"What, so you can bring more hunters and kill us? (Laughs) I don’t think so."
3,8,SAM,"Maybe you should have thought about that before you went snacking on humans, now, huh?"
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,"Oh now, don’t get all wet."
3,8,MADGE,"Oh, why, we used to take over a hundred tributes a year and that’s a fact. (Put a napkin on DEAN’s lap). Now what do we take? What, two? Three? (And put another napkin on SAM’s lap)"
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,Hardy Boys here make five.
3,8,MADGE,"Now, that’s not so bad, is it?"
3,8,DEAN,"Well, you say it like that – I guess you guys are the Cunninghams."
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,"You, mister, better show us a little respect."
3,8,SAM,Or what? You’ll eat us?
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,Not so fast. (Looks at MADGE who looks excited) There’s rituals to be followed first.
3,8,MADGE,"Oh, we’re just sticklers for ritual."
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,And you know what kicks off the whole shebang? (MADGE smiles)
3,8,DEAN,Let me guess… meadowsweet.
3,8,MADGE,Oh!
3,8,DEAN,"Oh shucks, you’re all out of wreaths. I guess we’ll just have to cancel the sacrifice, huh?"
3,8,MADGE,"Oh, don’t be such a gloomy Gus. (Put wreaths around DEAN’s and SAM’s necks) There. Ohh… Don’t they just look darling?"
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,Good enough to eat. (Smacks his lips) All righty-roo. (whips out a knife with a shhing) Step number two.
3,8,DEAN,Sammy?! Sammy?!
3,8,SAM,D-Don’t! (Screams)
3,8,DEAN,"Leave him alone, you son of a bitch!"
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,"Hear how they talk to us?  Heh heh.  To Gods? (MADGE takes the knife and bowl) Listen, pal, back in the day, we were worshiped by millions."
3,8,DEAN,Time have changed!
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,"Tell me about it. All of a sudden, this Jesus character is the hot new thing in town. All of a sudden, our – our altars are being burned down, and we’re being hunted down like common monsters."
3,8,MADGE,"But did we say a peep? Oh ho ho, no, no, no, we did not. (MR CARRIGAN adds something to SAM’s blood in the bowl) Two millennium. (MR CARRIGAN picks up a tool) We kept a low profile; we got jobs, a mortgage. Wh-What was that word, dear?"
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,We assimilated.
3,8,MADGE,"Yeah, we assimilated. Why, we play bridge on Tuesday and Fridays. (Holding a large knife) We’re just like everybody else."
3,8,DEAN,"You’re not blending in as smooth as you think, lady."
3,8,MADGE,"This might pinch a bit, dear."
3,8,DEAN,(Screams) You bitch!
3,8,MADGE,"Oh, my goodness me! Somebody owes a nickel to the swear jar. Oh, do you know what I say when I feel like swearing? (DEAN looks MADGE in the eyes, as she gestures with her sharp knife in cheesy emphasis) “Fudge.”"
3,8,DEAN,(panting) I’ll try and remember that!
3,8,SAM,(Panicked) What do you think you’re doing with those?
3,8,DEAN,(Looks at MADGE) You fudging touch me again and I’ll fudging kill you!
3,8,MADGE,Very good!
3,8,SAM,No.  No.  Don’t.
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,"(Holds up the nail) Oh, we got a winner!"
3,8,MADGE,"What else, dear?"
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,"Well, let’s see. Uh, fingernail, blood. Oh… (Hit his own head) sweet Peter on a popsicle stick… (laughs) I forgot the tooth."
3,8,MADGE,"Oh, dear!"
3,8,DEAN,"(breathing hard) Merry Christmas, Sam. (SAM groans)"
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,"Open wide… and say, “Aaah.”"
3,8,DEAN,(With the pliers in his mouth) Somebody gonna get that? (MADGE and MR CARRIGAN look each other. SAM looks relieved) You should get that.
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,(Rolls his eyes and sighs) Come on.
3,8,CUT TO,
3,8,NEIGHBOR,Merry Christmas! (Gives MADGE fruitcake)
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,I told you I smelled fruitcake!
3,8,MADGE,(Look grateful) You shouldn’t have.
3,8,NEIGHBOR,"Oh, bite your tongue, it’s my pleasure."
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,It looks scrumptious!
3,8,NEIGHBOR,"Say, Neal and I are going caroling. You care to join?"
3,8,MADGE,You know we would—
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,It’s my back. Darn thing’s giving me fits.
3,8,NEIGHBOR,"Oh, well, that’s a shame. Oh well, Merry Christmas."
3,8,MADGE,"And to you too, dear."
3,8,NEIGHBOR,"Hey, are we still on for bridge tomorrow?"
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,With bells on!
3,8,NEIGHBOR,"Yes! Okay, bye!"
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,Bye-bye.
3,8,CUT TO,
3,8,MADGE,"Now, where were we?"
3,8,DEAN,(Leaning one hand against the door) What do we do now? The evergreen stakes are in the basement!
3,8,SAM,"Well, we need more evergreen, Dean! (Looks at the Christmas tree) I think I just found us some more.  (Looks at large cabinet next to the door) Help me get this."
3,8,MADGE,You little thing. (Her face momentarily distorts) I loved that tree.
3,8,MR CARRIGAN,(Looks at his wife and screams) Madge!!!
3,8,SAM,"Merry Christmas. (Looks at DEAN, smiles briefly and sighs)"
3,8,DEAN,"Sam, wake up! (SAM wakes) Dad was here. Look what he brought."
3,8,SAM,Dad was here?
3,8,DEAN,Yeah. Look at this.  We made a killing.
3,8,SAM,(Yawns) Why didn't he try to wake me up?
3,8,DEAN,"He tried to, like a thousand times."
3,8,SAM,He did?
3,8,DEAN,"(Nods) Yeah. Did I tell you he would give us Christmas, or what? (SAM looks around) Go on, dive in."
3,8,DEAN,(Smiles) What is it?
3,8,SAM,Sapphire Barbie.
3,8,DEAN,(Chuckles) Dad probably thinks you’re a girl.
3,8,SAM,Shut up! (Throws the Barbie onto the ground)
3,8,DEAN,Open that one.
3,8,SAM,"Dad never showed, did he?"
3,8,DEAN,"Yeah, he did, I swear."
3,8,SAM,Dean…. Where’d you get all this stuff?
3,8,DEAN,"(sighs) Nice house up the block. (SAM looks away) I swear I didn’t know they were chick presents. (SAM nods) Look, I’m sure Dad would have been here if he could."
3,8,SAM,If he’s alive.
3,8,DEAN,Don’t say that. Of course he’s alive. He’s Dad.
3,8,SAM,"Here, take this."
3,8,DEAN,"No. No, that’s for Dad."
3,8,SAM,Dad lied to me. I want you to have it.
3,8,DEAN,You sure?
3,8,SAM,(Nods) I’m sure.
3,8,DEAN,"Thank you, Sam. I–I love it."
3,8,DEAN,Hey! You get the beer? (Holding a cup of eggnog)
3,8,DEAN,(Looks kind of amazed) What’s all this? (Looks at the decorations in the room)
3,8,SAM,What do you think it is? It’s – it’s Christmas.
3,8,DEAN,What made you change your mind?
3,8,SAM,"(Doesn’t answer) Here, uh ... try the eggnog. (Gives him a cup) Let me know if it needs some more kick. (He holds out a bottle of whiskey)"
3,8,DEAN,"No, we’re good."
3,8,SAM,(Happy) Yeah?
3,8,DEAN,(Smiling) Yeah.
3,8,SAM,"Good. Well, uh, have a seat. Let’s do… Christmas stuff, or whatever."
3,8,DEAN,"(Nods, happy) All right, first things first. (SAM sits on the couch and DEAN pulls up a chair. He takes two packages wrapped in brown paper from a plastic bag and holds them out to SAM) Merry Christmas, Sam."
3,8,SAM,"(smiling, takes the gifts) Where’d you get these?"
3,8,DEAN,Someplace special. (SAM looks at him) The gas mart down the street (SAM laughs) Open them up.
3,8,SAM,"Well, great minds think alike, Dean. (SAM reaches under the couch for two packages wrapped in newspaper, which he gives to DEAN)"
3,8,DEAN,(Surprised) Really? (Takes the gifts)
3,8,SAM,There you go.
3,8,DEAN,Come on.
3,8,SAM,"(Laughs) Skin mags! (DEAN nods, satisfied with SAM’s reaction) and… (opens the other gift) Shaving cream."
3,8,DEAN,You like?
3,8,SAM,(Smiles) Yeah. Yeah. (Nods)
3,8,DEAN,"Look at this. (He lifts his presents, it’s a candy bar and a bottle of oil) Fuel for me and fuel for my baby. (SAM nods) These are awesome. Tthanks."
3,8,SAM,Good. (Suddenly there’s a bit of sadness in his face)
3,8,DEAN,"(Lifts his glass of eggnog) Merry Christmas, bro."
3,8,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah.  (Lift his eggnog and makes a toast with DEAN’s glass) Here, Merry Christmas."
3,8,SAM,"Hey, Dean, y–. (SAM looks sad and about to say something, but he hesitates, then sighs and looks at DEAN again) Do you feel like watching the game?"
3,8,DEAN,(Smiles in relief) Absolutely.
3,8,SAM,(Nods) All right.
3,9,PAUL,"She was so scared. I couldn't help; I couldn't do anything to stop it. And I've talked to the police, and I've talked to the medical examiner and no one can explain it."
3,9,DEAN,"Well, that's why they put the call in to us Mr. Dutton."
3,9,PAUL,"But the CDC, that's disease control, right? What do you think; it's some kind of virus?"
3,9,DEAN (V.O.),We're not ruling out anything yet. Mr. Dutton did Janet have any enemies?
3,9,PAUL (V.O.),I'm sorry?
3,9,DEAN,Anyone that might have a reason to hurt her?
3,9,PAUL,"Wait, what are you saying? That somebody poisoned her?"
3,9,DEAN (V.O.),I'm just saying we have to cover every base here.
3,9,PAUL (V.O),"Well, I mean, what kind of poison? You think a person could have done this?"
3,9,DEAN (V.O.),Would anyone want to?
3,9,PAUL,"What?! No, no, there's just no one that could've—"
3,9,DEAN,Mr. Dutton?
3,9,PAUL,"Uh, everyone loved Janet."
3,9,DEAN,Okay. Thank you very much; I think we've got everything we need. We'll get out of your way now.
3,9,SAM,"No it could be anyone. Neighbor, coworker, man, woman—that's the problem, Dean, they're human, they're like everyone else."
3,9,DEAN,Great. How do we find 'em?
3,9,SAM,This wasn't random; someone in Janet Dutton's life had an ugly axe to grind. We find the motive—
3,9,DEAN,We find the murderer.
3,9,SAM,Yeah.
3,9,ELIZABETH,Amanda.
3,9,ELIZABETH,Hey Amanda!
3,9,AMANDA,"Oh, Elizabeth hi. Sorry, I've got like a thousand things on my mind."
3,9,ELIZABETH,Are you okay sweetie? You didn't come to book club last night.
3,9,AMANDA,"Yeah, sorry I was gonna call, I just—I got busy, you know? But I'm fine, really, I am."
3,9,PAUL,There's a woman—uh—
3,9,DEAN,"A woman, okay?"
3,9,DEAN,Paul! What is her name?
3,9,AMANDA,No! No...aah no!
3,9,SAM,Yeah.
3,9,DEAN,"Three per wrist, vertical. She wasn't foolin' around."
3,9,SAM,"Yeah, looks like she was working some heavyweight evil here."
3,9,DEAN,Yep.
3,9,DEAN,"Oh god! Freakin' witches! Seriously man, come on!"
3,9,SAM,Guess we know where she got the rabbit's teeth from.
3,9,DEAN,"Well, Paul sure knows how to pick 'em huh? It's like Fatal Attraction all over again."
3,9,SAM,Yeah.
3,9,DEAN,And why does the rabbit always get screwed in the deal?! The poor little guy.
3,9,SAM,"You know what I don't get, Dean? If she was so bent on revenge, why do this?"
3,9,DEAN,"Well, she got Janet Dutton, thought she finished off Paul, decided to cap herself and make it a spurned lover's hat-trick."
3,9,SAM,Maybe.
3,9,DEAN,"I mean, this doesn't exactly look like the TV room of a bright and stable person, you know?"
3,9,SAM,"No, but then..."
3,9,SAM,There's this.
3,9,DEAN,Another hex bag? Come on!
3,9,DEAN,"Looks like we got a hit, huh? A little witch-on-witch violence?"
3,9,SAM,I guess.
3,9,DEAN,"I'd like to report a dead body, 309 Mayfair Circle. My name? Yeah, sure my name is—"
3,9,DEAN,Why are witches ganking each other?
3,9,SAM,"I don't know, but I think maybe we got a coven on our hands."
3,9,RON,"All right, all right.  I'm going. I'm not fooled by your little book club by the way. I know what you ladies get up to when I'm gone. It's all dish and gossip."
3,9,ELIZABETH,Hi Ron.
3,9,ELIZABETH,He doesn't know? You didn't tell him?
3,9,RENEE,"About Amanda? Oh, I think that's book club business, don't you?"
3,9,RENEE,"Amanda killed herself yes. And yes, she killed Janet. (tsk-tsk clicks her teeth) Awful, awful business of course, but that's all over now. And think about what Book Club has gotten us hmm? Your husband's promotion, that little trip to Hawaii that you won. And what about me? My home pottery business is finally taking off and you wanna just stop? Do you wanna stop?"
3,9,RENEE,"'kay, now come on, we don't have much time, Ron gets back from his Fantasy Football in an hour."
3,9,SAM,You must have a green thumb.
3,9,SAM,"I'm uh, Detective Bachman, this is Detective Turner."
3,9,DEAN,Hi-ya.
3,9,SAM,"We're following up on Amanda Burns' death, going around the neighborhood and talking to neighbors and stuff like that."
3,9,ELIZABETH,But didn't she— I mean she killed herself right?
3,9,SAM,"Maybe, maybe."
3,9,DEAN,We heard you were friends with the deceased right?
3,9,ELIZABETH,"Yeah, I guess so."
3,9,DEAN,Did you have any idea about her practices?
3,9,ELIZABETH,"I'm sorry, what kind of practices?"
3,9,SAM,"Well see, her house was littered with Satanic paraphernalia."
3,9,DEAN,A regular Black Sabbath.
3,9,ELIZABETH,"No, the— but she was an Episcopalian."
3,9,DEAN,"Well, then we're pretty sure she was using the wrong Bible. (chuckles)"
3,9,RENEE,"Elizabeth, you all right?"
3,9,ELIZABETH,"I'm fine uh Renee, these are detectives. They say Amanda was— she was practicing—"
3,9,RENEE,I'm sorry detectives; you can tell that Elizabeth is a little bit upset.
3,9,DEAN,"Of course, Miss ... ?"
3,9,RENEE,"Missus.  Renee.  Van Allen. (She says it slowly and emphatically, like it's significant and she's important.) Would you like me to spell it for you?"
3,9,DEAN,"I'll get by, thanks."
3,9,RENEE,This Amanda business has been hard for Liz. For all of us.
3,9,TAMMI,"Yeah.  I mean, you think you know a person."
3,9,DEAN,"Well, I guess we all have secrets don't we?"
3,9,SAM,"Well, thanks, um, we'll be in touch."
3,9,DEAN,"Well, I'm already sold on that Elizabeth chick.  Did you see that victory garden of hers? Belladonna, wolfsbane, mandrake, not to mention that little flinch she threw when we mentioned the occult."
3,9,SAM,"Well, she's definitely had a good run lately, gone up a few tax brackets; won almost too many raffles. Kinda thing a little black magic always helps with."
3,9,DEAN,Yeah.
3,9,SAM,I don't think she's alone either.  Looks like 'MRS. Renee Van Allen' has won almost every craft contest she has entered in the past three months.
3,9,DEAN,"Yeah, a regular Martha Stewart, huh? Except for the devil worship, I'm thinking that was the coven we met back there, minus one member."
3,9,SAM,"Amanda was clearly going off the reservation. What do you think, they killed her to keep up appearances?"
3,9,DEAN,"Seems like an appearance kind of crowd, don't you think?"
3,9,SAM,Yeah.
3,9,DEAN,"If they killed the nut-job, should we uh, thank them or what?"
3,9,SAM,"They're working black magic too, Dean. They need to be stopped."
3,9,DEAN,'Stopped' like stopped?
3,9,DEAN,"They're human, Sam."
3,9,SAM,They're murderers.
3,9,DEAN,"Burn witch, burn."
3,9,DEAN,What the hell?
3,9,SAM,Ruby.
3,9,RUBY,"Sam, listen to me, there's no time."
3,9,SAM,For what? What are you talking about?
3,9,RUBY,You have to get out of town.
3,9,DEAN,"So this is Ruby, huh?"
3,9,DEAN,Never had the pleasure.
3,9,SAM,Dean!
3,9,DEAN,I was hoping you'd show up again.
3,9,RUBY,Point that thing somewhere else.
3,9,DEAN,Hahahaha! Right.
3,9,RUBY,"Sam, please. Go.  Get in the car and don't look back."
3,9,SAM,Why? I don't understand.
3,9,DEAN,"Hey, hot stuff, we can take care of a few kitchen witches, thanks."
3,9,RUBY,"I'm not talking about witches, you jackass.  Witches are whores. I'm talking about who they serve."
3,9,SAM,Demons.  They get their power from demons.
3,9,RUBY,"Yeah.  And there's one here, now."
3,9,DEAN,"Oh, what, you mean besides you?"
3,9,RUBY,"Sam, it knows you're in town and it's gonna come after you and its way more than you can handle."
3,9,DEAN,"Oh come on, what is this, huh? Please tell me you're not listening to this crap!"
3,9,RUBY,"Put a leash on your brother, Sam, if you wanna keep him."
3,9,SAM,"Dean, look, just chill out."
3,9,DEAN,"No! No! She's messing with your head, God knows why, that's who they are!"
3,9,RUBY,I'm telling you the truth.
3,9,DEAN,"And I'm telling you to shut up, bitch."
3,9,RUBY,"I'm sorry, why are you even a part of this conversation?!"
3,9,DEAN,"Oh, I don't know maybe because he's my brother, you black-eyed skank!"
3,9,RUBY,"Oh, right, right. You care about your brother so much.  That's why you're checking out in a few months, leaving him all alone?"
3,9,DEAN,Shut up.
3,9,RUBY,"At least let me try and save him, since you won't be here to do it any more."
3,9,DEAN,I said shut up!
3,9,SAM,Dean no!
3,9,DEAN,What the hell were you thinking?
3,9,DEAN,"She's a demon, Sam. Period.  All right? They want us dead, we want them dead."
3,9,SAM,"Oh, that's funny; I remember that demon chick in Ohio, Casey? You didn't want her dead."
3,9,DEAN,"Yeah, well she wasn't stringing me along like a fish on a hook."
3,9,SAM,Kill her with what? The gun she fixed for us?
3,9,DEAN,Whatever works.
3,9,SAM,"Dean, if she wants us dead, all she has to do is stop saving our lives."
3,9,SAM,"Look, we have to start looking at the big picture Dean, start thinking in strategies and – and moves ahead."
3,9,SAM,"It's not so simple, we're not – we're not just hunting anymore.  We're at war."
3,9,DEAN,Are you feeling okay?
3,9,SAM,(sigh) Why are you always asking me that?
3,9,DEAN,"Because you're taking advice from a demon, for starters. And by the way, you seem less and less worried about offing people.  You know, it used to eat you up inside."
3,9,SAM,"Yeah, and what has that gotten me?"
3,9,DEAN,"Nothing, but it's just what you're supposed to do, okay? We're supposed to drive in the freakin' car and freakin' argue about this stuff. You know, you go on about the sanctity of life and all that crap.  (DEAN rubs his stomach uncomfortably.)"
3,9,SAM,"Wait, so – so you're mad because I'm starting to agree with you?  (DEAN looks at SAM and exhales.)"
3,9,DEAN,"No, I'm not mad, I'm— I'm— I'm worried, Sam— (DEAN moves and sits down on the foot of the other bed in the room.)  I'm worried because you're not acting like yourself."
3,9,SAM,"Yeah, you're right, I'm not. I don't have a choice."
3,9,DEAN,What is that supposed to mean?
3,9,SAM,"Look, Dean, you're leaving – right? And I gotta stay here in this craphole of a world. Alone. So the way I see it, if I'm gonna make it, if I'm gonna fight this war after you're gone, then I gotta change."
3,9,DEAN,Change into what?
3,9,SAM,Into you. I gotta be more like you.
3,9,DEAN,Ah!
3,9,SAM,What's going on with you?
3,9,DEAN,"I don't know. (bends, gasps) Oh— Sam something's wrong— bunch of knives inside of me—"
3,9,SAM,Dean?
3,9,DEAN,Son of a bitch—
3,9,SAM,"Dean, hey."
3,9,DEAN,"The coven man, it's gotta be the coven."
3,9,SAM,Don't worry.
3,9,SAM,"Dean, I can't find it."
3,9,SAM,No.
3,9,DEAN,"Sam, what are you doing?"
3,9,DEAN,Sam!
3,9,DEAN,Sam!
3,9,SAM,Let him go.
3,9,RENEE,"Let who go? What are you doing? You're insane, get out!"
3,9,SAM,"Look, if you know about me, then you know about this gun. You're killing my brother.  Now let him go. Get away from the altar."
3,9,RENEE,What?
3,9,SAM,Now!
3,9,DEAN,You wanna kill me? Get in line bitch.
3,9,RUBY (panting),Stop ... calling me bitch.
3,9,SAM,Go.
3,9,ELIZABETH,What— we— we weren't hurting anyone.
3,9,RENEE,"Please, we don't even know your brother."
3,9,SAM,"Stop the spell, or die.  Five seconds."
3,9,RENEE,What?
3,9,SAM,Four.
3,9,RENEE,"No, please, please don't kill us."
3,9,ELIZABETH,We were just getting Renee a lower mortgage rate!
3,9,RUBY,"Next time you point that gun at me, I'm not gonna just disappear, understand?"
3,9,DEAN,You ... saved my life.
3,9,RUBY,Don't mention it.
3,9,DEAN,"What was that stuff? God, it was ass.  It tasted like ass."
3,9,RUBY,"It's called witchcraft, short bus."
3,9,DEAN,You're the short bus ... short bus.
3,9,SAM,"Okay, maybe it's not you—"
3,9,SAM,—or you.
3,9,SAM,Maybe it's you.
3,9,TAMMI,I don't even know what he's talking about.  What a–re you even talking about?
3,9,SAM,"I mean, all of you, everyone in your little coven, you've all had runs of good fortune.  Newsworthy good fortune.  Except for you, Tammi. Now tell me, why is that? You didn't want anything for yourself? Or is it because you're already getting what you wanted – like these women's souls."
3,9,TAMMI,I can't- I-I'm not- I-I-I don't...
3,9,TAMMI,"Nice dick work, Magnum."
3,9,SAM,Let.  My brother.  Go.
3,9,TAMMI,"What's wrong?  Couldn't find my hex bag? Sorry, sweetheart, but your brother's lungs should be on the floor by now."
3,9,TAMMI,"You're in a lot of trouble, Sam."
3,9,ELIZABETH,"Tammi, what's wrong with your eyes?"
3,9,RENEE,"Tammi, what are you doing?"
3,9,TAMMI,"Renee, shut your painted hole."
3,9,RENEE,"What? I-I will— You can't— Not in my house, Tammi Fenton."
3,9,SAM,Look.  You got me – let the girl go.
3,9,TAMMI,"Wait your turn, young man."
3,9,TAMMI,"Shhh, Lizzie, it's okay."
3,9,ELIZABETH,You're not Tammi.
3,9,TAMMI,"No, but I'm wearing her meat. I had to break the ice with you girls somehow."
3,9,ELIZABETH,You killed Renee.
3,9,TAMMI,"Renee, Amanda ... That's what happens to witches who get voted off the island."
3,9,ELIZABETH,Who are you?
3,9,TAMMI,"Funny story, actually. You remember all those dark demonic forces you prayed to, when you swore your servitude? Just who did you think you were praying to?"
3,9,ELIZABETH,This-this isn't – it can't b—
3,9,TAMMI,"What did you think it was? Make-believe? Positive thinking? The Secret? No, it was me. You sold yourself to me, you pig."
3,9,TAMMI,"All I had to do was bring one good book to Book Club, and you ladies lined up to kiss my ass."
3,9,ELIZABETH,"No, no, we didn't know—"
3,9,TAMMI,"Oh, yes you did. You knew every step of the way, and now your ever livin' souls are mine."
3,9,TAMMI,"Comments? Questions? Hmm, Sammy Winchester, wow! Right here in our little town. You know, my friends and I, we've been looking for you."
3,9,SAM,"Why? Oh, right, 'cause I'm supposed to lead some piss poor demon army."
3,9,TAMMI,"Nothing personal, it's a P.R. thing, so, buh-bye."
3,9,TAMMI,Two for one.  Lovely.
3,9,RUBY,Wait.
3,9,RUBY (continues),Please. I just ... came to talk.
3,9,TAMMI,"You made it out of the gate.  Impressive. That was a bitch of a fight, wasn't it?"
3,9,RUBY,Doors out of Hell only open for so long.
3,9,TAMMI,"What do you want, Ruby?"
3,9,RUBY,I've been lost without you. (she continues to advance) Take me back. That's why I led the Winchesters here.
3,9,RUBY (continuing),They're for you ... as a gift.
3,9,TAMMI,Really.
3,9,TAMMI,You were one of my best.
3,9,TAMMI,"But then again, you always were a lying whore."
3,9,TAMMI,You're really telling me you threw in your chips with Abbott and Costello here?
3,9,TAMMI,Come on.  Get up.
3,9,TAMMI,"I said, get up!"
3,9,TAMMI,"We've been here before, haven't we?"
3,9,TAMMI,She didn't tell you?
3,9,TAMMI (cotinues),"Pretty mortifying, I guess. She was one of mine. I turned her out a long, long time ago. Ruby here was a witch. Of course, that was when you were human."
3,9,TAMMI,"Didn't want your friends to know that all those centuries back, you sold yourself to me? Embarrassing, I guess. But don't worry love, no secrets where you're heading remember?"
3,9,TAMMI,"Monyé valack forsa, ulu iri regatt ruac, fieesh nieesh forthsa lé inmist infirum forthsa por un betest a té un fornalles ecclaisee –"
3,9,RUBY,Go.
3,9,RUBY,I'll clean up this mess.
3,9,DEAN,Come on.
3,9,RUBY,Go.
3,9,DEAN,"So the devil may care after all, is that what I'm supposed to believe?"
3,9,RUBY,I don't believe in the devil.
3,9,DEAN,"Wacky night. So let me get this straight, you were human once, you died, you went to hell, you became a..."
3,9,RUBY,Yeah.
3,9,DEAN,How long ago?
3,9,RUBY,Back when the plague was big.
3,9,DEAN,So all of 'em – every damn demon – they were all human once?
3,9,RUBY,Every one I've ever met.
3,9,DEAN,"Well, they sure don't act like it."
3,9,RUBY,"Most of them have forgotten what it means, or even that they were. That's what happens when you go to Hell, Dean. That's what Hell is – forgetting what you are."
3,9,DEAN,"Philosophy lesson from a demon.  I'll pass, thanks."
3,9,RUBY,It's not philosophy. It's not a metaphor. There's a real fire in the pit. Agonies you can't even imagine.
3,9,DEAN,"No, I saw ""Hellraiser"". I get the gist."
3,9,RUBY,"Actually, they got that pretty close.  Except for all the custom leather."
3,9,RUBY,"The answer is yes, by the way."
3,9,DEAN,I'm sorry?
3,9,RUBY,"Yes, the same thing will happen to you. It might take centuries, but sooner or later Hell will burn away your humanity. Every Hell-bound soul, every one, turns into something else. Turns you into us.  So yeah.  Yeah, you can count on it."
3,9,DEAN,"There's no way of saving me from the Pit, is there?"
3,9,RUBY,(sighs) No.
3,9,DEAN,Then why'd you tell Sam that you could?
3,9,RUBY,So he would talk to me. You Winchesters can be pretty bigoted. I needed something to help him get past the–
3,9,DEAN,The demon thing? It's pretty hard to get past.
3,9,RUBY,"(laughs) Look at you.  Tryin' to be all stoic. My god, it's heartbreaking."
3,9,DEAN,Why are you telling me all this?
3,9,RUBY,I need your help.
3,9,DEAN,Help with what?
3,9,RUBY,"With Sam. The way you stuck that demon tonight – it was pretty tough. Sam's almost there, but not quite.  You need to help me get him ready – for life without you. To fight this war on his own."
3,9,DEAN,Ruby!  (She pauses)  Why do you want us to win?
3,9,RUBY,"Isn't it obvious? I'm not like them.  I don't know why. I – I wish I was, but ... I'm not. I remember what it's like."
3,9,DEAN,What what's like?
3,9,RUBY,Being human.
3,10,DEAN,Lisa.
3,10,LISA BRAEDEN,Dean!
3,10,LISA (voiceover),"If you want to stick around for a while, you're welcome to stay."
3,10,DEAN,"I can't. I gotta lot of work to do, and it's not my life."
3,10,BELA,I procure unique items for a select clientele.
3,10,DEAN,A thief.
3,10,BOBBY,"Sam, you want to break Dean free of that demon deal, you ain't gonna find the answer in no book."
3,10,SAM (tired),"Then where, Bobby?"
3,10,BOBBY,"Kid, I wish I knew."
3,10,SAM,"I been busting my ass trying to keep you alive, Dean, and you act like you couldn't care less."
3,10,DEAN,"Every damn demon, they were all human once?"
3,10,RUBY,"Every one I've ever met.  The answer is yes, by the way -- the same thing will happen to you."
3,10,DEAN,"There's no way of saving me from the Pit, is there?"
3,10,RUBY,No.
3,10,MAID,Oh! I'm sorry.
3,10,MAID,Sir?
3,10,MAID,Wake up.
3,10,MAID,"Wake up, do you hear me? Wake up. Sir, wake up!"
3,10,MAID,Help! I need some help in here!
3,10,(MUSIC,"Doobie Brothers, ""Long Train Runnin'"")"
3,10,MAN,Cheers!
3,10,DEAN,There you are. What are you doing?
3,10,SAM (shrugs),Having a drink.
3,10,DEAN,It's two in the afternoon. You're drinking whiskey?
3,10,SAM,I drink whiskey all the time.
3,10,DEAN,"No, you don't."
3,10,SAM,"What's the big deal? You get sloppy in bars, you hit on chicks all the time. Why can't I?"
3,10,SAM,"I tried, Dean."
3,10,DEAN,To do what?
3,10,SAM,To save you.
3,10,SAM,"I'm serious, Dean."
3,10,DEAN,"No, you're drunk."
3,10,DEAN,What I've been telling you.
3,10,SAM,"No, that's not what I mean. I mean, no one can save you, because you don't wanna be saved. (pause) I mean, how can you care so little about yourself?"
3,10,SAM (cotinues),What's wrong with you?
3,10,SAM,"So, what's the diagnosis?"
3,10,DOCTOR,We've texted everything we can think to test. He seems perfectly healthy.
3,10,DEAN,Except that he's comatose.
3,10,DEAN,"No, he-he never gets sick. I mean, he doesn't even catch cold."
3,10,SAM,"Doctor, is there anything you can do?"
3,10,DOCTOR,"Look, I'm sorry, but we don't know what's causing it... so we don't know how to treat it. He just... went to sleep, and didn't wake up."
3,10,SAM,"So, what was Bobby doing in Pittsburgh?"
3,10,DEAN,Unless he's taking an extremely lame vacation...
3,10,SAM,"I mean, he must have been working a job, right?"
3,10,DEAN,"Well, you think there'd be some sort of sign of something, you know?"
3,10,DEAN (continues),"Research, news clippings..."
3,10,DEAN,Or a frigging pizza box or a beer can.
3,10,SAM,How 'bout this?
3,10,SAM,You make heads or tails of any of this?
3,10,DEAN,"""Silene capensis"", which of course means absolutely nothing to me."
3,10,SAM,Here.  Obit.
3,10,SAM,"""Dr. Walter Gregg, 64, university neurologist."""
3,10,DEAN,How'd he bite it?
3,10,SAM,"Um.. actually, they don't know. They say he just went to sleep and didn't wake up."
3,10,DEAN,That sound familiar to you?
3,10,SAM,"All right, um... So let's say Bobby was looking into the doc's death. You know, hunting after something-"
3,10,DEAN,–that started hunting him.
3,10,SAM,Yeah.
3,10,DEAN,"All right, stay here. See if you can make heads or tails of this."
3,10,SAM,What are you gonna do?
3,10,DEAN,I'm gonna look into the good doctor myself.
3,10,DEAN,So you're Dr. Gregg's lab assistant?
3,10,SANDERS,That's right.
3,10,DEAN,"Well, his death must have come as a shock to you."
3,10,SANDERS,"Yeah, it did."
3,10,SANDERS,"But, still, go in your sleep, peaceful... That's what you wish for, right?"
3,10,DEAN,Yeah. Right.
3,10,DEAN,Dr. Gregg uh.. studied sleeping disorders?  Dreams?
3,10,SANDERS,I don't understand. I went over all of this with the other detective.
3,10,DEAN,You already spoke to another detective?
3,10,SANDERS,Yes. A very nice older man with a beard.
3,10,DEAN,"Well, I'd love to hear it again if you don't mind."
3,10,SANDERS,"Thing is, I'm sort of busy. Maybe we could do this later?"
3,10,SANDERS,"Look, okay, I didn't know about Dr. Gregg's experiments. Not until I was cleaning out his files."
3,10,SANDERS,"No one knew, okay? Not the university, not anybody. I already spoke with a lawyer and he told me I can't be held liable for anything."
3,10,DEAN,"Maybe you couldn't, but that was before the new evidence came to light."
3,10,SANDERS,New evidence?
3,10,DEAN,Mm-hm.
3,10,SANDERS,What new evidence?
3,10,DEAN,(thinks quickly) I'm not at liberty to say.
3,10,DEAN,"Maybe so. But, uh, still, this- this... this could go on your permanent record. Unless you hand over the doctor's research to me. All of it."
3,10,JEREMY,"Look, I don't know what the RA said, but, ah, I was growing ferns."
3,10,JEREMY,Really?
3,10,DEAN,I wanna talk to you about Dr. Gregg's sleep study.
3,10,JEREMY,"Yeah. Dr. Gregg just died, right?"
3,10,DEAN,"You were one of his test subjects, right?"
3,10,JEREMY,Yeah.
3,10,JEREMY,"Unless you're on ... duty or,  whatever?"
3,10,DEAN,I guess I can make an exception.
3,10,DEAN,"Now, Dr. Gregg was testing treatments for a, uh, ""Charcot-Wilbrand syndrome""? Which means...?"
3,10,JEREMY,"Um.. I, uh.. I can't dream."
3,10,JEREMY,I had this bike accident when I was a kid and banged my head pretty good and I haven't had a dream since. Till the study. You know. Sort of.
3,10,DEAN,What'd the doc give you?
3,10,JEREMY,"It's this yellow tea. It.. it smelled awful, tasted worse."
3,10,JEREMY,That was it. I dropped out of the study right after that. I didn't... like it. To tell you the truth... it kind of scared me.
3,10,SAM,How is he?
3,10,DEAN,No change. What you got?
3,10,DEAN,How so?
3,10,SAM,"This plant, Silene capensis, is also known as African Dream Root? It's been used by shaman and medicine men for centuries."
3,10,DEAN,"Let me guess. They dose up, bust out the didgeridoos, start kicking around the hackey."
3,10,SAM,"Not quite. If you believe the legends, it's used for dreamwalking. I mean, entering another person's dreams, poking around in their heads."
3,10,DEAN,I take it we believe the legends
3,10,SAM,When don't we? But dreamwalking is just the tip of the iceberg.
3,10,DEAN,What do you mean?
3,10,SAM,"I mean, this Dream Root is some serious mojo. You take enough of it, with practice, you can become a regular Freddy Krueger."
3,10,SAM,"You can control anything. You could turn bad dreams good, you could turn good dreams bad."
3,10,DEAN,And killing people in their sleep?
3,10,SAM,For example.
3,10,SAM,"So let's say uh, let's say this doc was testing this stuff on his patients, Tim Leary-style."
3,10,DEAN,"Somebody gets pissed at him, decides to give him a little dream visit, he goes nighty-night."
3,10,SAM,But what about Bobby?
3,10,SAM,"I mean, if the killer came after him, how come he's still alive?"
3,10,DEAN,I don't know.
3,10,BOBBY,HEEEELP MEEEEE!
3,10,DEAN,So how do we find our homicidal sandman?
3,10,SAM,Could be anyone.
3,10,DEAN,Yeah?
3,10,SAM,Yeah.
3,10,DEAN,"Anyone who knew the doctor, had access to his dream shrooms."
3,10,SAM,Maybe one of his test subjects or something?
3,10,DEAN,"Possible. But his research was pretty sketchy. I mean.. I don't know how many subjects he had, or who all of them were."
3,10,DEAN,What?
3,10,DEAN,You know what? You're right.
3,10,SAM,What?
3,10,DEAN,Let's go talk to him.
3,10,DEAN,Not if we're tripping on some Dream Root.
3,10,SAM,What?
3,10,DEAN,You heard me.
3,10,SAM,You wanna go dreamwalking inside Bobby's head?
3,10,DEAN,Yeah. Why not? Maybe we could help.
3,10,SAM,We have no idea what's crawling around in there.
3,10,DEAN,Well how bad could it be?
3,10,SAM,Bad.
3,10,DEAN,"Dude, it's Bobby."
3,10,DEAN,Crap.
3,10,SAM,What?
3,10,DEAN,Bela.
3,10,DEAN,"I'm feeling dirty just thinking about it, but yeah."
3,10,BELA,"Hey, Sam."
3,10,BELA,"Well, I'm full of surprises. Though, truthfully..."
3,10,BELA,You wanna know why I'm here?
3,10,SAM,Okay.
3,10,BELA,Because of you.
3,10,SAM,Uh.. What are you doing?
3,10,BELA,I can't stop thinking about you.
3,10,SAM,Are you sure?
3,10,BELA,Mmmm.... Sam. Sam. Sam. Oh!
3,10,DEAN (V.O),Sam! Wake up.
3,10,CUT TO,
3,10,DEAN,"Dude, you were out. And making some serious happy noises."
3,10,DEAN,Who were you dreaming about?
3,10,SAM,What? No one. Nothing.
3,10,DEAN,"C'mon, you can tell me. Angelina Jolie?"
3,10,SAM,No.
3,10,DEAN,Brad Pitt?
3,10,SAM,"No. No! Dude, it doesn't matter."
3,10,DEAN,Whatever.
3,10,DEAN,I called Bela.
3,10,DEAN,"Shockingly, no, which puts us back to square one. I've been trying to decipher the doctor's notes. Unfortunately, he has worse handwriting than you do."
3,10,SAM,"Yeah, yeah. Just give me a sec."
3,10,DEAN,Bela. As I live and breathe.
3,10,BELA,You called me. Remember?
3,10,DEAN,I remember you turning me down.
3,10,BELA,"Well, I'm just full of surprises."
3,10,SAM,"Hey, Bela. What's going on?"
3,10,BELA,I brought you your African Dream Root.
3,10,BELA,"Nasty stuff, and not easy to come by."
3,10,DEAN,Why the sudden change of heart?
3,10,BELA,What? I can't do you a little favor every now and again?
3,10,DEAN,No.  You can't.
3,10,DEAN,"Come on, I wanna know what the strings are before you attach them."
3,10,BELA,"You said this was for Bobby Singer, right?"
3,10,BELA,"Well, I'm doing it for him. Not you."
3,10,DEAN,Bobby? Why?
3,10,BELA,"I screwed up and he saved me, okay? You satisfied?"
3,10,DEAN,Maybe.
3,10,BELA,So when do we go on this little magical mystery tour?
3,10,DEAN,"Oh, you're not going anywhere. I don't trust you enough to let you in my car, much less Bobby's head. No offense."
3,10,BELA,None taken.
3,10,BELA,It's 2 am. Where am I supposed to go?
3,10,DEAN,"Get a room. Ah, they got the Magic Fingers, a little Casa Erotica on pay-per-view. You'll love it."
3,10,BELA,You...
3,10,SAM,Nice to see-.. Seeing you...
3,10,SAM,... Bela.
3,10,DEAN,"Uh, should we dim the lights and synch up Wizard of Oz to Dark Side of the Moon?"
3,10,SAM,Why?
3,10,DEAN,What did you do during college?
3,10,SAM,"Wait, wait, wait. Whew.  Can't forget this."
3,10,SAM,Here.
3,10,DEAN,What the hell is that?
3,10,SAM,That's how you control whose dream you're entering. You gotta ... drink some of their uh... some of their body.
3,10,DEAN,"Well, guess the hair of the dog is better than other parts of the body."
3,10,DEAN,Bottoms up.
3,10,DEAN,Feel anything?
3,10,SAM,No. You feel anything?
3,10,DEAN,Maybe we got some bad shwag.
3,10,SAM,"Hey, when did it start raining?"
3,10,DEAN,When did it start raining upside down?
3,10,SAM,"Wait. Wait a sec. Imagine the place, uh, without the paint job. (SAM begins gesturing to everything he's talking about.) More cluttered, dusty, books all over the place."
3,10,SAM,Yeah.
3,10,SAM,Dean?
3,10,SAM,I'm gonna go look outside.
3,10,SAM,"Dude, I'll be fine. Just, look around in here. Look, we gotta find him."
3,10,DEAN,Don't do anything stupid.
3,10,SAM,Dean!
3,10,SAM,Dean!
3,10,DEAN,Bobby?
3,10,DEAN,Bobby!
3,10,BOBBY,Dean?
3,10,DEAN,Yeah. It's me. Open up.
3,10,DEAN,Hey.
3,10,BOBBY,How in the hell did you find me?
3,10,DEAN,Sam and I got our hands on some of that Dream Root stuff.
3,10,BOBBY,Dream Root? What?
3,10,DEAN,"Dr. Gregg, the experiments?"
3,10,BOBBY,What the hell are you talking about?
3,10,BOBBY,Hurry.
3,10,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?"
3,10,BOBBY,She's coming.
3,10,DEAN,"Okay, you know this is a dream, don't you?"
3,10,DEAN,"It's a dream, Bobby! None of this is real!"
3,10,BOBBY,Does that look made-up?
3,10,DEAN,"Bobby, who is that?"
3,10,BOBBY,She's... She's my wife.
3,10,KAREN SINGER,Why did you do this to me?
3,10,BOBBY,I'd rather died myself than hurt you.
3,10,KAREN SINGER,But you did hurt me. You shoved that knife into me. Again and again. You watched me bleed. Watched me die.
3,10,DEAN,"Bobby, she's not real."
3,10,BOBBY,"You were possessed, baby. You were rabid. And I didn't know what I know now. I didn't know how to save you."
3,10,DEAN,Come on!
3,10,SAM,Who are you?
3,10,JEREMY,Who are you? You don't belong here.
3,10,SAM,You're one to talk. You're in my friend's head.
3,10,JEREMY,You got a poor choice in friends. This is self-defense. He came after me. He wanted to hurt me.
3,10,SAM,That may be because you're a killer.
3,10,JEREMY,You should be nicer to me. In here... you're just an insect. I'm a god.
3,10,DEAN,"Bobby! This is your dream.  And you can wake up. I mean, hell, you can do anything."
3,10,BOBBY (despairing),Just leave me alone. Let her kill me already.
3,10,BOBBY,I'm dreaming?
3,10,DEAN,Yes! Now take control of it.
3,10,BOBBY,I don't believe it.
3,10,JEREMY,Sweet dreams.
3,10,DEAN,"Hey, Bobby. That, uh... That stuff, all that stuff with your wife?"
3,10,DEAN,That actually happen?
3,10,BOBBY,Everybody got into hunting somehow.
3,10,DEAN,I'm sorry.
3,10,SAM,"So, uh, stoner boy wasn't in his dorm. My guess is he's long gone by now."
3,10,BOBBY,He ain't much of a stoner.
3,10,DEAN,No?
3,10,BOBBY,"No. His name's Jeremy Frost. Full-on genius. Hundred-and-sixty IQ. Which is sayin' some, considering his dad took a baseball bat to his head."
3,10,BOBBY,Here's Father of the Year.
3,10,BOBBY,He died before Jeremy was 10.
3,10,SAM,Looks like a real sweetheart.
3,10,BOBBY,Injury gave him Charcot-Wilbrand.  He hasn't dreamt since.
3,10,DEAN,Till he started dosing the dream drug.
3,10,BOBBY,Yep.
3,10,DEAN,How'd he know how to dig up your worst nightmare and throw it at you?
3,10,BOBBY,"Hey, he was rooting around in my skull. God knows what he saw in there."
3,10,SAM,"Yeah. How'd he get in there in the first place? Isn't he supposed to have some of your hair, your DNA, or something?"
3,10,DEAN,Yeah.
3,10,BOBBY,"Yeahhhh. 'Fore I knew it was him, he offered me a beer. I drank it. (DEAN's face is showing a growing realization.) Dumbest frigging thing."
3,10,SAM,"Dean, you didn't."
3,10,DEAN,I was thirsty?
3,10,DEAN,"Well, now we just have to find him first."
3,10,BOBBY,We better work fast ...  and coffee up. Because the one thing we cannot do – is fall asleep.
3,10,SUBTITLE,Two Days Later
3,10,DEAN,"I mean, this Jeremy guy's not a friggin' ghost. Where the hell could he be?"
3,10,SAM,"Dean, you sure you don't want me to drive? You seem a little..."
3,10,SAM,... caffeinated.
3,10,DEAN (angrily),"Well, thanks for the news flash, Edison!"
3,10,DEAN,Tell me you got something!
3,10,BOBBY,"Strip club was a bust, huh?"
3,10,DEAN,Yeah.
3,10,BOBBY,That was our last lead.
3,10,DEAN,"What the hell, Bobby!"
3,10,BOBBY,"Don't yell at me, boy. I'm working my ass off here."
3,10,DEAN,"Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just.. I'm-I'm-I'm tired."
3,10,BOBBY,"Well, who ain't?"
3,10,DEAN,What's Bela got?
3,10,BOBBY,"What do you got, Bela?"
3,10,BELA,"Sorry. Sometimes the spirit world is in a chatty mood, and sometimes it isn't."
3,10,DEAN,"Great! Well, I'm just gonna go blow my brains out now!"
3,10,BOBBY,Let me ask you somethin'.
3,10,BOBBY (continues),What are you doin' helping us?
3,10,BELA,"Bobby, I'm surprised you don't remember."
3,10,BELA,Flagstaff?
3,10,BOBBY,Oh. Yeah. Right. Flagstaff.
3,10,DEAN,"All right, that's it. I'm done."
3,10,SAM,What are you doing?
3,10,DEAN,Taking myself a long-overdue nap.
3,10,SAM,"What?! Dean, Jeremy can come after you."
3,10,DEAN,That's the idea.
3,10,SAM,Excuse me?
3,10,DEAN,"Come on man, we can't find him, so let him come to me."
3,10,SAM,On his own turf? Where he's basically a god?
3,10,DEAN,I can handle it.
3,10,SAM,"Not alone, you can't."
3,10,DEAN,Ow!
3,10,DEAN,What are you doing?
3,10,DEAN,"No, you're not."
3,10,SAM,Why not? At least then it'll be two against one.
3,10,DEAN,'Cause I don't want you digging around in my head.
3,10,SAM,Too bad.
3,10,CUT TO,LATER
3,10,SAM,Dean.
3,10,DEAN,Jeez. (waking up) For the love of God.
3,10,DEAN (continues),What are we still doing here?
3,10,>SAM,I have no idea.
3,10,SAM,There's someone out there.
3,10,LISA,Hey. You gonna sit down?
3,10,LISA,Come on. We only have an hour before we have to pick Ben up from baseball.
3,10,DEAN,I've never had this dream before.
3,10,SAM,Sorry.
3,10,LISA,Dean. I love you.
3,10,DEAN,Where'd she go?
3,10,SAM,Dean.
3,10,DEAN,Okay.
3,10,SAM,Dean?!
3,10,DEAN,Jeremy?
3,10,DREAM DEAN,"Hey, Dean."
3,10,DEAN,"Well, aren't you a handsome son of a gun."
3,10,DREAM DEAN,We need to talk.
3,10,DEAN (nodding),"I get it. I get it. I'm my own worst nightmare, is that it? Huh? Kind of like the Superman III junkyard scene? A little mano y mano with myself?"
3,10,DREAM DEAN,"Joke all you want, smart-ass. But you can't lie to me. I know the truth."
3,10,DREAM DEAN,I know how dead you are inside. How worthless you feel. I know how you look into a mirror... and hate what you see.
3,10,DREAM DEAN,Sure I am. I'm you.
3,10,DREAM DEAN,I'm not going anywhere. Neither are you.
3,10,DREAM DEAN,Like I said...
3,10,SAM,Dean.
3,10,SAM,Hey.
3,10,SAM,Wake up.
3,10,JEREMY,"Boy, you just don't know when to leave well enough alone, do you?"
3,10,JEREMY,You're wrong.
3,10,SAM,Yeah? Tell that to Dr. Gregg.
3,10,JEREMY,"The doc? No, no. The doc's the one that got me hooked on this stuff and then he took it away."
3,10,JEREMY,"But I needed it, and he wouldn't let me have it."
3,10,SAM,So you killed him?
3,10,JEREMY,"I can dream again. You know what that's like, not to be able to dream? You never rest, not really. It's like being awake for 15 years."
3,10,SAM,And let me guess. That makes you go crazy?
3,10,JEREMY,I just wanna be left alone. I just wanna dream.
3,10,SAM,Sorry. Can't do that.
3,10,JEREMY,That's the wrong answer.
3,10,JEREMY,I'm getting better and better at this. Stronger and stronger all the time.
3,10,JEREMY,But you and your brother? You're not waking up. Not this time. I'm not gonna let you.
3,10,DREAM DEAN,"I mean, after all, you've got nothing outside of Sam."
3,10,DREAM DEAN,"No? What are the things that you want? What are the things that you dream? I mean, your car? That's Dad's. Your favorite leather jacket?  Dad's.  Your music?  Dad's. Do you even have an original thought?"
3,10,DREAM DEAN,"No. No, all there is is, ""Watch out for Sammy. Look out for your little brother, boy!"" You can still hear your Dad's voice in your head, can't you?"
3,10,DREAM DEAN,Clear as a bell.
3,10,DREAM DEAN,"I mean, think about it ..."
3,10,DREAM DEAN,"... all he ever did is train you, boss you around."
3,10,DREAM DEAN,"But Sam .... Sam he doted on. Sam, he loved."
3,10,DEAN,I mean it. I'm getting angry.
3,10,DEAN,"All that crap he dumped on me, about protecting Sam! That was his crap. He's the one who couldn't protect his family. He-"
3,10,DEAN,He's the one who let Mom die.
3,10,DEAN,– who wasn't there for Sam. I always was! He wasn't fair! I didn't deserve what he put on me.
3,10,DEAN,And I don't deserve to go to Hell!
3,10,JEREMY,You can't stop me. There's nothing I can't do in here.
3,10,JEREMY,That's right.
3,10,SAM,"Yeah? Well, you're forgetting something."
3,10,JEREMY,What's that?
3,10,SAM,I took the Dream Root too.
3,10,MAN,Jeremy!
3,10,HENRY,Jeremy!
3,10,JEREMY,No. No ....
3,10,JEREMY,Dad?
3,10,HENRY,"You answer me when I'm talking to you, boy."
3,10,JEREMY,No ....
3,10,BOBBY,"So you did a little dream-weaving of your own in here, huh?"
3,10,SAM,"Yeah. I just sort of concentrated and it happened, you know?"
3,10,BOBBY,"Didn't have anything to do with... you know, your psychic stuff?"
3,10,SAM,"No. I mean, I don't think so."
3,10,DEAN,"Hey, you guys seen Bela? She's not in her room. She's not answering her phone."
3,10,SAM,She must've taken off or something. <
3,10,DEAN,I thought you saved her life.
3,10,DEAN,The thing in Flagstaff.
3,10,BOBBY,"That thing in Flagstaff was an amulet. I gave her a good deal, that's all."
3,10,SAM,"Well, the why did y-?"
3,10,BOBBY,You boys better check your pockets.
3,10,BOBBY,Not literally.
3,10,SAM,The Colt.
3,10,SAM,Bela stole the Colt.
3,10,BOBBY,"Damn it, boys!"
3,10,DEAN,Pack you crap.
3,10,SAM,Why? Where are we going?
3,10,DEAN,We're gonna go hunt the bitch down.
3,10,DEAN,"Hey, Sam. I was wondering. When you were in my head, what did you see?"
3,10,DEAN,Nothing. I was looking for you the whole time.
3,10,DEAN,Sam.
3,10,SAM,Yeah?
3,10,DEAN,I don't wanna go to hell.
3,10,DEMON DEAN,And this? This is what you're gonna become!
3,11,JOHN WINCHESTER,"Back in 1835, Samuel Colt made a gun. They say this gun can kill anything."
3,11,BOBBY,Bela Talbot's her real name.
3,11,DEAN,Is she a hunter?
3,11,BOBBY,She's pretty friggin' far from a hunter.
3,11,SAM,The Colt. Bela stole the Colt.
3,11,RUBY,I need your help.
3,11,DEAN,Help with what?
3,11,RUBY,With Sam.  You need to help me get him ready to fight this war on his own.
3,11,DEAN,"Rise and shine, Sammy!"
3,11,SAM,Dude. Asia?
3,11,DEAN,Come on. You love this song and you know it.
3,11,SAM,"Yeah, and if I ever hear it again I'm gonna kill myself."
3,11,DEAN,"What? Sorry, couldn't hear you. (SAM laughs)"
3,11,SAM,"Whenever you're ready, Dean."
3,11,DEAN,This yours?
3,11,DEAN,Bingo.
3,11,CASHIER,"Drive safely now, Mr. Pickett."
3,11,MR. PICKETT,"Yeah, yeah."
3,11,WAITRESS,"Can't stay unless you order something, Cal. You know the rules."
3,11,CAL,Some coffee.
3,11,DEAN,Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.
3,11,DEAN,"I'm telling you, Sam, this job is small fry. We should be spending our time hunting down Bela."
3,11,SAM,"Okay, sure, let's get right on that. Where is she again?"
3,11,DEAN,Shut up.
3,11,SAM,"Look.  Believe me, I want to find her as bad as you do. In the meantime, we have this."
3,11,DEAN,"All right, so this professor."
3,11,DEAN,Last known location?
3,11,SAM,His daughter says he was on his way to visit the Broward County Mystery Spot.
3,11,DEAN,Where the laws of physics have no meaning.
3,11,DORIS,"Two coffees, black, and some hot sauce for the—"
3,11,DORIS,Whoops. Crap! Sorry. (She turns to the back.) Cleanup!
3,11,DEAN (sarcastically),Wow. Uncanny.
3,11,DEAN,Find anything?
3,11,SAM,No.
3,11,DEAN,Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. Whoa. We can explain.
3,11,SAM,Dean!
3,11,SAM,Hey!
3,11,SAM,Call 911!
3,11,OWNER,I—I didn't mean to—
3,11,SAM,Now!
3,11,SAM,"Hey, hey, oh, no, no, no ...  not like this..."
3,11,SAM,Dean.
3,11,DEAN,"Rise and shine, Sammy!"
3,11,DEAN,Dude. Asia.
3,11,SAM,Dean.
3,11,DEAN,"Oh, come on, you love this song and you know it."
3,11,DEAN,What?
3,11,SAM,I don't know.
3,11,DEAN,You all right?
3,11,SAM,I think I—
3,11,SAM,"Man, I had a weird dream."
3,11,DEAN,Yeah? Clowns or midgets?
3,11,CASHIER,"Drive safely now, Mr. Pickett."
3,11,MR. PICKETT,"Yeah, yeah."
3,11,WAITRESS,"Can't stay unless you order something, Cal. You know the rules."
3,11,CAL,Coffee.
3,11,DEAN,Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.
3,11,SAM,It's Tuesday?
3,11,DEAN,Yeah.
3,11,DORIS,Are you boys ready?
3,11,DEAN,"Yes, I'll have the special, side of bacon and a coffee."
3,11,SAM,"Uh, nothing for me, thanks."
3,11,DORIS,Let me know if you change your mind.
3,11,DEAN,"I'm telling you, Sam, this job is small fry. We should be spending our time hunting down Bela."
3,11,DEAN,You with me?
3,11,SAM,What?
3,11,DEAN,You sure you feel okay?
3,11,SAM,You don't—you don't remember? Any of this?
3,11,DEAN,Remember what?
3,11,SAM,This. Today. Like it's—like it's ... happened before?
3,11,DEAN,You mean like déjà vu?
3,11,SAM,"No, I mean like, like it's really happened before."
3,11,DEAN,Yeah. Like déjà vu.
3,11,SAM,"No, forget about déjà vu. I'm asking you if it feels like, like we're living yesterday all over again."
3,11,DEAN,"Okay, how is that not dé—"
3,11,"SAM, angry","Don't, don't say it! Just don't even..."
3,11,DORIS,"Coffee, black, and some hot sauce for the—oops! Crap!"
3,11,DORIS,Thanks.
3,11,DEAN,Nice reflexes.
3,11,DEAN,"Sam, I'm sorry, but I don't know what the hell you're talking about."
3,11,SAM,"Okay, look. Yesterday was Tuesday, right? But today is Tuesday too."
3,11,DEAN,Yeah. No. Good. You're totally balanced.
3,11,SAM,So you don't believe me?!
3,11,BLONDE GIRL,Excuse me.
3,11,DEAN,"Look, I'm just saying that it's crazy, you know, I mean, even for us crazy. Dingo ate my baby crazy. Hey, maybe it was another of your psychic premonitions."
3,11,SAM,"No, no way, way too vivid. Okay, look, we were at the Mystery Spot, and then—"
3,11,DEAN,And then what?
3,11,MOVER 1,Told you it wouldn't fit.
3,11,MOVER 2,"What do you want, a Pulitzer?"
3,11,SAM,Wait a minute! The Mystery Spot. You think maybe it—
3,11,DEAN,Maybe what?
3,11,SAM (sighs),"We gotta check that place out. Look, just – go with me on this, okay?"
3,11,DEAN,"All right, all right, we'll go tonight, after close, get ourselves a nice long look."
3,11,SAM,"Wait, what? No."
3,11,DEAN,Why not?
3,11,SAM,"Uhh (not wanting to say) – Let's just go now. Right now. Business hours, nice and crowded."
3,11,DEAN,"My God, you're a freak."
3,11,SAM,Dean.
3,11,DEAN,Okay! Whatever. We'll go now.
3,11,SAM,Dean!
3,11,SAM,"Dean, no, no, no."
3,11,SAM,Come on! Dean.
3,11,SAM,Hey. Dean.
3,11,SAM,Dean. Dean.
3,11,DEAN,"Rise and shine, Sammy!"
3,11,DEAN,Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.
3,11,SAM,"Okay, would you listen to me, Dean? 'Cause I am flipping out."
3,11,DORIS,Are you boys ready?
3,11,SAM,"He'll take the special, side of bacon, coffee, black. Nothing for me, thanks."
3,11,DORIS,You got it.
3,11,DEAN,"Sammy, I get all tingly when you take control like that."
3,11,SAM,"Quit screwing around, Dean."
3,11,DEAN,"Okay.  Okay.   I'm listening. So, so – you think that you're in some kind of a what again?"
3,11,SAM,Time loop.
3,11,DEAN,"Like ""Groundhog Day""."
3,11,SAM,"Yes, exactly. Like ""Groundhog Day""."
3,11,"DEAN, nodding",Uh-huh.
3,11,SAM,So you don't believe me.
3,11,DEAN (laughs),"It's just a little crazy, I mean even for us crazy, you know, like, uh—"
3,11,SAM,Dingo ate my baby crazy?
3,11,DEAN,How'd you know I was going to say that?
3,11,SAM,"Because you said it before, Dean, that's my whole point."
3,11,DORIS,"Coffee, black, and some hot sauce for the—whoops! Crap."
3,11,DORIS,Thanks.
3,11,DEAN,Nice reflexes.
3,11,SAM,No. I knew it was going to happen.
3,11,DEAN (sighs),"Okay, look.  I'm sure that there's some sort of an explanation—"
3,11,SAM,"You're just going to have to go with me on this, Dean, you just have to, you owe me that much!"
3,11,DEAN,Calm down–
3,11,SAM,Don't tell me to calm down!  I can't calm down. I can't. Because—
3,11,DEAN,Because what?
3,11,SAM,"Because you die, today, Dean."
3,11,DEAN,I'm not gonna die. Not today.
3,11,SAM,"Twice now I've watched you die, and I can't— I won't do it again, okay? You're just going to have to believe me. Please."
3,11,DEAN,"All right. I still think you're nuts, but okay, whatever this is, we'll figure it out."
3,11,BLONDE GIRL,Excuse me.
3,11,MOVER 1,Told you it wouldn't fit.
3,11,MOVER 2,"What do you want, a Pulitzer?"
3,11,DEAN,And you think this cheesy-ass tourist trap has something to do with it?
3,11,SAM,"Maybe it's the real deal, you know? The, the magnetic fields bending spacetime or whatever."
3,11,DEAN,"I don't know, it all seems a little too ""X-Files"" for me."
3,11,SAM,"Well, I don't know how else to explain it, Dean!"
3,11,DEAN,"All right! All right. We'll go tonight after they close, get ourselves a nice long look."
3,11,SAM,"No no no no no, we can't."
3,11,DEAN,Why not?
3,11,SAM,"Because y–y–ou— (he stops, unable to finish)"
3,11,DEAN,I what?
3,11,DEAN,I die there?
3,11,SAM,"Blown away, actually."
3,11,DEAN,"Huh. Okay, let's go now."
3,11,MR. PICKETT,Stay out of the way!
3,11,DEAN,"Wait, did he –?"
3,11,SAM,Yesterday.  Yeah.
3,11,DEAN,And?
3,11,SAM,And what?
3,11,DEAN,"Did it look cool, like in the movies?"
3,11,SAM (irritated),You peed yourself.
3,11,OWNER,"Boys, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. We could use all the good ink we can get."
3,11,SAM,"How long have you owned the place, Mr. Carpiak?"
3,11,OWNER,"Well, my family's been guarding the secrets here since you don't want to know when."
3,11,SAM,So you'd know if anything strange happened.
3,11,OWNER,Strange? Strange happens here all the time. It's a Mystery Spot. (chuckles)
3,11,SAM,What exactly does that mean?
3,11,OWNER,"Well, uh ... it's where the laws of physics have no meaning."
3,11,"SAM, angry","Okay, like how?"
3,11,"OWNER, grinning",Take the tour.
3,11,DEAN,"The guy who went missing, Dexter Hasselback, he take the tour?"
3,11,OWNER,"Uh, uh, hold on a minute, what kind of article is this?"
3,11,SAM,Just answer the question.
3,11,OWNER,The police scoured every inch of this place. They couldn't find that man. I never seen him before. We're a family establishment—
3,11,SAM,Listen to me. There is something weird going on here. Now do you know anything about it or not?
3,11,OWNER,"Okay. Look. Guys. Um. Give me a break. I bought the joint at a foreclosure auction last March, all right? Hell, I used to sell bail bonds."
3,11,DEAN,"Okay, Kojak, let's get some air."
3,11,DEAN,"Well, I hate to say it, but that place is exactly what I thought - it's full of crap."
3,11,SAM,"Then what is it, Dean, what the hell is happening to us?"
3,11,DEAN,"I don't know. All right, let me just – So, every day I die."
3,11,SAM,Yeah.
3,11,DEAN,"And that's when you wake up again, right?"
3,11,SAM,Yeah.
3,11,DEAN,"So let's just make sure I don't die. If I make it to tomorrow, then maybe the loop stops and we can figure all this out."
3,11,SAM,You think?
3,11,DEAN,"It's worth a shot. I say we grab some takeout and head back to the motel, lay low until midnight."
3,11,DEAN,"All right, good. Who wants Chinese?"
3,11,DEAN,"Rise and shine, Sammy!"
3,11,DEAN,"I still think you're nuts, but ... whatever this is, we'll figure it out."
3,11,SAM,Thanks.
3,11,DEAN,"So, uh ... If you're stuck in ""Groundhog Day"", why? What's behind it?"
3,11,SAM,"Well, first I thought it was the Mystery Spot. Now I'm not so sure."
3,11,DEAN,What do we do?
3,11,SAM,"Well, we keep you breathing. Try to make it to tomorrow. I mean, that's the only thing I can think of."
3,11,DEAN,Shouldn't be too hard.
3,11,SAM,"Yeah, right.  Dean, I've watched you die a few times now and I can't ever seem to stop it."
3,11,DEAN,"Well, nothing's set in stone. You say I order the same thing every day, right?"
3,11,SAM,"Yeah. Pig in a poke, side of bacon."
3,11,DEAN,"'Scuse me, sweetheart?"
3,11,DEAN,Can I get sausage instead of bacon?
3,11,DORIS,"Sure thing, hon."
3,11,DEAN,"See? Different day already. You see, if you and I decide that I am not gonna die – I'm not gonna die."
3,11,DEAN,Thank you.
3,11,SAM,Dean. Dean?
3,11,DEAN,You mean we can't even go out for breakfast?
3,11,SAM,You'll thank me when it's Wednesday!
3,11,DEAN,Whatever that means.
3,11,DEAN,Do these tacos taste funny to you?
3,11,DEAN,"Maybe you should drop the axe and let this guy go, what do you say?"
3,11,SAM,Something's gotta be going on here. I intend to find out what.
3,11,DEAN,"Place is tore up pretty good, dude. Time to give it a rest."
3,11,SAM,NO! I'm gonna take it down to studs.
3,11,SAM offscreen,"Leave it, Dean."
3,11,DEAN offscreen,Give it.
3,11,SAM offscreen,"No, you give it."
3,11,DEAN offscreen,Let it go.
3,11,SAM offscreen,No.
3,11,DEAN offscreen,"Let it go, come on!"
3,11,SAM offscreen,"Dean, leave it, please—"
3,11,SAM,Dean?
3,11,CASHIER,"Drive safely now, Mr. Pickett."
3,11,MR. PICKETT,"Yeah, yeah."
3,11,WAITRESS,"Can't stay unless you order something, Cal. You know the rules."
3,11,CAL,Coffee.
3,11,DEAN,Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.
3,11,DEAN,What are those?
3,11,SAM,"The old man's. Trust me, you don't want him behind the wheel."
3,11,DORIS,You boys ready?
3,11,DEAN,"Uh, yes, we are. I'll have the special, side of bacon and a coffee."
3,11,SAM,"Hey, Doris? What I'd like is for you to log in some more hours at the archery range. You're a terrible shot."
3,11,DORIS,How'd you know that?
3,11,SAM,Lucky guess.
3,11,DEAN,"Okay, so you think you're caught in some kind of what, again?"
3,11,SAM,Time loop.
3,11,SAM,"Yeah, I am. You wanna know why? Because this is the hundredth Tuesday in a row I've been through, and it never stops. Ever. So yeah, I'm a little grumpy. Hot sauce."
3,11,DEAN,What?
3,11,DORIS,"Coffee, black, and some hot sauce for the—whoops! Crap!"
3,11,DORIS,Thanks.
3,11,DEAN,Nice reflexes.
3,11,SAM,"I knew it was going to happen, Dean. I know everything that's gonna happen."
3,11,SAM,Yeah.  I do.
3,11,SAM,It wasn't a guess.
3,11,DEAN,"Okay, enough!"
3,11,SAM,That's not all. Randy the cashier? He's skimming from the register. Judge Myers? At night he puts on a furry bunny outfit.
3,11,SAM,"Over there, that's Cal. He's gonna rob Tony the mechanic on the way home."
3,11,DEAN,What's your point?
3,11,SAM,"My point is I've lived through every possible Tuesday. I've watched you die every possible way. I have ripped apart the Mystery Spot, burnt it down, tried everything I know to save your life, and I can't. No matter what I do, you die. And then I wake up. And then it's Tuesday again."
3,11,SAM,Dog.
3,11,DEAN,There's gotta be some way out of this.
3,11,SAM,"""Where's my dang keys?"""
3,11,MR. PICKETT,Where's my dang keys?
3,11,SAM,"""Excuse me."""
3,11,BLONDE GIRL,Excuse me.
3,11,DEAN,She's kinda cute. (chuckles)
3,11,DEAN,"Hey. All the times we've walked down this street, I ever do this?"
3,11,DEAN offscreen,"Excuse me, miss!"
3,11,DEAN,A hundred Tuesdays and you never bothered to check what she was holding in her hands?
3,11,DEAN,That's the guy who went missing?
3,11,SAM,Yeah?
3,11,DEAN,That's his daughter back there.
3,11,SAM,"Ma'am? Ah, Miss?"
3,11,SAM,"So the police report says Dexter Hasselback is a professor, but that's not all he is."
3,12,DEAN,Any sign of it?
3,12,SAM,Nothing. Are you sure this is Bela’s room?
3,12,DEAN,(Holds up two wigs and shows them to SAM) I’d say so.
3,12,BELA,"Dean? Sweetie, are you there?"
3,12,DEAN,Where are you?
3,12,BELA,Two states away by now.
3,12,DEAN,Where?
3,12,BELA,Where’s our usual quippy banter? I miss it.
3,12,DEAN,"I want it back, Bela… now."
3,12,BELA,"Your little pistol, you mean? (Looks at the Colt on the seat next to her) Sorry, I can’t at the moment."
3,12,DEAN,You understand how many people are gonna die if you do this?
3,12,BELA,What exactly is it that you think I plan to do with it?
3,12,DEAN,Take the only weapon we have against an army of demons and sell it to the highest bidder.
3,12,BELA,You know nothing about me.
3,12,DEAN,I know I’m gonna stop you.
3,12,BELA,Tough words for a guy who can’t even find me.
3,12,DEAN,"Oh, I’ll find you, sweetheart. You know why? Because I have absolutely nothing better to do than to track you down."
3,12,BELA,That’s where you’re wrong. You’re about to be quite occupied. (DEAN looks at SAM) Did you really think I wouldn’t take precautions?
3,12,DEAN,That bitch!
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Hi guys… It’s been a while.
3,12,DAY,POLICE STATION. HENRIKSEN talks to the police.
3,12,MELVIN,So did you get them?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Where is everyone? I asked for all your men.
3,12,MELVIN,And you got them. They want with you on the raid.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Four men? That’s all?
3,12,MELVIN,"Everyone I could drum up with an hour’s notice. We’re a small town, Agent Henriksen."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,What’s he in for?
3,12,PHIL,Drunk and disorderly.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Keys. (PHIL and MELVIN look at HENRIKSEN in disbelief) Now.
3,12,MELVIN,What are you doing?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"(Opens the cell and taps the sleeping man on the back) It is your lucky night, sir. You are free to go."
3,12,MELVIN,What the hell are you doing?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,(Lifts up the man) This way. (Takes the man out of the cell and gives him to PHIL)
3,12,MELVIN,"Agent Henriksen, you can’t just release my prisoners. (HENRIKSEN walks away) Agent Henriksen."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"Look, I get it… you’re Mayberry P.D."
3,12,MELVIN,Excuse me?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,And this isn’t how I’d do it if I had my choice. But a tip’s a tip and we had to move fast. (Walks back to the office)
3,12,MELVIN,"Look, Agent, this ain’t my first rodeo."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,You’ve never been to a rodeo like this before. You have any idea who we’re about to bring in here?
3,12,MELVIN,"Yeah, a couple of fugitives."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"The most dangerous criminals you’ve ever laid your eyeballs on. Think Hannibal Lecter and his half-wit little brother. Do you know what these guys do for kicks? Dig up graves and mutilate corpses. They’re not just killers, Sheriff. They’re Satan-worshipping, nutbag killers."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,So work with me here. I’ll get them out your hair and on their way to Supermax and you’ll be home in enough time to watch the farm report.
3,12,MELVIN,(Nods) However we can help.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,(Comes closer) Those men of yours… post them at the exits.
3,12,MELVIN,Yes sir.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,(Talks into his walkie) Reidy?
3,12,REIDY (V.O.),"Yeah, Vic?"
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Bring them in. (NANCY looks at HENRIKSEN) I guess we’re ready as we’re gonna be.
3,12,DEAN,Why all the sourpusses? (Smiles)
3,12,REIDY,I’ll show you to the cells.
3,12,DEAN,Hey! Hey! Watch the merchandise!
3,12,DEAN,"We’re not the ones you should be scared of, Nancy."
3,12,PRISON CELL,DEAN and SAM are brought to their cell. The police leave them alone. DEAN heads for the bed and SAM to the door. They both almost fall because of the chain.
3,12,SAM,"Dean, come on!"
3,12,DEAN,"All right, all right. Sit?"
3,12,SAM,Yeah.
3,12,DEAN,How we gonna Houdini out of this one?
3,12,SAM,Good question.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,It’s me. Steven in? (Pause) Well get him out of the meeting. (HENRIKSEN looks at MELVIN who watches him)
3,12,FBI OFFICE,Wanted posters for DEAN and SAM are hanging in the wall.
3,12,STEVEN,Groves.
3,12,HENRIKSEN V.O.,I’ve got them.
3,12,STEVEN,"Well, I’ll be damned. (He opens his Winchester case file) I was betting on your headstone reading “Couldn’t catch the Winchester boys.”"
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"Well, they’ll be at Supermax by morning."
3,12,STEVEN,How?
3,12,HENRIKSEN V.O.,"Armored bus, loaded with men."
3,12,STEVEN,"A bus? What, are you trying to give me another ulcer?"
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"Look, we’re taking every precaution."
3,12,STEVEN V.O.,Screw that. I’m sending a chopper.
3,12,STEVEN,Like the last time? And the time before that?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Whatever you think is best.
3,12,STEVEN,"Damn right, and I’ll be on it. I can’t take you losing those boys again. They have been a primary thorn in my ass for months. So Victor…"
3,12,HENRIKSEN V.O.,Yeah?
3,12,STEVEN,Glue your eyeballs to them till I get there.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,(hangs up the phone and addresses MELVIN) There’s a chopper on its way.
3,12,MELVIN,But we don’t have a helicopter pad.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Then clear the damn parking lot.
3,12,CELL,"DEAN looks at HENRIKSEN. SAM glances at HENRIKSEN, then away."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,You know what I’m trying to decide?
3,12,DEAN,I don’t know. What? Whether Cialis will help you with your little condition?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"What to have for dinner tonight. (SAM looks at him) Steak or lobster, what the hell, surf and turf. (DEAN smirks cynically) I got a lot to celebrate. I mean, after all, seeing you two in chains…"
3,12,DEAN,You kinky son of a bitch. We don’t swing that way.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"Now, that’s funny."
3,12,DEAN,"You know, I wouldn’t bust out the melted butter just yet. Couldn’t catch us at the bank, couldn’t keep us in that jail."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,You’re right. Screwed up. I underestimated you. I didn’t count on you being that smart but now I’m ready.
3,12,DEAN,"Yeah, ready to lose us again?"
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"Ready like a court order to keep you in a Supermaximum prison in Nevada till trial. Ready like isolation in a soundproof, windowless cell, so that between you and me… probably unconstitutional."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,How’s that for ready?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Take a good look at Sam – you two will never see each other again.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"Aw. Where’s that smug smile, Dean? I want to see it."
3,12,DEAN,"(Shakes his head, disbelief) You got the wrong guys."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"Oh, yeah. I forgot. You fight monsters. Sorry, Dean. Truth is, your daddy brainwashed you with all that devil talk and no doubt touched you in a bad place. That’s all. That’s reality."
3,12,DEAN,Why don’t you shut your mouth?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"Well, guess what. Life sucks. Get a helmet. ‘Cause everybody’s got a sob story. But not everybody becomes a killer."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,And now I have two less to worry about.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Mm. (tapping his watch) It’s surf and turf time. (Laughs)
3,12,OFFICE,Agent STEVEN GROVES comes inside the office and HENRIKSEN holds out his hand.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Steven!
3,12,STEVEN,"Gentlemen. (Instead of shaking HENRIKSEN's hand, he hands HENRIKSEN some files)"
3,12,HENRIKSEN,(Confused) What’s all this?
3,12,STEVEN,What can I say? The FBI didn’t invent bureaucracy; we perfected it.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,You want me to do all this now?
3,12,STEVEN,"(smiles) Sorry. Now, Victor."
3,12,STEVEN,I’m gonna go take a good long gander at our fugitives.
3,12,STEVEN,Sam and Dean Winchester. I’m Deputy Director Steven Groves. This is a pleasure.
3,12,DEAN,"Well, glad one of us feels that way."
3,12,STEVEN,I’ve been waiting a long time for you two to come out of the woodwork.
3,12,STEVEN,"Sorry, I've gotta cut this short. It’s gonna be a long night, fellas."
3,12,OFFICE,HENRIKSEN and REIDY hear STEVEN’s scream.
3,12,REIDY,What the hell was that?
3,12,CELLS,"STEVEN falls to the ground. PHIL and MELVIN enter, followed by HENRIKSEN, who points his gun at SAM."
3,12,MELVIN,"All right, put the gun down!"
3,12,SAM,Wait. Okay. Wait.
3,12,MELVIN,He shot him!
3,12,SAM,"I didn’t shoot him, okay. I didn’t shoot anyone."
3,12,DEAN,He shot me!
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"Get on your knees, NOW!"
3,12,SAM,"Okay, okay, okay. Don’t shoot. Please. Look. Here. Here. (SAM passes the gun through the bars) Look.  We didn’t shoot him. Check the body. There’s no blood. We did not kill him. Go ahead, check him."
3,12,REIDY,"Vic, there’s no bullet wound."
3,12,DEAN,He’s probably been dead for months.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,What did you do to him?
3,12,DEAN,We didn’t do anything.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Talk or I shoot.
3,12,DEAN,You won’t believe us.
3,12,SAM,He was possessed.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Possessed? Right. Fire up the chopper! We’re taking them out of here now.
3,12,DEAN,Yeah! Do that!
3,12,REIDY,"Bill? (static on the other end of the walkie-talkie) Bill, are you there?"
3,12,NIGHT,"OUTSIDE, REIDY discovers two officers whose throats have been cut. He walks to the chopper. The pilot and two more officers are dead."
3,12,REIDY,(into walkie) They’re dead. I think they’re all dead.
3,12,INSIDE,CELL.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,What the hell was that? Reidy? Reidy?!
3,12,OUTSIDE,The chopper is on fire. REIDY coughs and sits up. HENRIKSEN’s voice is heard from the walkie talkie.
3,12,HENRIKSEN V.O.,What the hell was that? Come in? Reidy? Reidy?
3,12,OFFICE,MELVIN fills his rifle with bullets while NANCY tries to make a call.
3,12,NANCY,Hello? (NANCY keeps trying to get a line.)
3,12,MELVIN,My men? Agent Henriksen— (HENRIKSEN doesn’t answer.)
3,12,PHIL,What the hell’s happening out there?
3,12,NANCY,I can’t get a line. All the phones are out.
3,12,MELVIN,Henriksen! Four of my men!
3,12,NANCY,"The Internet, my cell…. It’s all dead. How can it all be dead?"
3,12,CELL,SAM and DEAN stand up.
3,12,DEAN,"Oh, that can’t be good."
3,12,NANCY,Oh my God.
3,12,MELVIN,"No, it’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay. We’re gonna go, we’re gonna go… right now. (He loads his gun. HENRIKSEN turns around.)"
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Nobody’s going anywhere. Everybody calm down.
3,12,MELVIN,Your partner is out there! My men are out there!
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"I know. We go out there, we’re asking to die too. Don’t you get it?"
3,12,MELVIN,Get what?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"They’re out there and they’re coming in here. This is a siege. So this might be a good time for you to lock the doors and the windows (NANCY looks up, panicking), take a breath, and maybe deal with this like trained professionals with some sense in their heads."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,You okay?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"I wouldn’t think so. Nancy, right? I’m gonna get you through this. You got my word. You got that?"
3,12,SAM,"All right, don’t be such a wuss."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"What’s the plan? Kill everyone in the station, bust you two out?"
3,12,DEAN,What the hell are you talking about?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,I’m talking about your psycho friends. I’m talking about a blood bath.
3,12,DEAN,"Okay, I promise you – whoever’s out there? is not here to help us."
3,12,SAM,"Look, you got to believe us. Everyone here is in terrible danger."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,You think?
3,12,DEAN,Why don’t you let us out of here so we can save your asses?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"From what?  (pause, while Sam and Dean look away) You gonna say “demons”? (Raises his gun, pointed at the ceiling, for emphasis) Don’t you dare say “demons”. Let me tell you something. You should be a lot more scared of me. (He leaves.)"
3,12,SAM,How’s the shoulder?
3,12,DEAN,"(Takes away a pad of toilet paper with a large blood stain on it) It’s awesome. (Tosses away the pad) I’ll live. You know, if we get out of here alive. So you got a plan?"
3,12,DEAN,(quietly to SAM) Hey.
3,12,SAM,Hey…
3,12,SAM,"Hey, uh, please.  Please. We need your help. It’s… it’s Nancy. Nancy, right? (NANCY just looks at SAM) Nancy, my… my brother’s been shot. He’s… He’s bleeding really bad. You think maybe you could get us a towel? Please? Just one clean towel? (NANCY’s not sure and still a bit afraid) Look. Look at us. We’re not the bad guys. I swear."
3,12,DEAN,Nice try.
3,12,SAM,Thank you.
3,12,SAM,It's okay. (He holds out his handcuffed hands)
3,12,PHIL,Let her go! Let her go!
3,12,PHIL,"(Point the gun at SAM) You’re okay, Nance? (Looks at SAM) Try something again, get shot. And not in the arm."
3,12,SAM,Okay.
3,12,DEAN,What the hell was that?
3,12,SAM,We’re like sitting ducks in here.
3,12,DEAN,"Yeah, I know. Would it kill these cops to BRING US A SNACK?! (He shouts the last words)"
3,12,SAM,How many you figure are out there?
3,12,DEAN,I don’t know.
3,12,SAM,"However many they are, they could be possessing anyone. Anyone could just walk right in."
3,12,DEAN,"It's kind of wild, right? I mean it’s like they’re coming for us. They’ve never done that before. (DEAN smiles) It’s like we got a contract on us. Think it’s because we’re so awesome? I think it’s ‘cause we’re so awesome. (He smiles again, but stops smiling after SAM looks at him, unamused)"
3,12,DEAN,"Well, howdy, there, sheriff."
3,12,SAM,"Uh, sheriff?"
3,12,MELVIN,"It’s time to go, boys."
3,12,DEAN,Uh… you know what? We’re – we're just comfy right here. But thank you.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,What do you think you’re doing?
3,12,MELVIN,We’re not just gonna sit around here and wait to die. We’re gonna make a run for it.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,It’s safer here.
3,12,MELVIN,There’s a SWAT facility in Boulder.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,(Comes inside the cell) We’re not going anywhere.
3,12,MELVIN,The hell we’re not.
3,12,DEAN,Stay back!
3,12,DEAN,(to SAM) Hurry up!
3,12,HENRIKSEN,It’s too late. I already called them. They’re already coming.
3,12,NANCY,Is he… is he dead?
3,12,SAM,Henriksen! Hey. Is that you in there?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,I… I shot the sheriff.
3,12,DEAN,(smiles after a pause) But you didn't shoot the deputy.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"Five minutes ago, I was fine, and then…"
3,12,DEAN,Let me guess. Some nasty black smoke jammed itself down your throat?
3,12,SAM,You were possessed.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"Possessed, like… possessed?"
3,12,SAM,That’s what it feels like. Now you know.
3,12,DEAN,I owe the biggest “I told you so” ever. (He gives HENRIKSEN back his gun.)
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Officer Amici. (Stands up and addresses PHIL) Keys...
3,12,HENRIKSSEN,"All right, so how do we survive?"
3,12,DEAN,"Well, that’s nice. It’s not gonna do much good."
3,12,PHIL,We got an arsenal here.
3,12,DEAN,You don’t poke a bear with BB gun. That’s just gonna make them mad.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,What do you need?
3,12,DEAN,Salt. Lots and lots of salt.
3,12,PHIL,Salt?
3,12,DEAN,"What, is there an echo in here?"
3,12,NANCY,There’s road salt in the storeroom.
3,12,DEAN,Perfect. Perfect. We need salt at every window and every door.
3,12,DEAN,"How you holdin’ up, Nancy?"
3,12,NANCY,"Okay. (pause) When I was little, I would come home from the church and start to talk about the devil. And my parents would tell me to stop being so literal. I guess I showed them, huh? (Adds a last piece of tape to DEAN’s bandage) That should hold."
3,12,DEAN,Thank you.
3,12,NANCY,Sure.
3,12,DEAN,"Hey, where's my car?"
3,12,PHIL,Impound lot out back.
3,12,DEAN,Okay.
3,12,PHIL,Wait. (DEAN looks at him) You’re not going out there?
3,12,DEAN,"Yeah, I got to get something out of my trunk."
3,12,DEAN,They’re coming! Hurry.
3,12,SAM,Everybody okay?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Define “okay”.
3,12,DEAN,"All right, everybody needs to put these on. (Gives each of them a protection necklace) They’ll keep you from being possessed. There you go."
3,12,NANCY,What about you and Sam?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Smart. How long you had those?
3,12,SAM,Not long enough.
3,12,CUT TO,"HENRIKSEN looks at MELVIN’s name plate, while DEAN watches him. NANCY is organizing some files when she sees a crowd of people outside."
3,12,NANCY,"Hey, that’s Jenna Rubner."
3,12,SAM,That’s not Jenna anymore.
3,12,NANCY,That’s where all that black demon smoke went?
3,12,SAM,Looks like.
3,12,CUT TO,"PHIL is in another room.  He grabs a chair and stands on it to look out a window, which he wipes with his hand. When he leaves, we see that the salt line is broken."
3,12,BACK TO,MAIN OFFICE.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Shotgun shells full of salt.
3,12,DEAN,(Filling his shotgun) Whatever works.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Fighting off monsters with condiments. (He takes off his tie) So. Turns out demons are real. (He starts filling his rifle with salt shells)
3,12,DEAN,"FYI, ghosts are real too. So are werewolves, vampires, changelings, evil clowns that eat people."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Okay then.
3,12,DEAN,"If it makes you feel better, Bigfoot’s a hoax. (He smiles)"
3,12,HENRIKSEN,It doesn’t. How many demons?
3,12,DEAN,Total? No clue. A lot.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,You know what my job is?
3,12,DEAN,You mean besides locking up the good guys? (Walks over to HENRIKSEN) I have no idea.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"My job is boring, it’s frustrating. You work three years for one break, and then maybe you can save ... a few people. Maybe. That’s the payoff. I’ve been busting my ass for 15 years to nail a handful of guys and all this while, there’s something off in the corner so big. So yeah… sign me up for that big, frosty mug of wasting my damn life."
3,12,DEAN,You didn't know.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Now I do. (Pause) What’s out there? Can you guys beat it? Can you win?
3,12,DEAN,Honestly? I think the world’s gonna end bloody. But it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t fight. We do have choices. I choose to go down swingin’.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Plus you got nothing to go home to but your brother.
3,12,DEAN,Yeah. (nods) What about you? You rockin’ the white picket fence?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"Mmm-mm.  Empty apartment, string of angry ex-wives. I’m right where you are. (chuckles)"
3,12,DEAN,Imagine that.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,(pointing his rifle) How do we kill her?
3,12,SAM,We don’t. (He lowers HENRIKSEN’s rifle)
3,12,HENRIKSEN,She’s a demon.
3,12,SAM,She’s here to help us.
3,12,PHIL,Are you kidding?
3,12,RUBY,Are you gonna let me out?
3,12,RUBY,And they say chivalry’s dead. Does anyone have a breath mint? Some guts splattered in my mouth while I was killing my way in here.
3,12,BACK TO,OFFICE
3,12,DEAN,How many are out there?
3,12,RUBY,30 at least. That’s so far.
3,12,DEAN,"Oh, good. 30. 30 hit men all gunning for us. Who sent them?"
3,12,RUBY,You didn’t tell Dean?
3,12,RUBY,"Oh, I’m surprised."
3,12,DEAN,Tell me what?
3,12,RUBY,There’s a big new up and corner. Real pied piper.
3,12,DEAN,Who is he?
3,12,RUBY,Not he. Her. Her name is Lilith.
3,12,DEAN,Lilith?
3,12,RUBY,"And she really, really wants Sam’s intestines on a stick. ‘Cause she sees him as competition."
3,12,DEAN,"You knew about this? (SAM doesn’t answer) Well, gee, Sam. Is there anything else I should know?!"
3,12,RUBY,"How about the two of you talk about this later? We’ll need the Colt. (RUBY looks at SAM, who doesn’t meet her eyes. She looks at DEAN) Where’s the Colt?"
3,12,SAM,It got stolen.
3,12,RUBY,"I’m sorry. I must have blood in my ear. I thought I just heard you say that you were stupid enough to let the Colt get grabbed out of your thick, clumsy, idiotic hands. Fantastic. This is just peachy…"
3,12,SAM,Ruby…
3,12,RUBY,Shut up. (She raises her hand) Fine. Since I don’t see that there’s no other any option. There’s one other way I know how to get you out of here alive.
3,12,DEAN,What’s that?
3,12,RUBY,"I know a spell. It’ll vaporize every demon in a one-mile radius. Myself included. So, you let the Colt out of your sight and now I have to die. So next time, be more careful. How’s that for a dying wish?"
3,12,DEAN,"Okay, what do we need to do?"
3,12,RUBY,Aww… you can’t do anything. This spell is very specific. It calls for a person of virtue.
3,12,DEAN,(Nods) I got virtue.
3,12,RUBY,(Chuckles) Nice try. You’re not a virgin.
3,12,DEAN,(Laughs) Nobody’s a virgin.
3,12,DEAN,"No. No way. You’re kidding me, r–. You’re…"
3,12,NANCY,"What? It’s a choice, okay?"
3,12,DEAN,"So, y-you’ve never… Not even once? I mean not even – Wow."
3,12,NANCY,"So, this spell. What can I do? (Smiles at RUBY)"
3,12,RUBY,You can hold still ... while I cut your heart out of your chest.
3,12,NANCY,What?
3,12,DEAN,What? Are you crazy?
3,12,RUBY,I’m offering a solution.
3,12,DEAN,You’re offering to kill somebody.
3,12,RUBY,And what do you think’s gonna happen to this girl when the demons get in?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,We’re gonna protect her. That’s what.
3,12,NANCY,Excuse me.
3,12,RUBY,Very noble.
3,12,NANCY,Ex– excuse me.
3,12,RUBY,You’re all gonna die. Look. This is the only way.
3,12,DEAN,"Yeah, yeah. There’s no way that you’re gonna—"
3,12,NANCY,Would everybody please shut up?! (DEAN and RUBY look at NANCY) All the people out there… will it save them?
3,12,RUBY,It’ll blow the demons out of their bodies. So if their bodies are okay… yeah.
3,12,NANCY,"(Long pause, then she nods) I’ll do it."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Hell no.
3,12,DEAN,"No, no."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Hell no.
3,12,DEAN,You don’t need to do this.
3,12,NANCY,All my friends are out there.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"We don't sacrifice people. We do that, we’re no better than them."
3,12,RUBY,We don’t have a choice.
3,12,DEAN,"Yeah, well, your choice is not a choice."
3,12,RUBY,"Sam, you know I’m right."
3,12,DEAN,"(He smiles slightly in the expectation that SAM will agree with him) Sam? (SAM says nothing) What the hell is going on? Sam, tell her."
3,12,NANCY,It’s my decision.
3,12,RUBY,"Damn straight, cherry pie."
3,12,DEAN,"Stop! Stop! Nobody kill any virgins. Sam, I need to talk to you."
3,12,DEAN,Please tell me you’re not actually considering this. We’re talking about holding down a girl and cutting out her heart.
3,12,SAM,"And we’re also talking about 30 people out there, Dean. Innocent people who are all gonna die, along with everyone in here."
3,12,DEAN,"It doesn’t mean that we throw away the rule book and stop acting like humans. I’m not gonna let that demon kill some nice, sweet, innocent girl, who hasn’t even been laid. I mean, look, if that’s how you win wars, then I don’t want to win."
3,12,SAM,"Then what? What do we do, Dean?"
3,12,DEAN,"(Turns away for a moment, then back) I got a plan. I’m not saying it's a good one. I’m not even saying that it’ll work. But it sure as hell beats killing a virgin."
3,12,SAM,"Okay, so, what’s the plan?"
3,12,DEAN,"Open the doors, let them all in and we fight."
3,12,DEAN,Get the equipment to work?
3,12,SAM,Yeah.
3,12,DEAN,So?
3,12,SAM,So this is insane.
3,12,RUBY,You win “understatement of the year.”
3,12,DEAN,"Look, I get it, you think—"
3,12,RUBY,"I don’t think… I know. It’s not gonna work. (She stands up and starts to leave) So long, boys."
3,12,SAM,"So, you’re just gonna leave?"
3,12,RUBY,"Hey. I was gonna kill myself to help you win. I’m not gonna stand here and watch you lose. (Walks closer to SAM) And I’m disappointed because I tried. I really did, but clearly I bet on the wrong horse. (SAM says nothing) Do you mind letting me out?"
3,12,CUT TO,"FRONT DOOR. Someone uses a knife to scratch away the paint forming the devil’s trap, and then breaks the salt line across the doorway. RUBY walks outside, where the demons are waiting. She draws her knife."
3,12,RUBY,I’m leaving. Who wants to stop me?
3,12,DEAN,All set?
3,12,SAM,Yeah!
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Ready!
3,12,DEAN,Let’s do this.
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"God, I hope this works."
3,12,DEAN,Go! Go! Go!
3,12,OUTSIDE,NANCY and PHIL are on the roof watching as more demons run into the building.
3,12,NANCY,"When this is over, I’m gonna have so much sex. (PHIL looks at NANCY) But not with you. We better move."
3,12,INSIDE,DEAN fights demons in a hallway.
3,12,OUTSIDE,NANCY closes a door to the building and lines it with salt.
3,12,INSIDE,SAM flings holy water at demons in the main office.
3,12,OUTSIDE,NANCY and PHIL line the door and windows with salt.
3,12,INSIDE,"SAM and DEAN fling holy water at the demons. When their flasks are empty, the demons gather around them."
3,12,OUTSIDE,NANCY and PHIL take their salt bags and run along the building.
3,12,INSIDE,"JENNA DEMON climbs over a desk and walks towards SAM. She stretches out an arm, which sends SAM and DEAN flying against the wall. They gasp in pain and look at each other."
3,12,DEAN,"Henriksen, now!"
3,12,CUT TO,Audio room. HENRIKSEN struggles with a demon as he tries to play a tape. He manages to turn it on and SAM’s voice speaking an exorcism comes from speakers all over the office. The demons cover their ears.
3,12,OUTSIDE,NANCY is lining a door with salt when a demon bursts out the door. NANCY screams and the demon looks at her with black eyes before he flees. PHIL grabs the bag from NANCY and finishes lining the door.
3,12,OFFICE,"There is an explosion of light on the ceiling, then everything goes still. SAM and DEAN slide down the wall to the floor and look at each other. They get to their feet, groaning. HENRIKSEN walks into the office and chuckles slightly as he wipes blood from his lip. DEAN shrugs. The people who had been possessed start to get up. The electricity flickers back on."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,I better call in. Hell of a story I won’t be telling.
3,12,SAM,So what are you gonna tell them?
3,12,HENRIKSEN,The least ridiculous lie I can come up with in the next five minutes.
3,12,DEAN,"Good luck with that. Not to pressure you or anything, but what are you planning to do about us?"
3,12,HENRIKSEN,"I’m gonna kill you. Sam and Dean Winchester were in the chopper when it caught on fire. Nothing left. Can’t even identify them with dental records. (SAM smiles) Rest in peace, guys."
3,12,HENRIKSEN,Now get out of here.
3,12,SAM,Yeah…
3,12,NANCY,Well hey there.
3,12,LITTLE GIRL,Excuse me. I’m looking for two boys. They’re brothers.
3,12,LITTLE GIRL,One’s really tall and one’s really cute.
3,12,NANCY,"(Laughs) What’s your name, sweetie?"
3,12,LITTLE GIRL,Lilith. (Her eyes turn white)
3,12,MOTEL,SAM is lying on his back on a bed when there is a knock at the door. SAM sits up and DEAN opens the door. It’s RUBY.
3,12,RUBY,(Walks into the room) Turn on the news.
3,12,SAM,Must have happened right after we left.
3,12,RUBY,Considering the size of the blast (RUBY tosses hex bags to DEAN and SAM) ... smart money’s on Lilith.
3,12,DEAN,What’s in these?
3,12,RUBY,"Something that’ll protect you. Throw Lilith off your trail… for the time being, at least."
3,12,SAM,Thanks.
3,12,RUBY,"Don’t thank me. Lilith killed everyone. She slaughtered your precious little virgin, plus a half a dozen other people. So after your big speech about humanity and war, turns out your plan? was the one with the body count. Do you know how to run a battle? You strike fast and you don’t leave any survivors. So no one can go running to tell the boss. So next time… we go with my plan."
3,13,HARRY,Hello. I am Harry Spengler
3,13,ED,"And I am Ed Zeddmore. Now if you have received this tape, you must be some sort of bigwig network executive. Well, today is your lucky day, mister."
3,13,HARRY,"Because the unsolicited pilot you are about to watch is the bold new future of ""reality TV."""
3,13,ED,Mmmm. We know you've had it hard during the crippling writer's strike.
3,13,HARRY,Lazy fat cats.
3,13,ED,Who needs writers when you've got guys like us?
3,13,ED,Our team faced horrible horrors to bring you the footage that will change your world forever. So strap in for the scariest hour in the history of television.
3,13,HARRY,In the history of your life...
3,13,ED,Strap in for...
3,13,MUSIC,"Ghost...Ghostfacers. We face the ghosts when the others will not.
We're Ghost...Ghostfacers. Stay in the kitchen when the kitchen gets hot.
Ghost...Ghostfacers. We face the nightmare, we face the dread.
Ghost...Ghostfacers. We face the faces, we face the dead!"" (screams)
When you trip and fall into the supernatural, 
we're who you're gonna call. We face them all!
Ghost...Ghostfacers. We face the faces, we face the dead!
We're Ghost...Ghostfacers!"
3,13,ED (V.O.),"You know, it can get kind of hard balancing our daytime careers with our nighttime missions."
3,13,HARRY (V.O.),"Yeah, but Ed and I pretty much call the shots at the Kinko's where we work, so we can usually pretty much get off by six every night?"
3,13,ED,"Yeah, six o'clock. It used to be just, you know, you and I taking on the cases -- just Harry and me."
3,13,HARRY,Two lone wolves.
3,13,ED,"And two lone wolves need, uh...other wolves."
3,13,PHASE 1,THE HOMEWORK
3,13,ED,"Morning, 'facers."
3,13,HARRY,"Good morning, Ghostfacers."
3,13,HARRY,"It's morning to a Ghostfacer. Corbett, what do we got, buddy?"
3,13,CORBETT,"Oh, I'm just putting up some of the --"
3,13,ED,"Yeah, this has got to go up here. That's got to go here. got to see the whole field. Markers, eraser -- good job."
3,13,CORBETT,"I first saw Ed putting up flyers down at the -- the outlet mall in Scogan, so I-I read one, and I thought to myself, ""huh. Where do ghosts come from?"" And now here I am."
3,13,HARRY,"Ed, your sister's abusing staff."
3,13,ED,"That's adopted sister, thank you very much."
3,13,MAGGIE,"Ed has been obsessed with the supernatural since we were kids, you know, and then he meets Harry at computer camp...and love at first geek."
3,13,SPRUCE,"Spruce here. What up, playaaa?"
3,13,SPRUCE,"I am 15/16 Jew, 1/16 Cherokee. My grandfather is a mohel, my great-grandfather was a tallis maker, and my great-great-grandfather was a degenerate gambler and had a peyote addiction."
3,13,ED,"Okay, people. Let's cut the chatter and get on a mission. Okay? Morton house..."
3,13,ED,"...one of our big fish. All right, we all know the legend. Every four years, supposedly, this becomes the most haunted place in America."
3,13,HARRY,"The leap year ghost, some call it. The ghost returns at midnight just as February 29th begins."
3,13,MAGGIE,"And no one has ever stayed the night, right?"
3,13,HARRY,"Yeah, well, every testimony that we dug up, every eyewitness has cut and run well before midnight."
3,13,ED,"Well, that's all about to change, baby."
3,13,HARRY,"Absolutely true, Ed. Absolutely true."
3,13,ED,Mmm. That's good.
3,13,CORBETT,"It's French vanilla, 'cause the other day, you said how much you liked it, so..."
3,13,ED,Thank you.
3,13,CORBETT,You are welcome.
3,13,HARRY,"I like Corbett. I do. Shows up early, does his job, lot of good hustle out --"
3,13,CORBETT,"Ed's kind of the more rugged, with that really golden...beautiful sort of beard.  Definitely nice. Uh, and Harry's nice."
3,13,ED,"29th is this Friday, facers. We want this mission, we got to move on it now, or guess what -- He's gone for another four years."
3,13,ED,Dad! Come on!
3,13,HARRY,Just cut the cameras. We don't need that. We don't need this part. We don't --
3,13,PHASE II,INFILTRATION
3,13,ED,"Stay low. Follow formation. Okay, as suspected. A lot of people have tried to break into the Morton house. The local authorities have just gotten fed up."
3,13,HARRY,Looks like the cops have got this place pretty well fenced off.
3,13,MAGGIE,"Wait. Didn't you guys get, like, a permit or something?"
3,13,HARRY,A permit? That's a good idea for next time.
3,13,ED,Yeah.
3,13,HARRY,"Car. shh, shh! Flashlights off."
3,13,MAGGIE,Keep totally still.
3,13,SPRUCE,It's okay. Not cops -- just hicks.
3,13,HARRY,Ed's got it.
3,13,ED,"Hear that, people? Let's keep it quiet."
3,13,HARRY,There's the kitchen sink.
3,13,ED,Copy that. Copy that.
3,13,ED,"All right, everybody. Ghostfacers, let's line up. Everybody. We'll set up camp right here. This is command center one."
3,13,HARRY,We're gonna call this the Eagle's Nest.
3,13,CORBETT,Hallway cam one up and running.
3,13,ED,"Looking good, Corbett."
3,13,CORBETT,"Copy that, Ed."
3,13,ED,"Uh...uh, you're welcome."
3,13,ED,"All right, Spruce, how are we doing there, buddy?"
3,13,SPRUCE,"Checking basement camera two, mein fuhrer."
3,13,ED,"Maggie, I got no visual on you, Maggie."
3,13,MAGGIE,This is Maggie. Do you copy?
3,13,ED,"There you are. Hello. Harry, are you alive?"
3,13,HARRY,"Upstairs, Ed. Camera one."
3,13,ED,"Looking good. I can smell syndication. All right, fellas. Let's regroup at the Eagle's Nest."
3,13,HARRY,"All right, Spengler. Battery check, battery check. Check. Okay."
3,13,SPRUCE,"Check. Check. Yo, Corbett, dude."
3,13,HARRY,"Lookin' good, Corbett."
3,13,SPRUCE,You're Robocop.
3,13,CORBETT,R-robocop?  You think I -- you think I look like Robocop?
3,13,ED,"Everybody, bring it in. Bring it in."
3,13,ALL,Ghostfacers!
3,13,PHASE III,FACE TIME
3,13,ED,Hello! I'm speaking to the restless spirits of the Morton house!
3,13,CORBETT,Okay.
3,13,ED,Hello! My name's Ed. Careful. Watch my back.
3,13,CORBETT,Okay. Okay.
3,13,ED,"What's your name? (Looks at EMF meter) .3, .29."
3,13,CORBETT,Is there an entity or entities here with us now? Can you give us a sign of your presence?
3,13,ED,"You got to breathe, buddy."
3,13,CORBETT,I can't breathe.
3,13,ED,"Corbett, night vision."
3,13,CORBETT,Okay. Okay. Yeah.
3,13,ED,"Calm down, buddy. Breathe, all right? Calm the whirlwinds of your mind."
3,13,2ND FLOOR,"TEAM 2 - HARRY, SPRUCE, MAGGIE"
3,13,HARRY,"We're doing a basic EMF, EVP, temp-flux sweep. Looks like we've got all of our ducks in a row here."
3,13,HARRY,What?
3,13,SPRUCE,I don't know. It's weird. It's gone.
3,13,HARRY,All right. Get this. Get this.
3,13,SPRUCE,Turn the knob.
3,13,HARRY,All right...that's a good idea.
3,13,HARRY,"Oh, my god! Oh, my god!"
3,13,SPRUCE,"It's just a rat, dude."
3,13,HARRY,I don't really like rats. They're gross. Rats are like the... rats of the world.
3,13,HARRY,"What -- was that an apparition? Was that a spectral -- was that a .4? What do we got, 'cause the EMP was just off the --"
3,13,HARRY,"Oh, god! Oh, that is so not funny, Spruce!"
3,13,CORBETT,"Oh, god. Okay, it was just... I think it was just this branch... Okay...in the window."
3,13,ED,"This is spooky, man. This place..."
3,13,CORBETT,"Okay. Oh, no!"
3,13,DEAN,Freeze! police officers! don't move!
3,13,SAM,"All right. All right. All right. Take it easy, take it easy."
3,13,DEAN,Let's see some identification.
3,13,SAM,Come on. Let's see some i.d.
3,13,CORBETT,What -- are we under -- under arrest?
3,13,ED,We are unarmed.
3,13,CORBETT,"Oh, god. Oh, god."
3,13,DEAN,"Want to explain that weirdo outfit, Mr., uh, Corbett?"
3,13,ED,I know you.
3,13,DEAN,"Yeah, sure you do. Give me some identification."
3,13,ED,"Yeah, ho-- whoa, hold on a second. I know the both of you guys. Yeah."
3,13,CORBETT,What?
3,13,ED,"Yeah, huh."
3,13,SAM,Holy [Bleep]!
3,13,DEAN,What?
3,13,SAM,"Uh, West Texas... the... the tulpa we had to take out. Those two goofballs that almost got us killed... The hellhounds or something?"
3,13,DEAN,[Bleep] me.
3,13,ED,"Yeah, we're not hellhounds anymore, okay? It didn't test that well."
3,13,CORBETT,"Ed, what's going on?"
3,13,ED,"They're not cops, buddy -- no, not at all."
3,13,DEAN,"Ed, Ed, you had a partner, too, didn't you -- A different guy?"
3,13,ED,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
3,13,DEAN,Is he around here somewhere?
3,13,ED,"He's running around, chasing ghosts."
3,13,DEAN,"Okay, well, listen, you and Rambo need to get your girlfriends and get out of here."
3,13,ED,"All right. Listen here, chisel chest, okay? We were here first. We've already set up base camp. We beat you."
3,13,ED,Mm hmm.
3,13,ED,"Oh, god."
3,13,DEAN,Ed...
3,13,ED,Yeah?
3,13,DEAN,...where's your partner?
3,13,HARRY,"10.6. 10.7, guys. The EMF is really spiking here."
3,13,MAGGIE,"Temperature's down, like, 11 degrees."
3,13,HARRY,"All right, all right, keep your eyes peeled. This could be it. Maggie, can I get a reading in here, please?"
3,13,SPRUCE,Something keeps messing with the chip. I don't know what's going on here.
3,13,SPRUCE,Guys. Guys. Guys.
3,13,DEAN,"What are you doing in the Morton House, Ed - on leap year -- what are you thinking?"
3,13,ED,"We're here to spend the night, okay? It's for our TV show."
3,13,SAM,What? Great. Perfect.
3,13,CORBETT,"Yeah, nobody's ever spent the night before."
3,13,DEAN,"Uh, actually, yeah, they have."
3,13,ED,"Uh, we've never heard of them."
3,13,DEAN,"Yeah, you know why? 'Cause the ones that have haven't lived to talk about it!"
3,13,ED,"Oh, come on, I don't believe you."
3,13,SAM,"Look -- missing-persons reports going back almost a half century. John Graham stayed on a dare -- gone. Julie Wilkerson -- gone. There are tons more. All of them came to just stay the night through, always on a leap year.  The only body they ever found was the last owner, Freeman Daggett."
3,13,ED,These look legit.
3,13,SAM,"They are legit. Look, Ed, we ain't got much time here, buddy. Starting at midnight, your friends are going to die."
3,13,HARRY,"Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Guys! Guys! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! We got one! Corbett! Corbett, we saw one! We saw one!"
3,13,ED,Get outta here!
3,13,HARRY,It was a full apparition! It was like a class four. It was a spectral illumination! It...
3,13,MAGGIE,It was amazing!
3,13,ED,Yes.
3,13,DEAN,"All right, let's have this reunion across the street, guys."
3,13,HARRY,Crap. What are you guys doing here?
3,13,DEAN,"Come on, come on. We'll get you ice cream -- our treat. What do you say? Let's go."
3,13,HARRY,"Yeah, I say no."
3,13,MAGGIE,"Look at this. Look, look. Ed, Ed. No. No. Look at this. Okay, honest-to-god proof, all right?"
3,13,ED,Are you kidding me?
3,13,HARRY,"Yeah. no, not kidding."
3,13,SPRUCE,What kind of reading did we get?
3,13,HARRY,"Uh, it was a 10.9."
3,13,ED,10.9?
3,13,HARRY,"Yeah, it was 10.9. It was almost 11. I came out, and I was like, ""what's going on?"" And I was like -- wait, watch this. Oh! He got blasted. It was crazy."
3,13,SAM,"Think we were off on this? I mean, that was just a death echo."
3,13,DEAN,"Yeah, but what's it doing here? Did anybody get shot here?"
3,13,SAM,"No, not that I could find."
3,13,SPRUCE,What's a death echo?
3,13,SAM,"Look, we got a problem here. That ghost ain't it."
3,13,HARRY,"Yeah, that's real. Like, that happened."
3,13,SPRUCE,What's a death echo?
3,13,DEAN,"Echoes are trapped in a loop, okay? They keep replaying how they died over and over and over again, usually in the place where they were ganked. It's about as dangerous as a scary movie."
3,13,SAM,"So maybe the echo's not dangerous, but maybe something else is."
3,13,DEAN,"You're right. All right, we need to get out of here, guys. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Pack it up."
3,13,SAM,"Guys, time is running out!"
3,13,DEAN,We're moving!
3,13,MAGGIE,What about all of our equipment? What are we gonna...
3,13,DEAN,Lots of fun. Let's go.
3,13,HARRY,We got more material. We got all kinds of stuff. We'll make you guys recurring guest stars.
3,13,ED,Wait! Wait!! Where's Corbett?
3,13,CORBETT,I wish to communicate with the restless spirits here.
3,13,CORBETT,"Uh, lights out? Oh, I think I got night vision here."
3,13,CORBETT,That's better.
3,13,ED,No man left behind.
3,13,ED,That was Corbett.
3,13,HARRY,That was Corbett! Corbett!
3,13,MAGGIE,Corbett! it's okay!
3,13,DEAN,We'll get him! Go back!
3,13,SAM,Guys! [Bleep]!
3,13,CORBETT,Let me go!! Guys!!!
3,13,ED,"Corbett, you need to come back, Corbett."
3,13,CORBETT (Screaming),No!!!!
3,13,DEAN,Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on.
3,13,SAM,Corbett's... He's not here. Let's go. Let's go.
3,13,HARRY,"No. No. No. But that's Corbett. No, that was Corbett. Didn't you hear that?"
3,13,DEAN,"Go, go, go, come on."
3,13,SAM,Guys. Guys. Guys. He's that way.
3,13,SAM,Here we go. Here we go. Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
3,13,ED,Corbett?
3,13,SAM,"Hey, hey, hey. Watch him. Watch him."
3,13,ED,"Oh, god, what's happened? Oh, god. He's gone. He just disappeared."
3,13,HARRY,"Okay, let's just go through all the angles. Let's go through all the cameras we have."
3,13,DEAN,"Yeah, I am happy."
3,13,SAM,"""Let's go hunt the Morton house,"" you said, ""it's our Grand Canyon."""
3,13,DEAN,"Sam, I don't want to hear this."
3,13,SAM,"You got two months left, Dean. Instead, we're gonna die tonight."
3,13,SPRUCE,Whoa! what the hell is going on guys?
3,13,SAM,"I'll tell you what's going on. Every door, every window, I'm guessing every exit out of this house -- they're all sealed."
3,13,MAGGIE,But w-why are they sealed?
3,13,DEAN,"It's a supernatural lockdown, okay? Whatever took Corbett doesn't want us to leave, and it's no death echo. This is a bad mother, and it wants us scared."
3,13,MAGGIE,Or it just wants us.
3,13,SPRUCE,"Uh, guys, the camera's fritzing again."
3,13,ED,"Whoa. Whoa. Guys, the EMF's starting to spike. This is a big one!"
3,13,SAM,"Everybody, stay close. There's something coming."
3,13,ALL,Whoa!!!
3,13,DEAN,Is this the same echo you guys saw earlier?
3,13,HARRY,"No, it's a different guy."
3,13,DEAN,Multiple echoes? What the hell's going on?
3,13,SAM,Beats me.
3,13,DEAN,Okay. All right. All right. All right.
3,13,DEAN,"Uh, hey, buddy! Hey. Hey. Wake up. You're dead! Hello!"
3,13,HARRY,What's he doing? What's he doing?
3,13,SAM,"It's rare, but sometimes you can shock an echo out of its loop if you can talk to the part of the ghost that's still human, but usually you have to have some kind of connection to the deceased."
3,13,DEAN,Come on! Wake up! Be dead!
3,13,HARRY,You guys hear that?
3,13,ED,What's that sound?
3,13,HARRY,You guys hear that?
3,13,DEAN,"Snap out of it, buddy, huh? Come on, what are you waiting for? You're gonzo! You're dead!"
3,13,HARRY,Where the hell did it go?
3,13,DEAN,"Dude, there's no records of any of this here. No one got shot here. Obviously, no one got run over by a freaking train."
3,13,SAM,Stay close.
3,13,MAGGIE,Did the echoes take Corbett?
3,13,DEAN,"Yes. No. I don't know. We don't know what's doing what here; that's what we're trying to figure out, okay?"
3,13,SAM,"All right, stay close. Okay, look, um, death echoes are ghosts, okay? Now, ghosts -- they usually haunt places where they lived or where they died."
3,13,DEAN,Except these mooks didn't live or die here.
3,13,SAM,Right.
3,13,MAGGIE,"So, what are they doing here?"
3,13,DEAN,"Hey, give the lady a cigar. All right, seriously, does looking at this nightmare through that camera make you feel better or something? I mean..."
3,13,MAGGIE,"Um...I, uh... Well, yeah. Uh, yeah. I think so."
3,13,DEAN,Oh.
3,13,DEAN,He was a doctor?
3,13,SAM,Janitor.
3,13,DEAN,This looks like his den. When'd you say he died -- '64?
3,13,SAM,"Yeah, heart attack."
3,13,MAGGIE,"What are these, c-rations?"
3,13,DEAN,"Yeah, army-issued, three squares -- like a lifetime supply."
3,13,MAGGIE,"God, is that all he ate?"
3,13,DEAN,One-stop shopping.
3,13,DEAN,"Hello, locked."
3,13,ED,"Oh, come on, guys. This is ridiculous. I mean, how the hell is this supposed to find Corbett, huh? We should be digging up the friggin' floorboards right now."
3,13,DEAN,"(Leafing through file box)
Crap. Crap. Taxidermy. Okay. You said Daggett was a hospital janitor?"
3,13,SAM,Yeah.
3,13,DEAN,"Ewww. Got three toe tags here -- one, death by gunshots, train accident, and suicide."
3,13,SAM,Ewwwwww!
3,13,HARRY,What?
3,13,SAM,"Well, that explains why all the death echoes are here. They're here because their bodies are here...somewhere in the house?"
3,13,DEAN,Daggett brought the remains home from the morgue. To *play*.
3,13,SPRUCE,"That's nasty, dude."
3,13,SAM,Right.
3,13,DEAN,Wait a minute.
3,13,MAGGIE,Corbett.
3,13,MAGGIE,"Okay, Maggie."
3,13,DEAN,"Closer to the herd, okay?"
3,13,HARRY,Maggie? Maggie?
3,13,DEAN,She's fine.
3,13,ED,"Harry. Harry, I got an 8.6 and climbing fast. Something huge is coming. Look. Something big is coming."
3,13,HARRY,"It's past 11, you guys."
3,13,DEAN,What? Nobody move! Hold on. Hold on. Stay quiet.
3,13,ED,It's really cold in here.
3,13,MAGGIE,Harry?
3,13,DEAN,Sam?
3,13,ED,Some kind of surge.
3,13,DEAN,Sam???
3,13,SPRUCE,Where'd he go?
3,13,MAGGIE,"Oh, no."
3,13,DEAN,Sam!!!!!!!!!!
3,13,DEAN,Sammy!!!!!!!!!
3,13,ED,Corbett! Sam!
3,13,HARRY,Corbett! Talk to us!
3,13,DEAN,Sam!
3,13,DEAN,Sam!!!
3,13,MAGGIE,"God, I am so scared. I'm so scared."
3,13,HARRY,"It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay, Maggie."
3,13,ED,Corbett!
3,13,ED,My best friend... And my best sister.
3,13,HARRY,Ed.
3,13,ED,Harry.
3,13,HARRY,Ed.
3,13,ED,Harry.
3,13,HARRY,"Ed. listen, Ed."
3,13,HARRY,Are you banging my sister?
3,13,HARRY,No! No!
3,13,SPRUCE,You got it.
3,13,HARRY,Ed.
3,13,HARRY,Ed! Ed! Ed! Ed! Ed!
3,13,SPRUCE,Guys!
3,13,MAGGIE,Get off Harry!
3,13,DEAN,What the [Bleep] are you doing?! Cut it out! We're down by two people. Sam! Sammy!
3,13,MAGGIE,Great.
3,13,HARRY,Sorry.
3,13,ED,I'm sorry. Give me my glasses. Did he knock my -- my tooth there?
3,13,SPRUCE,"Uh, no."
3,13,ED,"I won that, right?"
3,13,SPRUCE,Yep. You're good.
3,13,HARRY,"Thanks, Spruce."
3,13,SPRUCE,"Yeah, it's my fault."
3,13,MAGGIE,That's real great. That's nice. Thanks.
3,13,CORBETT,Sam?
3,13,SAM,"Corbett, hey, you got to keep listening to my voice, okay? I'm right here. Stay awake."
3,13,DAGGETT (O.S.),Don't listen.
3,13,DAGGETT,"It stops hurting, so don't worry."
3,13,SAM,"Corbett, stay with me. Stay with me, you got it? I'm right here. Hey. Stay with me. Don't. Don't."
3,13,SAM,No. Corbett! No! Corbett!
3,13,HARRY,Corbett! Where'd you guys go?
3,13,MAGGIE,Where are you guys?
3,13,HARRY,"Dean, what are you doing?"
3,13,DEAN,"Okay, so Daggett was a cold war nut, okay? He was -- he was an amateur taxidermist. He liked to slow dance with cadavers, and all he ate were c-rations, so what the hell are we looking for?!"
3,13,MAGGIE,Horrible little life.
3,13,DEAN,"Yeah, a lonely life...A cold war life. He was scared. He was scared...he was scared."
3,13,HARRY,"Scared of what? What? Dean, where are you going?"
3,13,MAGGIE,"Wait, don't leave me in here, you guys."
3,13,SAM,Get away from me.
3,13,DAGGETT,This won't hurt. It's okay. It's okay. Relax. Relax.
3,13,MAGGIE,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?"
3,13,DEAN,"Guys like Daggett back then, the ones who were really scared of the Russkies -- they built bomb shelters. I'm guessing he's got one. I'll bet you it's in the basement."
3,13,HARRY,Whoa!
3,13,ED,Whoa! That is not funny!
3,13,SPRUCE,"Um, who closed the door?"
3,13,DEAN,It did. It wants to separate us.
3,13,ED,What?
3,13,DEAN,There's some salt in my duffel. Make a circle and get inside.
3,13,ED,Inside?
3,13,HARRY,That's stupid.
3,13,ED,Inside your duffel bag?
3,13,DEAN,"In the salt, you idiots!"
3,13,ED,"Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah."
3,13,ED,"Harry, hurry up. Get in the circle. Get in the circle. Come on. Come on. Quick, quick."
3,13,HARRY,"Guys, guys, I don't want to die, okay, and I don't want you to die."
3,13,ED,"Harry, listen -- listen to me, okay? listen. If we don't die... ...it's totally okay if you, uh, do my sister."
3,13,ED,Ow!
3,13,MAGGIE,Nice.
3,13,MAGGIE,"Hey guys, hey guys, it's coming again."
3,13,ED,"Oh, god. Oh, OK. Guys. Get in close."
3,13,HARRY,"Oh, god."
3,13,ED,"Oh god, oh god."
3,13,ED,"Oh. Oh, c-Corbett."
3,13,DEAN,What?
3,13,SPRUCE,"Earlier, you and Sam -- he said you had two months left?"
3,13,DEAN,"Yeah, it's complicated. A while ago, Sam... No. No. No. I'm not gonna whine about my [Bleep] problems to some [Bleep] reality show. I'm gonna do my [Bleep] job."
3,13,SPRUCE,Is it cancer?
3,13,DEAN,Shut up. You hear that?
3,13,DAGGETT,"I've been waiting for some more friends. I get lonely. But you're coming to my party, aren't you?"
3,13,SPRUCE,Is that music?
3,13,DEAN,"Yeah, it's coming from behind this wall."
3,13,SPRUCE,"Wow, you're strong."
3,13,DAGGETT,"You'll stay a good, long time."
3,13,DEAN,Sam!!
3,13,SPRUCE,Oh god.
3,13,SPRUCE,"Oh, no, Corbett."
3,13,ED,"Oh god, what have we done? Oh god."
3,13,HARRY,Ed. Ed.
3,13,ED,Yeah?
3,13,HARRY,Corbett's a -- he's a death echo. He's reliving his own murder.
3,13,MAGGIE,Over and over forever.
3,13,SPRUCE,What's this Daggett guy's problem anyway?
3,13,SAM,Loneliness.
3,13,DEAN,"What, he's never heard of a Realdoll?"
3,13,SAM,"No, no, no, Daggett was the Norman Bates, stuff-your-mother kind of lonely. I mean, that's why he lifted these bodies from the morgue, threw himself a birthday party, except they were the only ones who would come. Anyway, so, at midnight, he sealed them in the bomb shelter and went upstairs and o.d.'d on horse tranqs."
3,13,DEAN,How do you know this?
3,13,SAM,'Cause he told me.
3,13,DEAN,"Oh. yeah. Okay, so now that he's dead, what? Same song, different verse, trying to get people to come to his party?"
3,13,SAM,"Pretty much, yeah. Stay forever."
3,13,SPRUCE,Are those real bullets?
3,13,DEAN,It's rock salt.
3,13,ED,"Oh, no."
3,13,MAGGIE,Guys? Corbett...
3,13,ED,"Guys, it's -- it's Corbett. He's -- he's -- he's trapped. He's in a lot of pain, you know? We got to try and... we got to try and pull him out of his loop. We have to."
3,13,HARRY,Ed?
3,13,ED,"Corbett. Corbett, it's -- Oh, god."
3,13,HARRY,Don't cross the line of salt.
3,13,ED,"I gotta do it, Harry. Corbett, listen to me. Okay, I'm not gonna hurt you. Listen. Listen. Oh, god. Corbett. Oh."
3,13,HARRY,Get back!
3,13,ED,"oh, god. Whoa. Oh, I can't, okay? He's not hearing me, okay? He won't stop dying."
3,13,SAM,Seriously -- you're still shooting?
3,13,DEAN,It makes him feel better. Don't ask.
3,13,SPRUCE,"Ah, hell, guys. Get in your ghost-role thing. Something's coming."
3,13,HARRY,I...I know how we can get through to him.
3,13,ED,How?
3,13,HARRY,Ed... He had feelings for you.
3,13,ED,Huh?
3,13,HARRY,He wanted you.
3,13,ED,Wa-- wanted me to what?
3,13,HARRY,"You know. (HARRY demonstrates with a slight grunt and pelvic thrust). And you know what you've got to do. You can do it, Ed. You've always been the brave one. Yes, you can. You make us brave -- Maggie, right?"
3,13,MAGGIE,Yeah. Yeah you do. You totally do.
3,13,HARRY,"Ed...You got to go be gay for that poor, dead intern. You got to send him into the light."
3,13,ED,Corbett.
3,13,HARRY,"Maggie, no. no."
3,13,MAGGIE,It's okay.
3,13,ED,"Corbett, look. Hey, it's just Ed, buddy. It's just me. Hey, hey, Corbett, listen to me. Listen to me. I -- we... Okay. You meant... Corbett, you meant a lot to the team. You meant... You meant a lot to me. You know, never back down...Never say a bad word, okay? I remember that, Corbett. I-I remember that. I remember because I love you, Corbett. I really, truly love you. Do you remember that? do you?"
3,13,CORBETT,Hey. Ed?
3,13,ED,"Yeah. Yeah, Corbett, it's... Corbett, yeah, it's me. It's me. look at me. You got to help us, man. you have to help us, Corbett. Please. please. Please help us right now."
3,13,SAM,Take it easy. you all right?
3,13,SPRUCE,"Uh, guys..."
3,13,SPRUCE,This is bad -- very bad.
3,13,SPRUCE,Corbett?
3,13,SPRUCE,"You all right, dude?"
3,13,SPRUCE,You all right?
3,13,SAM,God.
3,13,ED (V.O.),"Leap year, February 29th, the Morton House. A tragic day. A day of souls bound in torment, of lives held in cruel balance. But the Ghostfacers, they did the best that they could."
3,13,HARRY,"We lost a beloved friend, but we gained new allies."
3,13,HARRY,The Ghostfacers were forced to face something far more scary than ghosts. They were forced to face themselves.
3,13,ED,War changes Man.
3,13,HARRY,And Maggie.
3,13,ED,"War changes man. And one woman... You know Corbett, we just... ah gosh, we just like to think that you're out there, watching over us."
3,13,HARRY,"As far as we're concerned, you're not an intern anymore. You have more than earned full Ghostfacer status. Plus, it would be cool to have a ghost on the team."
3,13,ED,"Yeah. Heh heh. And here we were thinking that, you know, we were teaching you and all this time you were teaching us, about heart, about dedication, and about how gay love can pierce through the veil of death and save the day. Thank you, Alan J. Corbett."
3,13,HARRY,"Go well into that starry night, young Turk. Go well."
3,13,CORBETT,"Come on, Spruce, I gotta get all this stuff packed up!"
3,13,SPRUCE,"So, pack and talk!"
3,13,CORBETT,I don't know what to say.
3,13,SPRUCE,"Say what comes to mind. This is one of our confessional moments, Corbett, so confess. What did you think was going to happen tonight? What do you think is going to happen on this trip?"
3,13,CORBETT,"I think tonight, I really do, I think all of our dreams are going to come true. Does that sound stupid?"
3,13,SPRUCE,"Kind of does, yeah."
3,13,ED,"So, guys, what do you think? Are you alright?"
3,13,DEAN,"You know, I kind of think it was half-awesome."
3,13,MAGGIE,"Half-awesome? That - that's full-on good, right?"
3,13,SAM,"Yeah, um, I mean it's bizarre how you all are able to honor Corbett's memory while grossly exploiting the manner of his death. Well done."
3,13,DEAN,Yeah. It's a real tight rope you guys are walking there.
3,13,SAM,"Yeah, all right guys."
3,13,ED,"Nah, that's reality, man. Yeah, Corbett gave his life searching for the truth, and it's our job over here to share it with the world."
3,13,SAM,"Right. Well, um, our experience, you know what you get when you show the world the truth?"
3,13,DEAN,A straitjacket. Or a punch in the face. Sometimes both.
3,13,SAM,Right.
3,13,HARRY,"Oh come on, guys, don't be 'facer haters just because we happen to have gotten the footage of the century."
3,13,ED,Oh yeah.
3,13,DEAN,You got us there.
3,13,SAM,Yeah.
3,13,DEAN,"Yeah, well we'll see you guys around."
3,13,SPRUCE,Peace out.
3,13,HARRY,Dicks.
3,13,ED,Oh yeah.
3,13,MAGGIE,Totally.
3,13,SPRUCE,Let's start laying off some DVDs.
3,13,ED,"Sounds like a good idea, Spruce."
3,13,HARRY,"You know guys, I think we're gonna need a bigger office here, you know? Because we're going to go national, and then it's going to go international, and then-"
3,13,ED,"Hey, Menudo left their dance bag behind. What's inside, huh?"
3,13,HARRY,Whoa. What the hell is this?
3,13,SPRUCE,Uh...seems to be having some technical difficulty over here.
3,13,HARRY,"Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
3,13,ED,"No, no!"
3,13,HARRY,"Wait, wait!!! No operating system found?!?!?! Wait a minute!!"
3,13,SAM,We clean?
3,13,DEAN,Electromagnet wiped out every tape and hard drive that they have.
3,13,SAM,The world just isn't ready for the Ghostfacers.
3,13,DEAN,It's too bad. I kinda liked the show.
3,13,SAM,It had its moments.
3,13,ED (V.O.),That is money in the bank!
3,14,DEAN,Hello?
4,1,TITLE CARD:,THE ROAD SO FAR
4,1,TITLE CARD:,NOW
4,1,TITLE CARD:,SUPERNATURAL
4,1,DEAN,(hoarse) Hello?
4,1,DEAN,September.
4,1,FLASHBACK,DEAN's chest is ripped apart by the Hellhounds (3.16)
4,1,PRESENT,"DEAN stares at his unblemished, unscarred chest in the dingy gas station mirror. He turns his left shoulder to the mirror and pulls up the sleeve to reveal a large, raw HANDPRINT BRAND."
4,1,RECORDED VOICE,We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected.
4,1,BOBBY (V.O.),Yeah?
4,1,DEAN,Bobby?
4,1,BOBBY (V.O.),Yeah?
4,1,DEAN,It's me.
4,1,BOBBY (V.O.),Who's “me”?
4,1,DEAN,Dean.
4,1,BOBBY (V.O.),Who is this?
4,1,DEAN,"Bobby, listen to me."
4,1,BOBBY (V.O.),"This ain't funny. Call again, I'll kill ya."
4,1,DEAN,Surprise.
4,1,BOBBY,"I, I don't..."
4,1,DEAN,"Yeah, me neither. (He enters.) But here I am."
4,1,DEAN,Bobby! It's me!
4,1,BOBBY,My ass!
4,1,DEAN,"(shoves a chair between himself and BOBBY, holds his hands out) Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait! Your name is Robert Steven Singer. You became a hunter after your wife got possessed, and... you're about the closest thing I have to a father. Bobby. It's me."
4,1,DEAN,I am not a shapeshifter!
4,1,BOBBY,Then you're a Revenant!
4,1,DEAN,"Alright. If I was either, could I do this – with a silver knife?"
4,1,BOBBY,(starting to believe it) Dean?
4,1,DEAN,That's what I've been trying to tell you.
4,1,BOBBY,"It's... It's good to see you, boy."
4,1,DEAN,"Yeah, you too."
4,1,BOBBY,But... how did you bust out?
4,1,DEAN,"I don't know. I just, uh, I just woke up in a pine box..."
4,1,DEAN,"I'm not a demon either, you know."
4,1,BOBBY,Sorry. Can't be too careful.
4,1,BOBBY,But... that don't make a lick of sense.
4,1,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, you're preachin' to the choir."
4,1,DEAN,"I know, I should look like a Thriller video reject."
4,1,BOBBY,What do you remember?
4,1,DEAN,"Not much. I remember I was a Hellhound's chew toy, and then... lights out. Then I come to six feet under, that was it. (BOBBY sits.) Sam's number's not working. He's, uh... he's not..."
4,1,BOBBY,"Oh, he's alive. As far as I know."
4,1,DEAN,"Good.... Wait, what do you mean, as far as you know?"
4,1,BOBBY,I haven't talked to him for months.
4,1,DEAN,"You're kidding, you just let him go off by himself?"
4,1,BOBBY,He was dead set on it.
4,1,DEAN,"Bobby, you should've been looking after him."
4,1,BOBBY,"I tried. These last months haven't been exactly easy, you know. For him or me. We had to bury you."
4,1,DEAN,"Why did you bury me, anyway?"
4,1,BOBBY,I wanted you salted and burned. Usual drill. But... Sam wouldn't have it.
4,1,DEAN,"Well, I'm glad he won that one."
4,1,BOBBY,He said you'd need a body when he got you back home somehow. That's about all he said.
4,1,DEAN,(suspicious) What do you mean?
4,1,BOBBY,"He was quiet. Real quiet. And then he just took off. Wouldn't return my calls. I tried to find him, but he didn't want to be found."
4,1,DEAN,"Oh, damnit, Sammy."
4,1,BOBBY,What?
4,1,DEAN,"Oh, he got me home okay. But whatever he did, it is bad mojo."
4,1,BOBBY,What makes you so sure?
4,1,DEAN,"You should have seen the grave site. It was like a nuke went off. And then there was this... this force, this presence, I don't know, but it, it blew past me at a fill-up joint. And then this. (He strips his jacket, pulls up his sleeve to reveal the brand.)"
4,1,BOBBY,(standing) What in the hell?
4,1,DEAN,It was like a demon just yanked me out. Or rode me out.
4,1,BOBBY,But why?
4,1,DEAN,To hold up their end of the bargain.
4,1,BOBBY,You think Sam made a deal.
4,1,DEAN,It's what I would have done.
4,1,DEAN,"(into the phone) Yeah, hi, I have a cell phone account with you guys, and uh, I lost my phone. I was wondering if you could turn the GPS on for me. (beat) Yeah. Name's Wedge Antilles. (beat) Social is 2-4-7-4. (beat) Thank you."
4,1,BOBBY,How'd you know he'd use that name?
4,1,DEAN,You kiddin' me? What don't I know about that kid?
4,1,DEAN,"(picking up one of the many empty liquor bottles scattered around) Hey, Bobby? What's the deal with the liquor store? What, are your parents out of town or something?"
4,1,BOBBY,Like I said. Last few months ain't been all that easy.
4,1,DEAN,(holds his gaze for a moment) Right.
4,1,DEAN,"Sam's in Pontiac, Illinois."
4,1,BOBBY,Right near where you were planted.
4,1,DEAN,"Right where I popped up. Hell of a coincidence, don't you think?"
4,1,DEAN,"(looks at BOBBY, confused) Where's what?"
4,1,DEAN,I think we got the wrong room.
4,1,SAM,"Hey, is..."
4,1,DEAN,"(quietly, with much feeling) Heya, Sammy."
4,1,SAM,(shouting) Who are you?!
4,1,DEAN,Like you didn't do this?!
4,1,SAM,Do what?!
4,1,SAM,(stares at DEAN as the struggle slowly goes out of his body) What...
4,1,DEAN,"(advancing cautiously, staring at SAM) I know. I look fantastic, huh?"
4,1,SAM,(like he's just remembered that she's there) What? No. No. He's my brother.
4,1,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Sorry."
4,1,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, sure thing, Kathy."
4,1,SAM,Right.
4,1,DEAN,"So tell me, what'd it cost?"
4,1,SAM,"(smiling) The girl? I don't pay, Dean."
4,1,SAM,You think I made a deal?
4,1,BOBBY,That's exactly what we think.
4,1,SAM,"Well, I didn't."
4,1,DEAN,(intensely) Don't lie to me.
4,1,SAM,I'm not lying.
4,1,DEAN,"(advancing) So what now, I'm off the hook and you're on, is that it? You're some demon's bitch-boy? I didn't want to be saved like this."
4,1,SAM,"(standing, angrily) Look, Dean, I wish I had done it, all right?"
4,1,DEAN,(grabs SAM by the front of his shirt) There's no other way that this could have gone down. Now tell the truth!
4,1,SAM,"(breaking DEAN'S grip) I tried everything. That's the truth. I tried opening the Devil's Gate. Hell, I tried to bargain, Dean, but no demon would deal, all right? You were rotting in Hell for months. For months, and I couldn't stop it. So I'm sorry it wasn't me, all right? Dean, I'm sorry."
4,1,DEAN,"(relenting) It's okay, Sammy. You don't have to apologize, I believe you."
4,1,BOBBY,"Don't get me wrong, I'm gladdened that Sam's soul remains intact, but it does raise a sticky question."
4,1,DEAN,"If he didn't pull me out, then what did?"
4,1,DEAN,So what were you doing around here if you weren't digging me out of my grave?
4,1,SAM,"Well, once I figured out I couldn't save you, I started hunting down Lilith, trying to get some payback."
4,1,SAM,"Uh, yeah, I'm sorry, Bobby. I should have called. I was pretty messed up."
4,1,DEAN,Oh yeah. I really feel your pain.
4,1,SAM,"Anyways, uh, I was checking these demons out of Tennessee, and out of nowhere they took a hard left, booked up here."
4,1,DEAN,When?
4,1,SAM,Yesterday morning.
4,1,DEAN,When I busted out.
4,1,BOBBY,You think these demons are here 'cause of you?
4,1,SAM,But why?
4,1,DEAN,"Well, I don't know – some badass demon drags me out and now this? It's gotta be connected somehow."
4,1,BOBBY,"How you feelin', anyway?"
4,1,DEAN,I'm a little hungry.
4,1,BOBBY,"No, I mean, do you feel like yourself? Anything strange, or different?"
4,1,DEAN,"Or demonic? Bobby, how many times do I have to prove I'm me?"
4,1,BOBBY,"Yeah. Well, listen. No demon's letting you loose out of the goodness of their hearts. They've gotta have something nasty planned."
4,1,DEAN,"Well, I feel fine."
4,1,SAM,"Okay, look, we don't know what they're planning. We got a pile of questions and no shovel. We need help."
4,1,BOBBY,"I know a psychic. A few hours from here. Something this big, maybe she's heard the other side talking."
4,1,DEAN,"Hell yeah, it's worth a shot."
4,1,BOBBY,I'll be right back
4,1,SAM,"Hey, wait. (stands) You probably want this back."
4,1,DEAN,Thanks.
4,1,DEAN,"What, Hell?  I don't know, I, I must have blacked it out. I don't remember a damn thing."
4,1,DEAN,Yeah.
4,1,FLASHBACK,"Closeup of DEAN'S bloody, terrified face, with screams and eerie sounds."
4,1,PRESENT,"DEAN pulls back from the mirror, blinking in confusion."
4,1,BOBBY,She's about four hours down the Interstate. Try to keep up.
4,1,SAM,I assume you'll want to drive.
4,1,DEAN,What the hell is that?
4,1,SAM,That's an iPod jack.
4,1,DEAN,"You were supposed to take care of her, not douche her up."
4,1,SAM,"Dean, I thought it was my car."
4,1,DEAN,Really?
4,1,DEAN,There's still one thing that's bothering me.
4,1,SAM,Yeah?
4,1,SAM,"Well, she tried. She couldn't."
4,1,DEAN,"What do you mean, she couldn't?"
4,1,SAM,"She fired this, like, burning light at me, and... didn't leave a scratch. Like I was immune or something."
4,1,DEAN,Immune?
4,1,SAM,"Yeah. I don't know who was more surprised, her or me. She left pretty fast after that."
4,1,DEAN,"Huh. What about Ruby, where is she?"
4,1,SAM,Dead. For now.
4,1,SAM,No.
4,1,DEAN,"You sure about that? Well, I mean, now that you've got... immunity, whatever the hell that is... just wondering what other kind of weirdo crap you've got going on."
4,1,SAM,"Nothing, Dean. Look, you didn't want me to go down that road, so I didn't go down that road. It was practically your dying wish."
4,1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, let's keep it that way."
4,1,PAMELA,Bobby!
4,1,BOBBY,You're a sight for sore eyes.
4,1,PAMELA,"So, these the boys?"
4,1,BOBBY,"Sam, Dean. This is Pamela Barnes, best damn psychic in the state."
4,1,PAMELA,"Mmm-mmm-mmm. Dean Winchester. Out of the fire and back in the frying pan, huh? Makes you a rare individual."
4,1,DEAN,If you say so.
4,1,PAMELA,Come on in.
4,1,BOBBY,"So, you hear anything?"
4,1,PAMELA,"Well, I Ouija'd my way through a dozen spirits. No one seems to know who broke your boy out, or why."
4,1,BOBBY,So what's next?
4,1,PAMELA,"A séance, I think. See if we can see who did the deed."
4,1,BOBBY,You're not gonna... summon the damn thing here.
4,1,PAMELA,No. I just want to get a sneak peek at it. Like a crystal ball without the crystal.
4,1,DEAN,I'm game.
4,1,DEAN,Who's Jesse?
4,1,DEAN,His loss.
4,1,PAMELA,Might be your gain.
4,1,DEAN,"Dude, I am so in."
4,1,SAM,"Yeah, she's gonna eat you alive."
4,1,DEAN,"Hey, I just got out of jail. Bring it."
4,1,DEAN,You are NOT invited.
4,1,LATER,"PAMELA, BOBBY, SAM, and DEAN are seated around the small table, which now has six lighted candles in the center."
4,1,DEAN,"Whoa. Well, he didn't touch me there."
4,1,PAMELA,My mistake.
4,1,DEAN,Castiel?
4,1,PAMELA,I can't see! I can't see! Oh god!
4,1,WAITRESS,Be up in a jiff.
4,1,SAM,(into the phone) You bet. (he sits)
4,1,DEAN,What'd Bobby say?
4,1,SAM,Pam's stable. And out of I.C.U.
4,1,DEAN,"And blind, because of us."
4,1,SAM,And we still have no clue who we're dealing with.
4,1,DEAN,That's not entirely true.
4,1,SAM,No?
4,1,DEAN,"We got a name. Castiel, or whatever. With the right mumbo-jumbo we could summon him, bring him right to us."
4,1,SAM,You're crazy. Absolutely not.
4,1,DEAN,"We'll work him over. I mean, after what he did?"
4,1,SAM,"Pam took a peek at him and her eyes burned out of her skull, and you want to have a face to face?"
4,1,DEAN,You got a better idea?
4,1,SAM,"Yeah, as a matter of fact I do. I followed some demons to town, right?"
4,1,DEAN,Okay.
4,1,SAM,"So, we go find them. Someone's gotta know something about something."
4,1,SAM,Thanks.
4,1,DEAN,You angling for a tip?
4,1,WAITRESS,I'm sorry. Thought you were looking for us.
4,1,DEMON WAITRESS,(eyes going back to normal) Dean. To hell and back. Aren't you a lucky duck.
4,1,DEAN,That's me.
4,1,DEMON WAITRESS,"So you get to just stroll out of the pit, huh? Tell me. What makes you so special?"
4,1,DEAN,"I like to think it's because of my perky nipples. I don't know. Wasn't my doing, I don't know who pulled me out."
4,1,DEMON WAITRESS,Right. You don't.
4,1,DEAN,No. I don't.
4,1,DEMON WAITRESS,"Lying's a sin, you know."
4,1,DEAN,"I'm not lying. But I'd like to find out, so if you wouldn't mind enlightening me, Flo..."
4,1,DEMON WAITRESS,"Mind your tone with me, boy. I'll drag you back to hell myself."
4,1,DEAN,"No, you won't."
4,1,DEMON WAITRESS,No?
4,1,DEAN,"No. Because if you were you would have done it already. Fact is, you don't know who cut me loose. And you're just as spooked as we are. And you're looking for answers. Well, maybe it was some turbo-charged spirit. Or, uh, Godzilla. Or some big bad boss demon. I'm guessing at your pay grade that they don't tell you squat. Because whoever it was, they want me out. And they're a lot stronger than you. So go ahead. Send me back. But don't come crawling to me when they show up on your front doorstep with some Vaseline and a fire hose."
4,1,DEMON WAITRESS,I'm going to reach down your throat and rip out your lungs.
4,1,DEAN,"That's what I thought. Let's go, Sam."
4,1,DEAN,For the pie.
4,1,DEAN,"Holy crap, that was close."
4,1,SAM,"We're not just going to leave them in there, are we, Dean?"
4,1,DEAN,"Well yeah, there's three of them, probably more, and we've only got one knife between us."
4,1,SAM,I've been killing a lot more demons than that lately.
4,1,DEAN,Not anymore – the smarter brother's back in town.
4,1,SAM,"Dean, we've got to take 'em. They are dangerous."
4,1,DEAN,They're scared. Okay? Scared of whatever had the juice to yank me out. We're dealing with a bad mofo here. One job at a time.
4,1,BOBBY,Dean!
4,1,BOBBY,"How you doin', kid?"
4,1,DEAN,"Aside from the church bells ringing in my head, peachy."
4,1,SAM (PHONE),Hey.
4,1,DEAN (PHONE),What are you doing?
4,1,SAM,"Couldn't sleep, went to get a burger."
4,1,DEAN,In my car?
4,1,SAM,"Force of habit, sorry. What are you doing up?"
4,1,SAM,"All right, well, uh, spill some for me, huh?"
4,1,BOBBY,Why the hell didn't you tell him?
4,1,DEAN,Because he just tried to stop us.
4,1,BOBBY,From what?
4,1,BOBBY,You can't be serious!
4,1,DEAN,"As a heart attack. It's high noon, baby."
4,1,BOBBY,"Well, we don't know what it is. It could be a demon, it could be anything."
4,1,BOBBY,This is a bad idea.
4,1,DEAN,"Yeah, I couldn't agree more, but what other choice do we have?"
4,1,BOBBY,We could choose life.
4,1,DEAN,"Bobby, whatever this is, whatever it wants, it's after me. That much we know, right? I've got no place to hide. I can either get caught with my pants down again, or we can make our stand."
4,1,BOBBY,"Dean, we could use Sam on this."
4,1,DEAN,"Nah, he's better off where he is."
4,1,SAM,Your eyes.
4,1,DEMON WAITRESS,I can still smell your soul a mile away.
4,1,SAM,It was here. You saw it.
4,1,SAM,What was it?
4,1,DEMON WAITRESS,It's the end. We're dead. We're all dead.
4,1,DEMON WAITRESS,Go to hell.
4,1,SAM,Funny. I was going to say the same thing to you.
4,1,SAM,Damn it.
4,1,SAM,"What the hell is going on around here, Ruby?"
4,1,RUBY,I wish I knew.
4,1,SAM,We were thinking some high level demon pulled Dean out.
4,1,RUBY,"No way. Sam, human souls don't just walk out of Hell and back into their bodies easy. The sky bleeds, the ground quakes. It's cosmic. No demon can swing that. Not Lilith, not anybody."
4,1,SAM,Then what can?
4,1,RUBY,Nothing I've ever seen before.
4,1,BOBBY,Traps and talismans from every faith on the globe. How you doin?
4,1,DEAN,"Stakes, iron, silver, salt, knife. I mean, we're pretty much set to catch and kill anything I've ever heard of."
4,1,BOBBY,This is still a bad idea.
4,1,DEAN,"Yeah, Bobby, I heard you the first ten times. What do you say we ring the dinner bell?"
4,1,RUBY,"So. Million dollar question, are you going to tell Dean about what we're doing?"
4,1,RUBY,"Sam, he's going to find out, and if it's not from you he's going to be pissed."
4,1,SAM,"He's going to be pissed anyway. I mean, he's so hardheaded about this psychic stuff he'll just try and stop me."
4,1,RUBY,Look. Maybe I'll just take a step back for a while.
4,1,SAM,"Ruby, you..."
4,1,RUBY,"I mean, I'm not exactly in your brother's fanclub. But he is your brother, and I'm not going to come between you."
4,1,SAM,"I don't know if what I'm doing is right. Hell, I don't even know if I trust you."
4,1,RUBY,Thanks.
4,1,SAM,But what I do know is that I'm saving people. And stopping demons. And that feels good.  I want to keep going.
4,1,DEAN,"Wishful thinking, but maybe it's just the wind."
4,1,DEAN,Who are you?
4,1,CASTIEL,I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.
4,1,DEAN,Yeah. Thanks for that.
4,1,CASTIEL,"We need to talk, Dean. Alone."
4,1,CASTIEL,Your friend's alive.
4,1,DEAN,Who are you?
4,1,CASTIEL,Castiel.
4,1,CASTIEL,I'm an Angel of the Lord.
4,1,DEAN,Get the hell out of here. There's no such thing.
4,1,CASTIEL,"This is your problem, Dean. You have no faith."
4,1,DEAN,Some angel you are. You burned out that poor woman's eyes.
4,1,CASTIEL,"I warned her not to spy on my true form. It can be... overwhelming to humans, and so can my real voice. But you already knew that."
4,1,DEAN,"You mean the gas station and the motel. That was you talking? (CASTIEL nods.) Buddy, next time, lower the volume."
4,1,CASTIEL,"That was my mistake. Certain people, special people, can perceive my true visage. I thought you would be one of them. I was wrong."
4,1,DEAN,"And what visage are you in now, huh? What, holy tax accountant?"
4,1,CASTIEL,This? This is... a vessel.
4,1,DEAN,You're possessing some poor bastard?
4,1,CASTIEL,"He's a devout man, he actually prayed for this."
4,1,DEAN,"Well, I'm not buying what you're selling, so who are you really?"
4,1,CASTIEL,(frowning) I told you.
4,1,DEAN,Right. And why would an angel rescue me from Hell?
4,1,CASTIEL,"Good things do happen, Dean."
4,1,DEAN,Not in my experience.
4,1,CASTIEL,What's the matter? You don't think you deserve to be saved?
4,1,DEAN,Why'd you do it?
4,1,CASTIEL,Because God commanded it. Because we have work for you.
4,1,CASTIEL,Your friend is alive.
4,1,DEAN,Who are you?
4,1,CASTIEL,Castiel.
4,1,CASTIEL,I'm an Angel of the Lord.
4,1,DEAN,Get the hell out of here. There's no such thing.
4,1,CASTIEL,"This is your problem, Dean. You have no faith."
4,1,DEAN,Some angel you are. You burned out that poor woman's eyes.
4,1,CASTIEL,"I warned her not to spy on my true form. It can be... overwhelming to humans, and so can my real voice. But you already knew that."
4,1,DEAN,"You mean the gas station and the motel. (CASTIEL nods.) Buddy, next time, lower the volume."
4,1,CASTIEL,"That was my mistake. Certain people, special people, can perceive my true visage. I thought you would be one of them. I was wrong."
4,1,DEAN,"And what visage are you in now, huh? What, holy tax accountant?"
4,1,CASTIEL,This? This is... a vessel.
4,1,DEAN,You're possessing some poor bastard?
4,1,CASTIEL,"He's a devout man, he actually prayed for this."
4,1,DEAN,"Uh-huh. Y'know, it might've been easier to show up like this the first time instead of all the burning bush crap."
4,1,CASTIEL,Finding a human vessel durable enough to contain me... it's not easy.
4,1,DEAN,I have that same problem with women.
4,1,DEAN,"Look, pal, I'm not buying what you're selling, so who are you really?"
4,1,CASTIEL,(frowning) I told you.
4,1,DEAN,Right. And why would an angel rescue me from Hell?
4,1,CASTIEL,"Good things do happen, Dean."
4,1,DEAN,Not in my experience.
4,1,CASTIEL,What's the matter? You don't think you deserve to be saved?
4,1,DEAN,Why'd you do it?
4,1,CASTIEL,Because God commanded it. Because we have work for you.
4,7,SUBTITLE,Two Days Before Halloween
4,7,Two words,jail bait.
4,10,SAM,You want Anna? Why?
4,10,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, I know she's wiretapping your angel chats or whatever, but it's no reason to gank her."
4,10,URIEL,Don't worry. I'll kill her gentle.
4,10,DEAN,"You're some heartless sons of bitches, you know that?"
4,10,CASTIEL,"As a matter of fact, we are. And?"
4,10,SAM,And? Anna's an innocent girl.
4,10,CASTIEL,She is far from innocent.
4,10,SAM,What's that supposed to mean?
4,10,URIEL,It means she's worse than this abomination you've been screwing. Now give us the girl.
4,10,DEAN,Sorry. Get yourself another one. Try JDate.
4,10,URIEL,Who's gonna stop us? You two? Or this demon whore?
4,10,SAM,"Cas, stop...please."
4,10,URIEL,I've been waiting for this.
4,10,DEAN,What the...
4,10,DEAN,Come on.
4,10,DEAN,Anna. Anna!
4,10,ANNA,Are they -- are they gone?
4,10,DEAN,Did you kill them?
4,10,ANNA,No. I sent them away... far away.
4,10,DEAN,You want to tell me how?
4,10,ANNA,That just popped in my head. I don't know how I did it. I just did it.
4,10,DEAN,"So, what do you think?"
4,10,SAM,I think Anna's getting more interesting by the second.
4,10,DEAN,"Yeah, I agree. And what did they mean by ""she's not innocent""?"
4,10,SAM,"It seems like they want her bad, and not just 'cause of the angel radio thing. I mean, that blood spell --  Some serious crap, man."
4,10,SAM,What are you gonna do?
4,10,DEAN,"Anna may have sent the angels to the outfield, but, sooner or later, they're gonna be back. We got to get ourselves safe now."
4,10,DEAN,Iron walls drenched in salt. Demons can't even touch the joint.
4,10,RUBY,"Which I find racist, by the way."
4,10,DEAN,Write your congressman.
4,10,RUBY,Here.
4,10,DEAN,Hex bags?
4,10,RUBY,"Extra-crunchy. They'll hide us from angels, demons, all comers."
4,10,DEAN,"Thanks, Ruby. [ to ANNA ] Don't lose this. So, Anna, what's playing on angel radio? Anything useful?"
4,10,ANNA,It's quiet. Dead silence.
4,10,DEAN,Good. That's not troubling at all.
4,10,ANNA,"We're in trouble, huh? You guys are scared?"
4,10,DEAN,Nah.
4,10,DEAN,"Just stay here, okay? [ to RUBY ] Keep an eye on her."
4,10,DEAN,How's the car?
4,10,SAM,I got her. She's fine. Where's Bobby?
4,10,DEAN,"Uh, The Dominican. He said we break anything, we buy it."
4,10,DEAN,"God, I hope so. Otherwise, he's at hedonism in a banana hammock and a trucker cap."
4,10,SAM,Now that's seared in my brain.
4,10,DEAN,"All right, what did you find on Anna?"
4,10,SAM,"Uh, not much. Her parents were, uh, Rich and Amy Milton -- a church deacon and a housewife."
4,10,DEAN,No?
4,10,SAM,"When she was 2 1/2, she'd get hysterical any time her dad got close. She was convinced that he wasn't her real daddy."
4,10,DEAN,"Who was? The plumber, hmm? A little snaking the pipes?"
4,10,SAM,"Dude, you're confusing reality with porn again. Look, Anna didn't say. She just kept repeating that this real father of hers was mad. Very mad -- like wanted-to-kill-her mad."
4,10,DEAN,Kind of heavy for a 2-year-old.
4,10,SAM,"Well, she saw a kid's shrink, got better, and grew up normal."
4,10,DEAN,"Until now. So, what's she hiding?"
4,10,ANNA,Why don't you just ask me to my face?
4,10,DEAN,Nice job watching her.
4,10,RUBY,I'm watching her.
4,10,SAM,"No, you're right, Anna. Is there anything you want to tell us?"
4,10,ANNA,About what?
4,10,SAM,The angels said you were guilty of something. Why would they say that?
4,10,ANNA,You tell me. Tell me why my life has been leveled... Why my parents are dead. I don't know. I swear. I would give anything to know.
4,10,SAM,Okay. Then let's find out.
4,10,ANNA,How?
4,10,DEAN,We're here!
4,10,SAM,"Pamela, hey!"
4,10,SAM,Yeah.
4,10,SAM,I'm right here.
4,10,PAMELA,"Oh. Know how I can tell? [ grabs SAM's ass ] That perky little ass of yours. You could bounce a nickel off that thing. Of course I know it's you, grumpy. Same way I know that's a demon, and that poor girl's Anna and that you've been eyeing my rack."
4,10,SAM,Uh... uh... uh...
4,10,PAMELA,"Don't sweat it, kiddo. I still got more senses than most."
4,10,SAM,Got it.
4,10,PAMELA,"Hey, Anna. How are you? I'm Pamela."
4,10,ANNA,Hi.
4,10,PAMELA,Dean told me what's been going on. I'm excited to help.
4,10,ANNA,Oh. That's nice of you.
4,10,PAMELA,"Oh, well, not really. Any chance I can dick over an angel, I'm taking it."
4,10,ANNA,Why?
4,10,PAMELA,"They stole something from me. [ takes off her sunglasses, revealing white eyes ] Demon-y, I know. But they're just plastic. Good for business. Makes me look extra-psychic, don't you think? [ laughs ] Now...how about you tell me what your deal is? Hmm? Don't you worry."
4,10,PAMELA,"Nice and relaxed. Now, I'm going to count down from five to zero. When we're at zero, you'll be in a deep state of hypnosis. As I count down, just go deeper and deeper, okay? 5... 4... 3... 2... 1. Deep sleep. Deep sleep. Every muscle calm and relaxed. Can you hear me?"
4,10,ANNA,I can hear you.
4,10,PAMELA,"Now, Anna, tell me... How can you hear the angels? How did you work that spell?"
4,10,ANNA,I don't know. I just did.
4,10,PAMELA,Your father... What's his name?
4,10,ANNA,Rich Milton.
4,10,PAMELA,All right. But I want you to look further back... When you were very young... Just a couple of years old.
4,10,ANNA,I don't want to.
4,10,PAMELA,"It'll be okay. Anna, just one look -- that's all we need."
4,10,ANNA,No.
4,10,PAMELA,What's your dad's name? Your real dad. Why is he angry at you?
4,10,ANNA,No. No! No. [ screams ] No!
4,10,ANNA,[screams ] He's gonna kill me!
4,10,PAMELA,"Anna, you're safe."
4,10,ANNA,[ screams ] No! [ the lights explode and glass shatters ]
4,10,PAMELA,Calm down.
4,10,ANNA,[screams ] He's gonna kill me!
4,10,PAMELA,"It's all right, Anna."
4,10,DEAN,Anna?
4,10,PAMELA,"Dean, don't."
4,10,PAMELA,"Wake in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Anna... Anna? You all right?"
4,10,ANNA,"Thank you, Pamela. That helps a lot. I remember now."
4,10,SAM,Remember what?
4,10,ANNA,Who I am.
4,10,DEAN,I'll bite. Who are you?
4,10,ANNA,I'm an angel.
4,10,ANNA,"Don't be afraid, I'm not like the others."
4,10,RUBY,I don't find that very reassuring.
4,10,PAMELA,Neither do I.
4,10,SAM,You know them?
4,10,ANNA,We were kind of in the same foxhole.
4,10,DEAN,"So, what, were they like your bosses or something?"
4,10,ANNA,Try the other way around.
4,10,DEAN,Look at you.
4,10,PAMELA,But now they want to kill you?
4,10,ANNA,Orders are orders. I'm sure I have a death sentence on my head.
4,10,PAMELA,Why?
4,10,ANNA,"I disobeyed... which, for us, is about the worst thing you can do. I fell."
4,10,DEAN,Meaning?
4,10,PAMELA,"She fell to earth, became human."
4,10,SAM,"Wait a minute. I don't understand. So, angels can just become human?"
4,10,ANNA,It kind of hurts. Try cutting your kidney out with a butter knife. That kind of hurt. I ripped out my grace.
4,10,DEAN,Come again?
4,10,ANNA,"My grace. It's... energy. Hacked it out and fell. My mother, Amy, couldn't get pregnant. Always called me her little miracle. She had no idea how right she was."
4,10,DEAN,"So, you just forgot that you were God's little Power Ranger?"
4,10,ANNA,"The older I got, the longer I was human, yeah."
4,10,RUBY,I don't think you all appreciate how completely screwed we are.
4,10,ANNA,Ruby's right. Heaven wants me dead.
4,10,RUBY,"And Hell just wants her. A flesh-and-blood angel that you can question, torture, that bleeds. Sister, you're the Stanley Cup. And sooner or later, Heaven or Hell, they're gonna find you."
4,10,ANNA,I know. And that's why I'm gonna get it back.
4,10,SAM,What?
4,10,ANNA,My grace.
4,10,ANNA,If I can find it.
4,10,DEAN,"So, what, you're just gonna take some divine bong hit, and, shazam, you're Roma Downey?"
4,10,ANNA,Something like that.
4,10,DEAN,"All right. I like this plan. So, where's this grace of yours?"
4,10,ANNA,"Lost track. I was falling about 10,000 miles per hour at the time."
4,10,SAM,"Wait. You mean falling, like, literally?"
4,10,ANNA,Yes.
4,10,SAM,"Like the way a human eye can see? Like a comet, maybe, or a meteor?"
4,10,ANNA,Why do you ask?
4,10,SAM,"Here. In march '85, a meteorite vanished in the night sky over northwestern Ohio. It was sighted nine months before Anna was born, and she was born in that part of Ohio."
4,10,RUBY,You're pretty buff for a nerd.
4,10,SAM,"Look, I think it was Anna and here, same time -- another meteor over Kentucky."
4,10,RUBY,And that's her grace?
4,10,SAM,Might be.
4,10,RUBY,All right. That just narrows it down to an entire state.
4,10,SAM,"Look, it's a start."
4,10,RUBY,Sam... I'm sorry.
4,10,SAM,For what?
4,10,RUBY,"For bringing you this mess. If I had known, I would have kept my trap shut."
4,10,SAM,"Yeah, well, we'll muddle through."
4,10,RUBY,"Not this time. You do not want to get between these two armies. It's Godzilla and Mothra. If one side doesn't get us, the other one will."
4,10,SAM,"So, what do you want to do? Dump Anna and run? Forget it. Look, I know the angels freak you out."
4,10,RUBY,Forget the angels. It's Alastair I'm scared of.
4,10,RUBY,You met him in the church. Practically the grand inquisitor downstairs. Picasso with a razor.
4,10,SAM,And?
4,10,RUBY,And you should pull him out and throw him back in the pit... if you weren't so out of shape.
4,10,SAM,Ruby...
4,10,RUBY,"No, your abilities -- you're getting flabby."
4,10,SAM,"Yeah, so how do I tone up?"
4,10,RUBY,You know how. You know what you got to do.
4,10,SAM,"No, I'm not doing that anymore."
4,10,SAM,I said no.
4,10,RUBY,"Well, then you better pray that Anna gets her groove back, or we're all dead."
4,10,ANNA,Pamela get home okay?
4,10,DEAN,"Yeah. She said she was sorry. It's just after last time, she, uh... This is just a little too rich for her blood."
4,10,ANNA,I don't blame her. You guys should do the same.
4,10,DEAN,"Well, we're not that smart. Can I ask you something? What do they want me for? Why did they save me?"
4,10,ANNA,I'm sorry. The angels aren't talking about it. And it was after I fell.
4,10,DEAN,That's another question. Why would you fall? Why would you want to be one of us?
4,10,ANNA,You don't mean that.
4,10,DEAN,"I don't? A bunch of -- of miserable bastards... Eating, crapping, confused, afraid."
4,10,ANNA,I don't know. There's loyalty... forgiveness... love.
4,10,ANNA,Chocolate cake.
4,10,ANNA,Sex.
4,10,DEAN,"Yeah, you got me there."
4,10,ANNA,"I mean it. Every emotion, Dean, even the bad ones... It's why I fell. It's why... why I'd give anything not to have to go back. Anything."
4,10,DEAN,"Feelings are overrated, if you ask me."
4,10,ANNA,Beats being an angel.
4,10,DEAN,How's that possible? You guys are powerful and perfect. You don't doubt yourselves or God or anything.
4,10,ANNA,"Perfect... Like a marble statue. Cold... no choice... only obedience. Dean, do you know how many angels have actually seen God? Seen his face?"
4,10,DEAN,All of you?
4,10,ANNA,Four angels. Four. And I'm not one of them.
4,10,DEAN,"That's it? Well, then how do you even know that there is a God?"
4,10,ANNA,We have to take it on faith... Which we're killed if we don't have.
4,10,DEAN,Huh.
4,10,ANNA,"I was stationed on earth 2,000 years. Just... watching... silent... invisible... out on the road... sick for home... waiting on orders from an unknowable father I can't begin to understand. So don't tell me that --"
4,10,ANNA,What is so funny? What?
4,10,DEAN,Nothing. Sorry. It's just...I can relate.
4,10,SAM,Hey.
4,10,DEAN,Did you find something?
4,10,SAM,I think so.
4,10,SAM,"Union, Kentucky. Found some accounts of a local miracle."
4,10,SAM,"Yeah. In '85, there was an empty field outside of town. Six months later, there was a full-grown oak. They say it looks a century old at least."
4,10,DEAN,"Anna, what do you think?"
4,10,ANNA,"The grace. Where it hit, it could have done something like that, easy."
4,10,DEAN,So grace ground zero -- it's not destruction. It's...
4,10,ANNA,Pure creation.
4,10,RUBY,What?
4,10,DEAN,Nothing. It's just an angel and a demon riding in the backseat. It's like the setup to a bad joke... or a Penthouse Forum letter.
4,10,SAM,Dude... Reality... Porn.
4,10,DEAN,You call this reality?
4,10,DEAN,It's beautiful.
4,10,ANNA,It's where the grace touched down. I can feel it.
4,10,DEAN,You ready to do this?
4,10,ANNA,Not really.
4,10,SAM,"Anna, what are we even looking for?"
4,10,ANNA,It doesn't matter. It's not here. Not anymore. Someone took it.
4,10,DEAN,We still got the hex bags. I say we head back to the panic room.
4,10,RUBY,"What, forever?"
4,10,DEAN,I'm just thinking out loud!
4,10,RUBY,"Oh, you call that thinking?"
4,10,SAM,"Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Stop it."
4,10,RUBY,"Anna's grace is gone. You understand? She can't angel up. She can't protect us. We can't fight Heaven and Hell. One side maybe, but not both. Not at once."
4,10,ANNA,Um... guys? The angels are talking again.
4,10,SAM,What are they saying?
4,10,ANNA,"It's weird... Like a recording... a loop. It says, ""Dean Winchester gives us Anna by midnight, or..."""
4,10,DEAN,Or what?
4,10,ANNA,"""...or we hurl him back to damnation."""
4,10,SAM,Anna.. Do you know of any weapon that works on an angel? To what? To kill them?
4,10,ANNA,Nothing we could get to... Not right now.
4,10,DEAN,"Okay, wait, wait. I say we call Bobby. We get him back from hedonism."
4,10,SAM,"Dean, what's he gonna tell us that we don't already know?"
4,10,DEAN,"I don't know, but we got to think of something!"
4,10,DEAN,Hey. Holding up okay?
4,10,ANNA,Trying.
4,10,DEAN,Yeah.
4,10,ANNA,"A little scared, I guess. So, um... Dean... I just wanted to thank you."
4,10,DEAN,For what?
4,10,ANNA,Everything. You guys -- you didn't have to help me --
4,10,DEAN,"Hey, let's can the ""thanks for trying"" speech, you know? Participation trophies suck ass."
4,10,ANA,I don't know. Maybe I don't deserve to be saved.
4,10,DEAN,Don't talk like that.
4,10,ANNA,"I disobeyed. Lucifer disobeyed. It's our murder one, and I knew it. Maybe I got to pay."
4,10,DEAN,"Yeah, well, we've all done things we got to pay for."
4,10,ANNA,I got to tell you something. You're not gonna like it.
4,10,DEAN,Okay. what?
4,10,ANNA,"About a week ago, I heard the angels talking... About you... What you did in Hell. Dean, I know. It wasn't your fault. You should forgive yourself."
4,10,DEAN,"Anna, I don't w-want to, uh... I don't want to... I can't talk about that."
4,10,ANNA,"I know. But when you can, you have people that want to help. You are not alone. That's all I'm trying to say."
4,10,DEAN,What was that for?
4,10,ANNA,You know... Our last night on earth... All that.
4,10,DEAN,You're stealing my best line.
4,10,ALASTAIR,"Hello, Ruby."
4,10,RUBY,Alastair.
4,10,ALASTAIR,"I have to say, I'm surprised to find you out in the open like this."
4,10,RUBY,Yeah? Desperate times.
4,10,ALASTAIR,That they are. You looking for this? [ takes out Ruby's knife ] Your gawky human friend gave it to me.
4,10,RUBY,Keep it. I just came to talk.
4,10,ALASTAIR,About what? About how a demon is protecting an angel? We really must revoke your membership.
4,10,RUBY,"Look, I know I'm not employee of the month, but this -- I never wanted to get in the middle of this."
4,10,ALASTAIR,"Why are you here, Ruby?"
4,10,RUBY,I'll give you the angel.
4,10,ALASTAIR,Will you? And in return?
4,10,RUBY,"I walk away. Me and the Winchester boys, both of them. This angel business is none of our business."
4,10,ALASTAIR,"Hmm. You know...I'd always heard that you were a devious, cowardly little slut. You don't disappoint."
4,10,RUBY,"So, what do you say?"
4,10,ALASTAIR,It's interesting... Prudent.
4,10,ALASTAIR,"But, uh... Let me make you a... counteroffer."
4,10,URIEL,Look at that. It's so cute when monkeys wear clothes.
4,10,DEAN,"I'm dreaming, aren't I?"
4,10,URIEL,It's the only way we could chat... since you're hiding like cowards.
4,10,DEAN,Don't normally see you off leash. Where's your boss?
4,10,URIEL,"Castiel? Oh, he, uh... He's not here. See, he has this weakness. He likes you. Time's up, boy. We want the girl."
4,10,DEAN,"Wouldn't try that if I were you. See, she got her grace back. Full-blown angel now."
4,10,URIEL,"That would be a neat trick, considering... [ takes out a necklace ] ...I have her grace right here. We can't let Hell get their hooks into her."
4,10,DEAN,"Well, then why don't you just give her back her angel juice?"
4,10,URIEL,She committed a serious crime.
4,10,DEAN,What? Thinking for herself?
4,10,URIEL,"This is our business, not yours. She's not even human... Not technically."
4,10,DEAN,"Yeah, well, I guess I just like being a pain in the pooper."
4,10,URIEL,No. There's more. You cut yourself a slice of... angel food cake. Didn't you? Huh? You did.
4,10,DEAN,"What do you care? You're junkless down there, right? Like a Ken doll?"
4,10,DEAN,"Or what? What, you're gonna toss me back in the hole? You're bluffing."
4,10,URIEL,"Try me. This is a whole lot bigger than the plans we got for you, Dean. You can be replaced."
4,10,DEAN,What the hell? Go ahead and do it.
4,10,URIEL,"You're just crazy enough to go, aren't you?"
4,10,DEAN,What can I say? I don't break easy.
4,10,URIEL,"Oh, yes... you do. You just got to know where to apply the right pressure."
4,10,ALASTAIR,"You know the problem with your generation? Instant gratification. It's all now, now, now. No patience, no craftsmanship. But I do have to say... This knife of yours... It's an exquisite piece. You must tell me where you found it. You know... I haven't been up here since Poland '43. Truth is, I loathe it. It's chilly. No stink of blood or sizzle of flesh or the wet flap of flayed skin. I don't know how you stand it. So, the sooner you cooperate, the sooner I can finish up with this ghastly angel business and return home to my studies. But no rush. Let's take our time... Relish the moment. Now, I'm going to remove this, but don't you go smoking out of that meat. You won't get very far."
4,10,RUBY,Oh!
4,10,ALASTAIR,Now you tell me where that angel is.
4,10,ALASTAIR,No?
4,10,RUBY,"No. I tell you, you kill me. But I'll show you."
4,10,SAM,"I don't know, man. Where's Ruby?"
4,10,DEAN,"Hey, she's your Hell buddy."
4,10,ANNA,"Little early for that, isn't it?"
4,10,DEAN,It's 2 a.m. somewhere.
4,10,ANNA,You okay?
4,10,DEAN,"Yeah, of course."
4,10,CASTIEL,"Hello, Anna. It's good to see you."
4,10,SAM,How? How did you find us? [ pause ] Dean?
4,10,DEAN,[to ANNA] I'm sorry.
4,10,SAM,Why?
4,10,ANNA,Because they gave him a choice. They either kill me... or kill you. I know how their minds work.
4,10,ANNA,You did the best you could. I forgive you. Okay. No more tricks. No more running. I'm ready.
4,10,CASTIEL,I'm sorry.
4,10,ANNA,No. You're not. Not really. You don't know the feeling.
4,10,ANNA,Orders are orders. I know. Just make it quick.
4,10,ALASTAIR,Don't you touch a hair on that poor girl's head.
4,10,URIEL,How dare you come in this room... you pussing sore?
4,10,ALASTAIR,"Name-calling. That hurt my feelings... You sanctimonious, fanatical prick."
4,10,CASTIEL,Turn around and walk away now.
4,10,ALASTAIR,Sure. Just give us the girl. We'll make sure she gets punished good and proper.
4,10,CASTIEL,You know who we are and what we will do. I won't say it again. Leave now... or we lay you to waste.
4,10,ALASTAIR,Think I'll take my chances.
4,10,ALASTAIR,"Sorry, kiddo. Why don't you go run to daddy?"
4,10,DEMON,Aaaaahhhh!
4,10,ALASTAIR,"Potestas inferna, me confirma. Potestas inferna, me confirma. Potestas inferma, me confirma!"
4,10,ALASTAIR,"Dean, Dean, Dean... I am so disappointed. You had such promise."
4,10,URIEL,No!
4,10,ANNA,Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes! Shut your eyes!
4,10,DEAN,"Well, what are you guys waiting for? Go get Anna. Unless, of course, you're scared."
4,10,URIEL,This isn't over.
4,10,DEAN,"Oh, it looks over to me, junkless."
4,10,SAM,You okay?
4,10,RUBY,Not so much.
4,10,DEAN,What took you so long to get here?
4,10,RUBY,Sorry I'm late with the demon delivery. I was only being tortured.
4,10,DEAN,"I got to hand it to you, Sammy. Bringing them all together all at once -- angels and demons. It was a damn good plan."
4,10,SAM,"Yeah, well, when you got Godzilla and Mothra on your ass, best to get out of their way and let them fight."
4,10,DEAN,"Yeah, now you're just bragging."
4,10,SAM,"So, I guess she's some big-time angel now, huh? She must be happy... Wherever she is."
4,10,DEAN,I doubt it.
4,10,DEAN,I can't believe we made it out of there.
4,10,SAM,Again.
4,10,DEAN,I know you heard him.
4,10,SAM,Who?
4,10,DEAN,Alastair. What he said... about how I had promise.
4,10,SAM,I heard him.
4,10,DEAN,You're not curious?
4,10,SAM,"Dean, I'm damn curious. But you're not talking about Hell, and I'm not pushing."
4,10,DEAN,"It wasn't four months, you know."
4,10,SAM,What?
4,10,DEAN,"It was four months up here, but down there... I don't know. Time's different. It was more like 40 years."
4,10,SAM,My God.
4,10,DEAN,"They, uh... They sliced and carved and tore at me in ways that you... Until there was nothing left. And then, suddenly... I would be whole again... like magic... just so they could start in all over. And Alastair... at the end of every day... every one... he would come over. And he would make me an offer. To take me off the rack... if I put souls on... if I started the torturing. And every day, I told him to stick it where the sun shines. For 30 years, I told him. But then I couldn't do it anymore, Sammy. I couldn't. And I got off that rack. God help me, I got right off it, and I started ripping them apart. I lost count of how many souls. [ a tear rolls down his cheek ] The -- the things that I did to them."
4,10,SAM,"Dean... Dean, look, you held out for 30 years. That's longer than anyone would have."
4,10,DEAN,"[ crying ] How I feel... This... inside me... I wish I couldn't feel anything, Sammy. I wish I couldn't feel a damn thing."
4,11,TV,"Following the Civil War, the eyes of the nation turned to the West, where outposts like Fort Bellows served as—"
4,11,BILL,"Aw, come on. Crap."
4,11,BILL,What the hell?! Man.
4,11,BILL,You? I-It's impossible. Just stay away from me! Just stay away from me!
4,11,SAM,What are you doing?
4,11,DEAN,What's it look like I'm doing?
4,11,SAM,Like you're looking for a job.
4,11,DEAN,Yahtzee.
4,11,SAM,We just finished a job like two hours ago.
4,11,DEAN,"Adrenaline's still pumping, I guess. So, what do you think... Cedar Rapids, Tulsa, or Chi-Town?"
4,11,SAM,I am all for working. I really am. But you got us chasing cases nonstop for like a month now. We need sleep.
4,11,DEAN,"Yeah, we can sleep when we're dead."
4,11,SAM,"You're exhausted, Dean."
4,11,DEAN,I'm good.
4,11,SAM,"No, you're not. You're running on fumes, and you can't run forever."
4,11,DEAN,And what am I running from?
4,11,SAM,From what you told me. Or are we pretending that never happened?
4,11,DEAN,"Stratton, Nebraska. Farm town. A man gets hacked to death in a locked room inside a locked house. No signs of forced entry."
4,11,SAM,Sounds like a ghost.
4,11,DEAN,"Yes, it does."
4,11,DEAN,"Boy, three bedrooms, two baths, and one homicide. This place is gonna sell like hotcakes."
4,11,DEAN,"Hey, check this out."
4,11,DEAN,Huh.
4,11,SAM,It's probably a dumbwaiter. All these old houses had them.
4,11,DEAN,Know-it-all.
4,11,SAM,What?
4,11,DEAN,What?
4,11,SAM,You said...
4,11,DEAN,What?
4,11,SAM,Never mind.
4,11,DEAN,"Well, no bloodstains, fresh coat of paint, it's a bunch of bubkes."
4,11,SAM,Needle's all over the place.
4,11,DEAN,Yeah—power lines.
4,11,SAM,Great.
4,11,SAM,Uh...
4,11,DEAN,"Well, that's super-disturbing."
4,11,SAM,Think it got left behind?
4,11,DEAN,By who? Unless Bill Gibson likes to play with doll heads.
4,11,SAM,Uh-oh.
4,11,DEAN,I thought you said this place was still for sale.
4,11,SAM,"Apparently, it's not."
4,11,DANNY,"Come on, Buster! Good dog!"
4,11,SUSAN,"What do you think? It's nice, right?"
4,11,KATE,Did anyone bother to check if we get a signal out here?
4,11,BRIAN,"Actually, I did, Kate. But we decided to move anyway, just to ruin your life. Come on. Let's unpack."
4,11,KATE,"Uncle Ted, please back me up here."
4,11,TED,"Kid's right, Bri. You're ruining her life."
4,11,KATE,See?
4,11,BRIAN,"Thanks for the help, Uncle Ted."
4,11,TED,"Calling it like I see it, buddy."
4,11,SUSAN,Hey.
4,11,BRIAN,What?
4,11,SUSAN,Be nice.
4,11,BRIAN,I am nice. What do you think? We do okay?
4,11,SUSAN,I don't know.
4,11,KATE,Who are they?
4,11,BRIAN,Can I help you?
4,11,SAM,Hi. Are you the new owner?
4,11,BRIAN,Yeah. You guys are...?
4,11,DEAN,This is Mr. Stanwyk. I'm Mr. Babar. County code enforcement.
4,11,BRIAN,We had the building inspected last week. Is there a problem?
4,11,SAM,"Asbestos in the walls, a gas leak—yeah, I'd say we got a problem."
4,11,SUSAN,Asbestos? Meaning what?
4,11,SAM,"Meaning until this house is up to code, it's uninhabitable."
4,11,BRIAN,Whoa whoa whoa. You're saying we can't stay here?
4,11,DEAN,It's a health hazard. You don't want to.
4,11,TED,Hold up. We just drove four hundred miles.
4,11,DEAN,"There's a motel just down the road. Till this gets cleaned up, I suggest you stay there."
4,11,BRIAN,"All right, and what if we don't?"
4,11,DEAN,"Well, you get a fine or you go to jail. Pick your poison."
4,11,BRIAN,"One night. One night, and I'll take care of everything, ASAP, I promise."
4,11,DEAN,"Yeah, you do that."
4,11,KATE,"Another motel? Awesome, Dad. I hope this one has hooker sheets, like the last one."
4,11,SUSAN,Danny!
4,11,BRIAN,"Come on, Danny!"
4,11,SAM,"What did the room look like when you found it, Mrs. Curry?"
4,11,MRS CURRY,"I already told the local boys, there was blood everywhere."
4,11,DEAN,And Mr. Gibson—where was he?
4,11,MRS CURRY,Everywhere.
4,11,SAM,How long have you been cleaning Mr. Gibson's house?
4,11,MRS CURRY,About five years.
4,11,DEAN,So you knew him pretty well.
4,11,MRS CURRY,"Well, not really well. He was real private. Not the easiest man. Not that I blame him."
4,11,SAM,What do you mean?
4,11,MRS CURRY,"His wife dies in childbirth. Daughter hangs herself in the attic twenty years later. I'd be bitter, too. I think I got some pictures."
4,11,MRS CURRY,Here.
4,11,DEAN,Thanks. Can we keep these?
4,11,MRS CURRY,Suit yourself.
4,11,SAM,"Now, why'd the daughter kill herself?"
4,11,MRS CURRY,I don't know. That was before my time.
4,11,DEAN,Did you ever notice anything odd in the house when you were cleaning it?
4,11,MRS CURRY,Like what?
4,11,DEAN,"Like, you know, like lights going on and off, things not being where you left them."
4,11,MRS CURRY,"No. Well, maybe there was one thing."
4,11,SAM,What's that?
4,11,MRS CURRY,"Well, sometimes, I thought I heard like a...rustling in the walls."
4,11,DEAN,Like a rat?
4,11,MRS CURRY,Yeah.
4,11,DEAN,"Must have been some big sons of guns out there, huh?"
4,11,MRS CURRY,Wouldn't know. Never saw any.
4,11,SAM,Do you happen to know where Mrs. Gibson and her daughter were buried?
4,11,MRS CURRY,They were both cremated.
4,11,SAM,All right. So it probably wasn't the mom or the daughter. Whose ghost was it?
4,11,DEAN,I don't know. But I say we give that place a real once-over and see.
4,11,TED,"Code enforcement, my ass. There's no asbestos."
4,11,BRIAN,You sure?
4,11,TED,"Hell yes. I've built enough homes to know that. No gas leak, either."
4,11,BRIAN,Who were those guys?
4,11,TED,Not from the county—I can tell you that.
4,11,SUSAN,Hey!
4,11,SUSAN,You okay?
4,11,KATE,"Yeah. I just thought I saw something, that's all."
4,11,SUSAN,"It—it's gonna be great here, Kate. It really is."
4,11,KATE,"Yeah, Mom. I'm sure. Everything's gonna change."
4,11,SUSAN,Danny! Are you unpacking?
4,11,DANNY,"Uh, yeah. I'm almost finished."
4,11,DANNY,Hello? It's okay. I'm Danny. Hi!
4,11,SUSAN,"""Zucchini will grow, but the soil is too acidic for beets."" Do you understand any of this?"
4,11,BRIAN,Can you smell that?
4,11,BRIAN,That. It smells like a raccoon died up there or something.
4,11,SUSAN,That's pleasant. Thank you. Can I continue having a conversation with myself?
4,11,BRIAN,"Well, I'm listening. A...vegetable... garden."
4,11,SUSAN,"What are we doing, Bri?"
4,11,BRIAN,What do you mean?
4,11,SUSAN,Us. On a farm. Talking about zucchini.
4,11,BRIAN,It's gonna be different. I promise you. We're gonna be happy.
4,11,SUSAN,And if we're not?
4,11,BRIAN,We will be. We have to be.
4,11,SUSAN,I can't put the kids through another year like the last.
4,11,DEAN,"Crap. So, what now?"
4,11,SAM,We could tell them the truth.
4,11,DEAN,Really?
4,11,SAM,"No, not really."
4,11,TED,"Hey, guys! You're gonna want to come see this!"
4,11,SUSAN,What the...
4,11,BRIAN,Crayon. Danny!
4,11,DANNY,Yeah?
4,11,BRIAN,Get your butt down here!
4,11,TED,Tell you what—if my kid did this—
4,11,SUSAN,"He's not your kid, Ted. Just butt out."
4,11,SUSAN,Hey. Go easy on him. The teacher said he might act out.
4,11,BRIAN,"Hey, buddy. Something you want to tell me and your mom?"
4,11,DANNY,I didn't do that.
4,11,BRIAN,"Okay. Look, just tell me the truth, and all you got to do is clean it up, okay? No punishment."
4,11,DANNY,But I didn't. The girl in the walls did it.
4,11,SUSAN,The girl in the walls?
4,11,DANNY,She wants you to go and me to stay.
4,11,BRIAN,"All right, one last time—the truth, buddy."
4,11,DANNY,"That is the truth. I can stay, but she hate grownups. And if you don't leave, she's gonna get really, really mad!"
4,11,BRIAN,"All right, go to your room."
4,11,DANNY,"Mom! If Andy were here, he'd believe me!"
4,11,BRIAN,Upstairs! Now!
4,11,KATE,"It's okay, Buster. It's okay. I hate it here, too."
4,11,KATE,"Ugh. Ew, Buster! Gross! What's the matter with you?"
4,11,KATE,"Oh, my god. Oh, god."
4,11,KATE,Ew! Ew!
4,11,SUSAN,It's okay.
4,11,DANNY,What's going on?
4,11,BRIAN,"Katie, baby, baby. Calm down and tell us what happened."
4,11,KATE,I just got molested by Casper the pervy ghost! That's what happened!
4,11,BRIAN,Ghost?
4,11,KATE,"Yes, dad! A ghost!"
4,11,DANNY,It's the girl in the walls!
4,11,KATE,Who?!
4,11,BRIAN,"Both of you, knock it off."
4,11,DEAN,We heard screams. What's going on?
4,11,BRIAN,"Oh, you two! Did you touch my daughter?!"
4,11,DEAN,What? No.
4,11,BRIAN,Who are you guys?
4,11,SAM,"Relax, please. You have a ghost."
4,11,BRIAN,A ghost.
4,11,KATE,I told you!
4,11,DANNY,It's the girl!
4,11,BRIAN,"Both of you, relax. What are you guys playing?"
4,11,DEAN,Your family's in danger. You need to get out of the house now.
4,11,TED,What the hell?
4,11,DEAN,Nobody move!
4,11,DANNY,Buster!
4,11,BRIAN,Buster! Buster? Buster! Buster!
4,11,TED,What the hell?
4,11,DANNY,Buster!
4,11,BRIAN,Go back inside. Go!
4,11,DEAN,"We are not the bad guys, but you're in danger."
4,11,SAM,First thing's first. You got to get your family out of here.
4,11,DEAN,Head to the motel I was talking about. You'll be safe there.
4,11,BRIAN,What are you two gonna do?
4,11,DEAN,"Oh, no! Oh, come on! Oh, come on!"
4,11,SAM,"Dude, the guns are gone. So is the... Basically, everything is gone."
4,11,TED,Truck's no good.
4,11,BRIAN,Both tires slashed.
4,11,DEAN,What kind of ghost messes with a man's wheels?!
4,11,KATE,What's going on? What's going on?
4,11,KATE,She's there! She's there!
4,11,SUSAN,Where?!
4,11,KATE,She was right there in the woods!
4,11,DEAN,What's a ghost doing outside?
4,11,SAM,You want to stay and find out?
4,11,DEAN,Everybody inside.
4,11,TED,Are you crazy? We need to get the hell out of here!
4,11,DEAN,In what?! This ghost is hunting us! Everybody back inside now! Move!
4,11,DEAN,"Whatever's outside, it can't get in this circle. As long as the salt line is unbroken, this is the safest place to be."
4,11,BRIAN,Safe from ghosts?
4,11,DEAN,"Yes, as a matter of fact."
4,11,BRIAN,Okay. I'm not listening to this anymore. Come on. I got to get my family out of here. Let's go.
4,11,DEAN,Nobody's going anywhere until we kill this thing.
4,11,SAM,"Sir, please. This is what we do. Just...trust us."
4,11,DANNY,You hunt ghosts?
4,11,DEAN,That's right.
4,11,DANNY,Like Scooby-Doo?
4,11,DEAN,Better.
4,11,SAM,"You saw her outside, right? Okay. Does she look like either one of the girls?"
4,11,KATE,"Her. She was paler and a lot dirtier, but that was her."
4,11,DANNY,That's the girl in the walls.
4,11,SAM,So it's the daughter?
4,11,SUSAN,That girl in the picture—She-She's dead?
4,11,SAM,She killed herself inside this house.
4,11,DEAN,"So, what. The maid got her story wrong? Rebecca wasn't cremated?"
4,11,SAM,Unless her spirit's just attached to something inside the house.
4,11,DEAN,"She hung herself in the attic, right?"
4,11,SAM,You want to babysit? I'll check it out.
4,11,TED,"Look—I don't care who hung themselves where. Maybe something is going on here, but—"
4,11,DEAN,"It's a spirit, man."
4,11,DEAN,"Well, nobody's leaving the house."
4,11,TED,Stop me.
4,11,DEAN,"Listen, man. I've got a gun. You don't get your ass back in that circle, you're gonna have yourself a third hole."
4,11,SAM,"Dude, you don't have a gun."
4,11,DEAN,And? I'm not letting that bastard or anyone else die tonight.
4,11,SAM,You cool?
4,11,DEAN,Go.
4,11,TED,"Hey. Fonzie. Question for you. This indestructible force field made out of salt... Have to be kosher stuff, or what?"
4,11,SUSAN,"Knock it off, Ted."
4,11,SUSAN,Sh..
4,11,KATE,What was that?
4,11,KATE,Mom.
4,11,DEAN,"All right, everybody stay calm. She's a ghost. She can't come in the circle."
4,11,KATE,I thought you said ghosts couldn't cross the circle.
4,11,DEAN,They can't. She's not a ghost.
4,11,TED,Shoot her! Shoot her!
4,11,DEAN,"Yeah, about that... Go, go, go! Move!"
4,11,SAM,Hey!
4,11,BRIAN,Hey. You okay?
4,11,DEAN,Where is everybody?
4,11,BRIAN,Hiding.
4,11,DEAN,"All right, go get them. Go. Go get them."
4,11,DEAN,"So, it's not a ghost."
4,11,SAM,"So, it's just a girl?"
4,11,DEAN,"It's not just a girl. It's psycho Nell. I'm telling you, man—humans."
4,11,SAM,"So who is she, then?"
4,11,DEAN,"I don't know. Maybe it's the daughter, Rebecca. Maybe she didn't hang herself."
4,11,SAM,"Dude, no. She'd have to be like fifty years old by now."
4,11,DEAN,"Well, I don't know. What'd you find in the attic?"
4,11,SAM,Some old junk. I found Rebecca's diary. That's about it.
4,11,DEAN,"I wish you'd found a howitzer. Listen, we got to get this family safe. I mean, it's just a human, so they can make a run for it. We just got to hold her off."
4,11,SUSAN,We're okay.
4,11,BRIAN,Danny! Ted! We got to go!
4,11,TED,I'm good!
4,11,SUSAN,Danny! Come on!
4,11,BRIAN,"Danny, buddy, we got to go!"
4,11,TED,Told you it was some crazy bitch.
4,11,DEAN,"Yes, you did."
4,11,SAM,"Head to town. We'll take it from here, okay?"
4,11,SUSAN,"Danny, come on, baby! We're leaving!"
4,11,BRIAN,"Danny, we got to go!"
4,11,SUSAN,"Brian, where—Where is he?"
4,11,BRIAN,Danny!
4,11,SUSAN,Danny!
4,11,BRIAN,"Suse, Suse, Suse. We will find Danny, I promise you."
4,11,SUSAN,No.
4,11,BRIAN,"No. Take Kate and go now. Now, while you still have a chance."
4,11,SUSAN,Not without Danny.
4,11,BRIAN,We will find him.
4,11,KATE,I am not going out there with Mom alone.
4,11,DEAN,"She's right. Until we find your son, the safest place for you right now is in the shed."
4,11,KATE,I am not going in there either.
4,11,DEAN,"Yes, you are. It is the best defense. The windows are boarded up. It's got one door. It's our best shot right now. Trust me."
4,11,BRIAN,Suse. Kate. Go. Go.
4,11,SAM,"All right, you and me will take the outside. You two take the house. Let's go."
4,11,TED,What are you doing?
4,11,DEAN,She's human. She had to come from somewhere.
4,11,TED,You smell that?
4,11,DEAN,Every day.
4,11,DEAN,Come on.
4,11,TED,You're not going down there.
4,11,DEAN,"Well, do you want to?"
4,11,DEAN,Please nobody grab my leg. Please nobody grab my leg.
4,11,DEAN,Dog. It's what's for dinner. Danny?
4,11,TED,Find anything?
4,11,DEAN,"Yeah, her kitchen."
4,11,TED,Her what?
4,11,BRIAN,"Look, why are we just standing here? Let's go in. Let's check the house."
4,11,SAM,"We have to wait for those guys to get back, okay?"
4,11,DEAN,"Sam, it's me."
4,11,SAM,Help me out.
4,11,SUSAN,Did you get Danny?
4,11,DEAN,No.
4,11,SUSAN,"No? Well, where's Ted?"
4,11,DEAN,He's outside.
4,11,SUSAN,"Well, why doesn't he come inside?"
4,11,DEAN,Because I had to carry him out. I'm sorry.
4,11,SUSAN,"You're...what does that mean? What does that mean, you're sorry?"
4,11,BRIAN,Are you saying that he's dead?
4,11,SUSAN,"No. No, he's not saying that he's dead. You're not saying that, are you?"
4,11,DEAN,We were in the walls and she attacked.
4,11,SUSAN,Oh my god.
4,11,DEAN,And I couldn't get to him in time.
4,11,KATE,Uncle Ted is dead?
4,11,DEAN,I shouldn't have left him alone. I'm very sorry.
4,11,BRIAN,"We'll find him, Suse. We will."
4,11,SUSAN,"Where else is there to look? Danny's dead, isn't he?"
4,11,BRIAN,"No, Suse."
4,11,SUSAN,He is. Why not? She killed my brother. Now she killed my son.
4,11,BRIAN,"No, Danny is alive."
4,11,SUSAN,"No, no, he isn't."
4,11,BRIAN,"Yes, he is. Do you remember what he said about the girl who lived in the walls? She said he could stay."
4,11,SUSAN,"No. No. I just don't understand why this happens to us. I mean, we're good people. We're a good family."
4,11,BRIAN,"What happened to Andy happened, okay? I cannot change that. But I will find Danny, I promise you. And when I do, we are gonna be fine. You and me, the kids, we're gonna be fine."
4,11,SUSAN,Okay.
4,11,DEAN,Andy your son?
4,11,BRIAN,Oldest. He got himself killed in a car accident last year.
4,11,DEAN,I'm sorry.
4,11,BRIAN,"It nearly tore Suse and I apart. Still could, I imagine. That's why we moved here. Fresh air, fresh start. Not even my line. Marriage counselor. 'Course, she might be right. After all, what could possibly go wrong in the country?"
4,11,DEAN,I'm getting your son back. If it's the last godforsaken thing I do.
4,11,BRIAN,Why do you care so much?
4,11,SAM,Dean.
4,11,SAM,We gotta talk.
4,11,DEAN,What is that?
4,11,SAM,Rebecca's diary. I just finished reading it.
4,11,DEAN,And?
4,11,SAM,That girl back there? Pretty sure she was Rebecca's daughter.
4,11,DEAN,Rebecca had a kid?
4,11,SAM,"It's all she talks about. Being pregnant, being ashamed of being pregnant."
4,11,SAM,Maybe because her dad called her a dirty little whore and said he was gonna lock the baby up.
4,11,DEAN,Why would he say that?
4,11,DEAN,"Oh, gross."
4,11,SAM,Yeah.
4,11,DEAN,So the daddy was the babydaddy too?
4,11,SAM,"Dude was a monster, Dean."
4,11,DEAN,"Wow, a story ripped from an Austrian headline. Humans, man. So she's been locked up her whole life?"
4,11,SAM,You saw her eyes. Has she ever seen light? She's barely human.
4,11,DEAN,"Okay, so, what, then, she's been caged up like an animal and she busts out and ganks dear old Dad? Slash Granddad?"
4,11,SAM,I guess.
4,11,DEAN,"Well, can't say I blame her."
4,11,SAM,"I'm sure her life was hell, Dean. It doesn't mean she gets a free pass for murder."
4,11,DEAN,Like you know what hell's like.
4,11,SAM,I didn't...
4,11,DEAN,Forget it.
4,11,SAM,So where do we find her?
4,11,DEAN,"Kid's gotta eat, right?"
4,11,SAM,What?
4,11,DEAN,"He kept her hidden, locked up, but he had to feed her, didn't he?"
4,11,SAM,I guess.
4,11,DEAN,I think I know where.
4,11,SAM,"Could've kept her hidden here for years. Kept her fed, nobody would ever know."
4,11,BRIAN,Danny! Danny!
4,11,DEAN,"Watch out, I'm going down."
4,11,BRIAN,No. That's my son.
4,11,DEAN,"I know it is, but I said that I would get him. I will. Let me."
4,11,SAM,"Hey, you got curtains? We need rope."
4,11,SUSAN,It's okay. Shh. It's okay.
4,11,DEAN,Bitch is a klepto.
4,11,DEAN,Come on. Danny. Danny.
4,11,DEAN,Danny?
4,11,DEAN,"Your dad's upstairs. Come on. Watch your head, watch your head."
4,11,DANNY,"Hurry, he's coming back."
4,11,DEAN,He?
4,11,DANNY,Her brother.
4,11,KATE,Oh my god!
4,11,SAM,Danny!
4,11,DANNY,Okay!
4,11,SAM,Pull.
4,11,BRIAN,"Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy. Don't look back, Danny. Just come on, come."
4,11,KATE,Mom.
4,11,KATE,Mom!
4,11,BRIAN,Come on. You okay? It's okay.
4,11,SAM,Get him out of here. You gotta go.
4,11,SAM,Dean?
4,11,KATE,"Mom! Come on, Mom!"
4,11,BRIAN,Suse!
4,11,DEAN,Thanks for the head start.
4,11,BRIAN,Why doesn't it surprise me you guys don't like the police?
4,11,SAM,"It's sort of a mutual-appreciation thing, really."
4,11,BRIAN,"Well, thank you."
4,11,SUSAN,Thank you.
4,11,DEAN,You okay?
4,11,SUSAN,"No, we're the opposite of okay, but we're together."
4,11,SUSAN,Thanks.
4,11,SAM,You okay?
4,11,DEAN,"You know, I felt for those sons of bitches back there. Lifelong torture turns you into something like that."
4,11,SAM,"You were in hell, Dean. Look, maybe you did what you did there, but you're not them. They were barely human."
4,11,DEAN,"Yeah, you're right. I wasn't like them. I was worse. They were animals, Sam, defending territory. Me? I did it for the sheer pleasure."
4,11,SAM,What?
4,11,DEAN,"I enjoyed it, Sam. They took me off the rack, and I tortured souls, and I liked it. All those years, all that pain. Finally getting to deal some out yourself. I didn't care who they put in front of me. Because that pain I felt, it just slipped away. No matter how many people I save, I can't change that. I can't fill this hole. Not ever."
4,12,DEMON,Tell me about those months without your brother.
4,12,DEAN,Why do you trust her so much?
4,12,SAM,She saved my life.
4,12,ALASTAIR,"You don't have the juice to take me on, Sam."
4,12,RUBY,Your abilities—you're getting flabby.
4,12,SAM,"Yeah, so how do I tone up?"
4,12,RUBY,You know what you got to do.
4,12,SAM,"No, I'm not doing that anymore."
4,12,RUBY,Sam...
4,12,SAM,I said no.
4,12,JAY,Charlier cut.
4,12,BARTENDER,Wow. You're really good.
4,12,VANCE,"Yeah, great. Hey, show us another."
4,12,ASSISTANT,"Finish your drink, Vance."
4,12,JAY,This is a simple riffle shuffle.
4,12,BARTENDER,Do a card trick for me.
4,12,JAY,"All right, young lady, would you please tell me when to stop?"
4,12,BARTENDER,Stop.
4,12,JAY,"This is your card. Commit it to memory, hm?"
4,12,VANCE,"That's incredible, Jay."
4,12,ASSISTANT,Don't be a jerk.
4,12,JAY,"Right, now..."
4,12,JAY,Do you see your card?
4,12,BARTENDER,"Um...no, I don't."
4,12,JAY,"No, the cards say no."
4,12,VANCE,Check his pocket.
4,12,VANCE,"Oh, just check—check the damn pocket!"
4,12,JAY,"So, if you then would remove—"
4,12,VANCE,This your card?
4,12,BARTENDER,Why are you so mean? Can't you just leave the old guy alone?
4,12,CHARLIE,Is he wearing eyeliner?
4,12,VERNON,Can't tell. I'm blinded by all the sterling silver.
4,12,JEB,The light has to find me!
4,12,JEB,"Get it? It, it has to find me!"
4,12,HELPER,Let's take it back.
4,12,JAY,Would you guys give it a rest? You're giving me a headache.
4,12,VERNON,"Oh, come on, Jay. His misdirect is shaking his ass like an Eighth Avenue hooker."
4,12,CHARLIE,Used to be about skill.
4,12,JAY,"Yeah, used to be. Used to be. Listen to the two of you. It's pathetic. Bitter old men talking about the glory days. You know what? This douchebag isn't the joke. We are."
4,12,JAY,"Me, for one."
4,12,JAY,"You know, maybe he is a douchebag—"
4,12,JAY,But he's playing the main stage and we can't even afford an assistant. What the hell are we doing?
4,12,CHARLIE,We're doing all right.
4,12,JAY,"No, we're not. We're sad, we're old, and we're dying."
4,12,JAY,I'm gonna do the Table of Death tonight.
4,12,VERNON,"No. No, you're not, Jay. Don't be crazy."
4,12,CHARLIE,"You almost killed yourself the last time you tried it, and that was thirty years ago!"
4,12,JAY,"Oh, who cares if it kills me? At least I'll go out with a headline."
4,12,JAY,"Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to see is not a trick or an illusion—simply a display of daring and dexterity."
4,12,JAY,"Now, young lady, if you'll please check the bindings, you'll see they're very real. Very tight."
4,12,JAY,Thank you. You may take your seat.
4,12,CHARLIE,Damn straight they're tight. You sure you can slip them?
4,12,JEB,"This, this isn't a trick, okay? I, I, I don't do tricks. This is a demonstration—"
4,12,JEB,—about demons and angels—
4,12,JEB,—love and lust—
4,12,DEAN,What a douchebag.
4,12,JEB,—all that stuff mixed up in my head.
4,12,SAM,That's Jeb Dexter.
4,12,DEAN,I don't even want to know how you know that.
4,12,SAM,"He's famous, kind of."
4,12,JEB,"—but whatever happens, no matter how—"
4,12,DEAN,For what? Douchebaggery?
4,12,JEB,"—messed up it gets, don't touch me, okay?"
4,12,JEB,For your own safety.
4,12,JEB,"Go back to hell, demon!"
4,12,DEAN,You've got to be kidding me. A fake demon possession?
4,12,SAM,It's not all crap.
4,12,DEAN,What part of that was not—
4,12,DEAN,—a steaming pile of BS?
4,12,SAM,"Okay, that was crap, but that's not all magicians."
4,12,SAM,It takes skill.
4,12,DEAN,"Oh, right, right, I forgot. You were actually into this stuff, weren't you?"
4,12,DEAN,"Just—it bugs me. You know, playing at demons and, and magic, when the real thing will kill you bloody."
4,12,SAM,Like a guy who drops dead of ten stab wounds—
4,12,SAM,—without a single tear in his shirt?
4,12,DEAN,That's what I'm talking about.
4,12,DEAN,So did your boss have any enemies that you know of?
4,12,ASSISTANT,Vance had plenty of enemies.
4,12,ASSISTANT,He would steal from other magicians. All the time.
4,12,SAM,What would he steal?
4,12,ASSISTANT,"Stage effects, closeup techniques, anything he could get his hands on."
4,12,DEAN,Is that enough to get him killed?
4,12,ASSISTANT,These guys take this stuff pretty seriously.
4,12,ASSISTANT,There you are.
4,12,DEAN,"Did you find anything weird in Vance's stuff? Well, weirder?"
4,12,ASSISTANT,"Matter of fact, I did."
4,12,ASSISTANT,He hated card tricks. Never wanted them around. Let alone in his precious cape.
4,12,CHARLIE,You gonna tell me how you did it?
4,12,JAY,Did what?
4,12,CHARLIE,You know what.
4,12,JAY,The great ones never give away the how.
4,12,CHARLIE,"Yesterday you were sad, old, and dying. Today you're one of the great ones? Come on. This is me you're talking to."
4,12,JAY,You didn't think I could do it.
4,12,CHARLIE,"No, Jay, I didn't. You're my friend, my best friend. I just didn't want to see you get hurt."
4,12,JAY,"Charlie, you want to see something? Look at this."
4,12,CHARLIE,Not bad.
4,12,JAY,"'Not bad'? I've been working to pull an ace out of the middle of the deck for years, just one, and now I can pull three."
4,12,CHARLIE,Still missing the ace of hearts.
4,12,JAY,I want to do the Executioner tonight.
4,12,CHARLIE,Houdini wouldn't try the Executioner.
4,12,JAY,"Exactly. Think about it, Charlie. If I can pull this off..."
4,12,CHARLIE,I think you're pushing your luck.
4,12,JAY,"It wasn't luck. It wasn't. Here, stand over there."
4,12,JAY,Does it?
4,12,CHARLIE,I would do anything for you. You know that. But I will not watch you die. I'll miss that show.
4,12,JAY,"No, you'll be there. You're always there for me. Check your pocket."
4,12,JAY,"I can do it, Charlie. I want to do it."
4,12,JEB,"It's a lame gig. I'm in a fleabag hotel doing this man-of-the-people crap, and freaking Angel's in Vegas doing Cirque du Soleil! That should have been mine."
4,12,DEAN,Looking into the death of Patrick Vance.
4,12,JAY,Jay.
4,12,JAY,My name is Jay.
4,12,VERNON,What a douchebag.
4,12,DEAN,"Couldn't agree more. Is, uh—"
4,12,DEAN,This familiar to you?
4,12,VERNON,Should it be?
4,12,VERNON,My act?
4,12,VERNON,"That was a long time ago. I haven't touched a deck in years, you know..."
4,12,DEAN,Do you know someone that might use them now?
4,12,VERNON,"Well, there was a guy down on Bleeker Street."
4,12,CHARLIE,"Oh, yeah. He, he peddles that kind of specialty stuff."
4,12,DEAN,Did he have a problem with Vance?
4,12,VERNON,"Matter of fact, Vance crossed him about a year ago. Probably cost him fifty grand in royalties."
4,12,DEAN,You know the exact address?
4,12,VERNON,Four twenty-six Bleeker.
4,12,CHARLIE,Ask for Chief.
4,12,DEAN,"I'm, uh, here to see Chief."
4,12,YOUNG MAN,Stay here. Don't touch anything.
4,12,CHIEF,"You are really gonna get it tonight, big boy."
4,12,RUBY,I should be asking you the same thing.
4,12,SAM,I'm working a job.
4,12,RUBY,"The whole world's about to be engulfed in hellfire, and you're in Magictown, USA."
4,12,SAM,You got something against magic?
4,12,SAM,And that someone is me?
4,12,RUBY,"Well, you can quit dicking around here, for one. Bigger fish, Sam. And if the seals are being broken, you might want to go after the one doing the breaking."
4,12,SAM,Lilith?
4,12,RUBY,"Cut the head off the snake. You're the only one who can stop her, Sam. So step up and kill the little bitch."
4,12,SAM,"Oh, I'm game, believe me. It's not the psychic thing I got a problem with."
4,12,RUBY,"Yeah, I know what you got a problem with, but tough. It's the only way."
4,12,SAM,No.
4,12,SAM,You don't know what you're talking about.
4,12,RUBY,"Oh I don't, huh? Fine."
4,12,RUBY,"It's simple. Lucifer rises, the apocalypse starts. You think that you have demons on your hands now? People are gonna die, Sam. Oceans of people. So you just let me know when you're ready."
4,12,DEAN,Find anything interesting?
4,12,SAM,"What? Uh, no. You?"
4,12,DEAN,"Nothing I want to talk about, or think about, ever again."
4,12,VERNON,"He's crazy, and you know it."
4,12,VERNON,Did you even try to talk him out of it?
4,12,CHARLIE,"Till I was blue in the face. But I tell you, Vernon, there was...there was something in his eyes."
4,12,VERNON,'In his eyes'? You're both nuts.
4,12,DEAN,"The Chief, huh?"
4,12,CHARLIE,What's the matter? Chief not your type?
4,12,DEAN,"You know, I could have you both arrested for obstruction of justice."
4,12,VERNON,How? You're no Fed.
4,12,CHARLIE,"We con people for a living, son. Takes more than a fake badge to get past us."
4,12,DEAN,"You got us. Yeah, we—we are actually—aspiring magicians."
4,14,TITLE CARD:,
4,14,INT. APARTMENT.,
4,14,INT. HOSPITAL,
4,15,BOBBY,"Sam, Dean, Pamela Barnes. Best damn psychic in the state."
4,15,ALASTAIR,Don't you recognize me? But we were so close.
4,15,DEAN,Alastair.
4,15,ANNA,Lucifer—
4,15,DEAN,"Well, I don't know when it happened, but the Sam I knew—"
4,15,DEAN,The secrets.
4,15,DEAN,What else aren't you telling me?
4,15,SAM,You're holding me back.
4,15,SAM,—go near.
4,15,SAM,"You know I didn't mean the things I said back there, right? That it was just the siren's spell talking?"
4,15,DEAN,Of course. Me too.
4,15,SAM,"So, we're good?"
4,15,DEAN,"Yeah, we're good."
4,15,JIM,"Okay, okay, now, come on, you tell me—now why kick that field goal?"
4,15,PETE,Because it's called football.
4,15,JIM,"No, it's called fantasy football, and those three points screwed me."
4,15,PETE,"Seriously, Jim, you need to get a life."
4,15,YOUNG MAN,"Hey, guys, got any change?"
4,15,JIM,"Sorry, pal."
4,15,YOUNG MAN,How about your wallets?
4,15,PETE,No problem.
4,15,JIM,"Take it easy, all right?"
4,15,YOUNG MAN,Just give me the wallets!
4,15,JIM,"Hold on, man."
4,15,PETE,Jim!
4,15,PETE,Jim! Jim!
4,15,PETE,Call 911! Now!
4,15,PETE,Come on.
4,15,JIM,Hey.
4,15,PETE,"Don't move. Don't move, man."
4,15,JIM,I feel okay.
4,15,PETE,You're not even bleeding.
4,15,JIM,Give me a hand.
4,15,PETE,How you even alive right now?
4,15,JIM,I don't know.
4,15,SAM,"No, no, no, you're right, it's definitely weird. ...Okay, Bobby, thanks."
4,15,DEAN,What's up?
4,15,SAM,Bobby found something in Wyoming.
4,15,DEAN,A job?
4,15,SAM,Maybe.
4,15,SAM,"Small town, no one's died in the past week and a half."
4,15,DEAN,That so unusual?
4,15,SAM,"Well, it's how they're not dying."
4,15,SAM,One guy with terminal cancer strolls right out of hospice.
4,15,SAM,Another guy gets capped by a mugger and walks away without a scratch.
4,15,DEAN,Capped in the ass?
4,15,SAM,Police say Mr. Jenkins was shot in the heart at point-blank range by a nine-millimeter.
4,15,DEAN,And he's not a doughnut?
4,15,SAM,Locals are saying it's a miracle.
4,15,DEAN,Okay.
4,15,SAM,"It's got to be something nasty, right? I mean, people making deals or something."
4,15,DEAN,You think?
4,15,SAM,What else would it be?
4,15,DEAN,I don't know.
4,15,SAM,All right.
4,15,SAM,Get that to go.
4,15,SAM,Come on.
4,15,SAM,What?
4,15,DEAN,Sure you want me going with you?
4,15,SAM,Why wouldn't I?
4,15,DEAN,I don't want to be holding you back or nothing.
4,15,SAM,"Dude, I've told you a hundred times, that was the siren talking, not me."
4,15,SAM,Can we get past this?
4,15,DEAN,"Yeah, we're past it."
4,15,JIM (voiceover),"Now, you two said you were bloggers?"
4,15,SAM,"Yes, sir. Floored by the Lord dot com."
4,15,DEAN,All of God's glory fit to blog.
4,15,SAM,Um. Some of the people around town are saying what happened to you was a miracle.
4,15,JIM,It was. Plain as day.
4,15,SAM,How can you be so sure?
4,15,JIM,How else do you explain it? The doctors can't.
4,15,JIM,"There's a bullet in my heart, and it's pumping like a piston."
4,15,DEAN,"Well, how do you explain it?"
4,15,JIM,"Look, honestly."
4,15,JIM,"I was nobody's saint—not exactly father of the year, either."
4,15,DEAN,Okay.
4,15,JIM,But when that guy shot me and I didn't bleed a drop? I just knew the Lord was giving me a second chance.
4,15,DEAN,That so?
4,15,JIM,I had this feeling—like angels were watching over me.
4,15,JIM,I wouldn't expect you guys to understand.
4,15,DEAN,"Well, we'll just have to try."
4,15,SAM,You wouldn't have happened to have swung by a crossroads in the past week or so?
4,15,"JIM, confused",No.
4,15,SAM,Maybe you met someone? With black eyes? Or red?
4,15,JIM,Who'd you guys say you were again?
4,15,DEAN,Never mind. Thank you for your time.
4,15,SAM,Hey.
4,15,DEAN,Anything?
4,15,SAM,"That cancer survivor? He was clinically dead, his wife pulled the plug, and now he's taking her out for their twentieth anniversary."
4,15,DEAN,Any sign of a deal?
4,15,SAM,No. What about you? Found anyone dying around here?
4,15,DEAN,Not since Cole Griffith.
4,15,DEAN,He dropped ten days ago. It was the last death I could find.
4,15,SAM,"So, what are you thinking?"
4,15,DEAN,"Eh, maybe it is what the people say it is."
4,15,SAM,"Miracles? Dean, our experience, when do miracles just happen?"
4,15,DEAN,"Well, there's no deals. There's, uh, no skeevy faith healers."
4,15,DEAN,"I mean, these souls just ain't getting dragged into the light."
4,15,SAM,Maybe 'cause there's no one around to carry them.
4,15,DEAN,What do you mean?
4,15,SAM,"Well, grim reapers—that's what they do, right? Schlep souls? So, if death ain't in town—"
4,15,DEAN,"Then nobody's dying. So what? The local reaper's on strike? Playing the back nine? I don't know, Sam."
4,15,SAM,"Well, then, let's talk to somebody who might."
4,15,DEAN,"Well, last I checked, huggy bear ain't available."
4,15,SAM,"No, dude, the kid."
4,15,DEAN,The kid? The kid's a doornail.
4,15,SAM,"Exactly. Look, if he was the last person to die around here, then maybe he's seen something. We should talk to him."
4,15,DEAN,I love how matter-of-fact you are about that. Strange lives.
4,15,DEAN,You sure this is gonna work?
4,15,SAM,"No. But if his spirit's around, this should smoke him out."
4,15,SAM,What?
4,15,DEAN,"This job is jacked, that's what."
4,15,SAM,How so?
4,15,DEAN,"You want me to gank a monster or torch a corpse, hey, let's light it up, right? But this? If we fix whatever this is,  people are gonna start dropping dead. Good people."
4,15,SAM,"Look, I don't want them to die, either, Dean, but there's a natural order."
4,15,DEAN,"You're kidding, right?"
4,15,SAM,What?
4,15,SAM,"Yeah, but the normal rules don't really apply to us, do they?"
4,15,DEAN,We're no different than anybody else.
4,15,SAM,I'm infected with demon blood. You've been to hell.
4,15,SAM,"Look, I know you want to think of yourself as Joe the Plumber, Dean, but you're not. Neither am I. The sooner you accept that, the better off you're gonna be."
4,15,DEAN,"Ah, Joe the Plumber was a douche."
4,15,SAM,You gonna help me finish this?
4,15,MAN,Hey!
4,15,MAN,What are you doing here?
4,15,SAM,Uh—
4,15,SAM,Just take it easy.
4,15,MAN,What the hell is this?
4,15,DEAN,"Okay, this—this—this is not what it looks like."
4,15,MAN,Really? 'Cause it looks like devil worship.
4,15,DEAN,"What? No! No, this is not devil worship. This—This is—this—this is, uh—"
4,15,DEAN,I don't have a good answer.
4,15,SAM,We're leaving.
4,15,MAN,You're not going anywhere.
4,15,MAN,Ever again. Sam.
4,15,DEAN,Alastair.
4,15,DEAN,"I thought you got deep fried, extra-crispy."
4,15,ALASTAIR,Nah. Just the pediatrician I was riding. His wife's still looking for him. It's hilarious. Anyway.
4,15,ALASTAIR,No time to chat. Got a hot date with death.
4,15,SAM,Dean!
4,15,ALASTAIR,"You're stronger, Sam. You've been soloflexing with your little slut?"
4,15,SAM,You have no idea.
4,15,SAM,How you doing?
4,15,DEAN,"I'm in pain, that's how I'm doing. I think I have a concussion."
4,15,SAM,You want some aspirin?
4,15,DEAN,"No thanks, House. So, demons, huh?"
4,15,SAM,Yeah. So much for miracles.
4,15,DEAN,And what the hell happened with Alastair again?
4,15,SAM,"I told you, he tried to fling me or whatever."
4,15,SAM,"And it didn't work, so he bailed."
4,15,DEAN,"Well, how come he couldn't fling you? He chucked you pretty good last time."
4,15,SAM,Got no idea.
4,15,DEAN,"Sam, do me a favor. If you're gonna keep your little secrets, I can't really stop you, but just don't treat me like an idiot, okay?"
4,15,SAM,"What? Dean, I'm not keeping secrets."
4,15,DEAN,"Mm-hm. Whatever. So, did you go back and q-and-a the dead kid?"
4,15,SAM,Didn't have to. Bobby called. He did some digging.
4,15,DEAN,And?
4,15,SAM,He thinks I'm right. Local reaper's gone. Not just gone—kidnapped.
4,15,DEAN,By demons? Why?
4,15,SAM,Listen to this.
4,15,SAM,"""And he bloodied death under the newborn sky—sweet to taste, but bitter when once devoured."""
4,15,DEAN,Swanky. What the hell's that mean?
4,15,SAM,"Well, it's from a very obscure, very arcane version of Revelations."
4,15,DEAN,Which means what I think it means?
4,15,SAM,"Basically, you kill a reaper under the solstice moon—tomorrow night, by the way—you got yourself a broken seal."
4,15,DEAN,How do you ice a reaper? You can't kill death.
4,15,SAM,I don't know. Maybe demons can. Where the hell are the angels is what I want to know. We could use their help for once.
4,15,DEAN,It looks like we're gonna have to take care of this one ourselves.
4,15,SAM,"What are we gonna do, just swing in and save the friendly neighborhood reaper?"
4,15,DEAN,"You got a better idea, I'm all ears."
4,15,SAM,"Dean, reapers are invisible. The only people that can see them are the dead and the dying."
4,15,DEAN,"Well, if ghosts are the only ones that can see them..."
4,15,SAM,Yeah?
4,15,DEAN,Then we become ghosts.
4,15,SAM,You do have a concussion.
4,15,DEAN,"Sounds crazy, I know."
4,15,SAM,It is crazy.
4,15,SAM,How?
4,15,PAMELA,I can't even begin to tell you how crazy you two are.
4,15,SAM,"Well, Pamela, you're a sight for sore eyes."
4,15,PAMELA,"Aw, that's sweet, grumpy."
4,15,PAMELA,What do you say to deaf people?
4,15,PAMELA,Which one of you brainiacs came up with astral projection?
4,15,DEAN,Yo.
4,15,PAMELA,Of course. Chachi.
4,15,PAMELA,"So, let's be clear. You want to rip your souls out of your bodies and take a little stroll through the spirit world?"
4,15,DEAN,Mm-hm.
4,15,PAMELA,Do you have any idea how heavy-duty insane that is?
4,15,DEAN,"Maybe, but that's where the reaper is, so..."
4,15,PAMELA,"So, it's nuts."
4,15,DEAN,Not if you know what you're doing.
4,15,PAMELA,You don't know what you're doing.
4,15,DEAN,"No, but you do."
4,15,PAMELA,"Yeah, I do. And guess what? I'm sick of being hauled back into your angel-demon, Soc-Greaser crap."
4,15,DEAN,"Look, I'd love to be kicking back with a cold one, watching Judge Judy, too."
4,15,PAMELA,Nice. More blind jokes?
4,15,DEAN,"You know what I mean. We're talking the end of the world here, okay? No more tasseled leather pants, no more Ramones CDs, no more nothing."
4,15,DEAN,We need your help.
4,15,PAMELA,"Tell me something, geniuses. Even if you do break into the veil and you find the reaper, how you gonna save it?"
4,15,DEAN,With style and class.
4,15,PAMELA,"You're gonna be two walking pieces of fog who can't touch or move anything. You'll be defenseless, hotshot."
4,15,SAM,I seem to recall a bunch of ghosts beating the crap out of us.
4,15,PAMELA,"Yeah, well, they had plenty of time to practice."
4,15,DEAN,"Well, then, I guess we got to start cramming."
4,15,PAMELA,"Wow, couple of heroes. All right."
4,15,PAMELA,Lie down. Close your eyes.
4,15,PAMELA,"Animum vult decipi, ergo decipiatur. Vis, vis, vis. Okay, guys. That's it. Showtime."
4,15,DEAN,"Well, nothing like shooting blanks. What's plan B?"
4,15,DEAN,"Oh, I'm so feeling up Demi Moore."
4,15,PAMELA,"All right, so, I'm assuming you're somewhere over the rainbow. Remember I have to bring you back."
4,15,PAMELA,I'll whisper the incantation in your ear.
4,15,PAMELA,You have got a great ass.
4,15,DEAN,What'd she—
4,15,DEAN,What'd she say?
4,15,DEAN,That was wild.
4,15,DEAN,Am I making you uncomfortable?
4,15,SAM,Get out of me.
4,15,DEAN,You're such a prude. Come on.
4,15,DEAN,"Oh, man, we've been spooking this town for hours. No demons, no black smoke. I say we hit Victoria's Secret and get our peep on, huh?"
4,15,SAM,Hey. Three o'clock. Kid in the window.
4,15,SAM,Am I crazy or is he looking at us?
4,15,DEAN,It's 'cause we've seen him before.
4,15,SAM,We have?
4,15,DEAN,"Newspaper. Cole Griffith, the last person to die in this town."
4,15,MRS. GRIFFITH,Cole?
4,15,MRS. GRIFFITH,"It's Mom. Your dad thinks I'm crazy. Are you here? A picture frame fell over. I could have sworn it was you, baby. Are you still here with me?"
4,15,MRS. GRIFFITH,"Oh, my god!"
4,15,DEAN,Stop! How are you doing that?
4,15,COLE,Who are you?
4,15,SAM,"Relax, Cole. It's okay."
4,15,COLE,How do you know my name?
4,15,SAM,"Look, this isn't gonna be easy to hear, but...you're—dead. You're a spirit. Us too."
4,15,COLE,"Yeah, thanks, Haley Joel. I know I'm dead. What do you want?"
4,15,SAM,We just want to talk.
4,15,COLE,About what?
4,15,COLE,I was outside all morning.
4,15,COLE,They tell you to be careful when it's cold.
4,15,DEAN,Cold air can cause an asthma attack?
4,15,COLE,"But then I was in my room. It happened so fast. I called out for my mom, but nothing came out. Everything started spinning, and then I was just standing there, looking down at my body."
4,15,SAM,And that's when you saw the man?
4,15,COLE,"Creepy old guy in a black suit. He wanted me to go with him, but..."
4,15,COLE,I didn't want to go.
4,15,SAM,Reaper.
4,15,SAM,How'd you get rid of him?
4,15,COLE,I didn't. The black smoke did.
4,15,DEAN,Black smoke?
4,15,COLE,"It was everywhere. I hid in the closet, and when I came out, it was gone, and so was he."
4,15,DEAN,Do you know where the smoke went?
4,15,COLE,No. But I know where it is.
4,15,COLE,They're back.
4,15,DEAN,Who?
4,15,SAM,Another reaper.
4,15,DEAN,Hey! Hey! Wait! We need to talk to you!
4,15,TESSA,Dean.
4,15,DEAN,Do I know you?
4,15,TESSA,We go way back.
4,15,TESSA,You don't remember me?
4,15,DEAN,"Honestly, if I had a nickel for every time I heard a girl say that... You're gonna have to freshen my memory."
4,15,DEAN,Tessa.
4,15,TESSA,"That's one of my names, yeah."
4,15,SAM,"So, you do know her."
4,15,DEAN,From the hospital after the accident.
4,15,SAM,The accident with Dad?
4,15,SAM,"So, this is the reaper that came after you."
4,15,DEAN,Yeah.
4,15,TESSA,"Well, this was fun."
4,15,TESSA,"Now, if you'll excuse me—"
4,15,DEAN,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, you can't—you can't take the kid."
4,15,TESSA,Why?
4,15,DEAN,"Demons are in town, that's why. They've already snatched your reaper pal. The kid knows where."
4,15,TESSA,So?
4,15,SAM,"So, you should shag ass. For all we know, they could try and snatch you, too."
4,15,TESSA,Except that this town is off the rails.
4,15,TESSA,And someone has to set it straight.
4,15,DEAN,"Yeah, we understand that, but these are special circumstances."
4,15,TESSA,What? Your whole angel-demon dance-off? I could care less. I just want to do my job.
4,15,SAM,"Right, yeah, and, look, we want to help you do your job. So, if you would just bail town—"
4,15,TESSA,No.
4,15,DEAN,"Well, then, could you hold off until we fix this? Please."
4,15,TESSA,"All right, but just so we're clear, when I start reaping again, I'm starting with the kid."
4,15,SAM,Understood. I'll find him.
4,15,DEAN,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. What—"
4,15,DEAN,What are you gonna say to him?
4,15,SAM,Whatever I have to.
4,15,SAM,"This all must be pretty overwhelming, huh? Pretty scary, too."
4,15,COLE,The worst is my mom.
4,15,SAM,Must be hard seeing her like this.
4,15,SAM,"She's always coming in here, talking to me, telling me how sad she is. I knock some stuff over to let her know I'm here, but...she only gets sadder."
4,15,SAM,"Well, you might want to ease up on the flying soccer balls."
4,15,COLE,I'm not telling you where the smoke is.
4,15,SAM,"Hey. What if I told you that if you helped me, you wouldn't have to leave here? Ever?"
4,15,COLE,What about the one downstairs?
4,15,SAM,"Tessa? Oh, she wouldn't bother you. No reaper would. You could just stay here with your family for as long as you wanted."
4,15,COLE,You can do that?
4,15,SAM,"Yeah, you bet I can do that."
4,15,COLE,You swear?
4,15,SAM,I swear.
4,15,TESSA,"I'll tell you, life is funny."
4,15,DEAN,What do you mean?
4,15,TESSA,"You and me, together again."
4,15,DEAN,Are you—are you making a move on me?
4,15,TESSA,"You're the one that got away, Dean. You'd be surprised how little that happens to me."
4,15,DEAN,Can I tell you something between you and me?
4,15,TESSA,Who am I gonna tell?
4,15,DEAN,"After our little, uh, experience...for that whole year, I felt like I had this...hole in my gut...like I was missing something. I didn't know what. Do you know what it was?"
4,15,DEAN,It was you. The pain of losing my father and Sammy. I just...I wish I had gone with you for good. But I guess things are different now.
4,15,TESSA,What? The angels on your shoulder?
4,15,DEAN,"So, you know about that, huh? Well, hey, don't get me wrong. I mean, most the ones I've met are dicks with wings. But still... You know, I've done things. Horrible things. And someone upstairs still decided to give me a second chance. It just makes me feel...I don't know."
4,15,TESSA,Uh-huh.
4,15,SAM,"Hey, guys."
4,15,TESSA,"Hey, Cole. I'm Tessa. I'm not going to hurt you."
4,15,SAM,"It's okay, Cole. Just tell them what you told me."
4,15,COLE,I saw the black smoke at my funeral.
4,15,DEAN,At the cemetery?
4,15,COLE,At the funeral home. It was everywhere.
4,15,DEAN,You doing that?
4,15,TESSA,No.
4,15,DEAN,Tessa!
4,15,SAM,"Cole, you okay?"
4,15,DEAN,"Well, how the hell are we supposed to fight that?"
4,15,SAM,I don't know. Learn some ghost moves?
4,15,DEAN,"By tonight? Yeah, sure. I'll meet you back at Mr. Miyagi's."
4,15,COLE,Who's Mr. Miyagi?
4,15,COLE,It's not gonna move if you don't concentrate.
4,15,DEAN,I am concentrating.
4,15,DEAN,"Ah, here we go, baby."
4,15,COLE,You pull a muscle?
4,15,DEAN,"All right, Yoda, let's see what you got."
4,15,DEAN,Dude! You are so Amityville.
4,15,COLE,This isn't even the good stuff.
4,15,COLE,"See? If you want to hit something, you just got to get mad."
4,15,SAM,"Yeah, got it."
4,15,COLE,Now you try. Hit me.
4,15,DEAN,"Uh, I think I'll stick to just picking on somebody my own size."
4,15,COLE,Hit me as hard as you can.
4,15,SAM,"Dude, I'm not gonna do Fight Club with a twelve-year-old."
4,15,SAM,"All right, cut it out."
4,15,COLE,Make me.
4,15,DEAN,"Whoa. Whoa, you got to teach us that."
4,15,SAM,Maybe it's demon invisible ink. Only see it in the veil.
4,15,DEAN,Any idea what it's for?
4,15,SAM,We'll find out.
4,15,DEAN,"Dude, check me out."
4,15,DEAN,"You know, this ghost thing, it's, it's kind of rad."
4,15,SAM,It's iron.
4,15,DEMON,Boys. Find the place okay?
4,15,ALASTAIR,"Rock salt's not so much fun anymore, is it?"
4,15,DEAN,Alastair. You bastard.
4,15,ALASTAIR,"Well, go on. Why don't you try some of your mojo on me now, hotshot?"
4,15,ALASTAIR,"It's hard to get it up when you're not wearing your meat, huh?"
4,15,SAM,Go to hell.
4,15,ALASTAIR,"Ah, if only I could."
4,15,ALASTAIR,But they just keep sending me back up to this arctic craphole.
4,15,DEAN,To kill death?
4,15,ALASTAIR,"No, to kill death twice. It takes two to break a seal. I figured another one would show up, though. They're like lemmings."
4,15,ALASTAIR,"By the way, it's, uh, good to see you again, Dean."
4,15,DEAN,"You can shoot us all you want, but you can't kill us."
4,15,ALASTAIR,"Ah, that so?"
4,15,ALASTAIR,Anyhoo...
4,15,ALASTAIR,"Moon's in the right spot. The board is set. Let's get started, shall we?"
4,15,DEAN,"You're gonna kill a reaper with that? It's little on the nose, don't you think?"
4,15,ALASTAIR,"Is it? An old friend lent it to me. You know, he doesn't really ride a pale horse? But he does have three amigos."
4,15,ALASTAIR,And they're just jonesing for the apocalypse.
4,15,ALASTAIR,It pays to have friends in low places.
4,15,ALASTAIR,Don't you think?
4,15,ALASTAIR,"Hic cruor messorius, illud sigillum, quod luciferem reverendum obstringit, aperiat ut resurgat!"
4,15,TESSA,Stop!
4,15,ALASTAIR,Hic cruor messorius—
4,15,PAMELA,"I know you're here. What's the matter, you reeking son of a bitch? You afraid of a skirt?"
4,15,PAMELA,"Vis, vis, vis!"
4,15,PAMELA,Son of a bitch!
4,15,ALASTAIR,"—illud sigillum, quod luciferem reverendum obstringit—"
4,15,ALASTAIR,—aperiat ut—
4,15,ALASTAIR,—resurgat!
4,15,DEAN,Bye-bye.
4,15,TESSA,Where's your brother?
4,15,DEAN,I'll go find him. You get out of here.
4,15,PAMELA,"Animum vult decipi, ergo—"
4,15,SAM,Pamela!
4,15,SAM,What's so funny?
4,15,PAMELA,I can't die—not in this town.
4,15,SAM,Pamela—
4,15,PAMELA,"Quit your worrying, grumpy. How about you make me a drink, huh?"
4,15,SAM,You need a doctor.
4,15,PAMELA,"Make me a drink, Sam."
4,15,ALASTAIR,You can't run.
4,15,ALASTAIR,Dean.
4,15,ALASTAIR,Not from me. I'm inside that angsty little noggin of yours.
4,15,DEAN,What the hell?
4,15,CASTIEL,Guess again.
4,15,CASTIEL,"What just happened? You and Sam just saved a seal. We captured Alastair. Dean, this was a victory."
4,15,DEAN,"Well, no thanks to you."
4,15,CASTIEL,What makes you say that?
4,15,DEAN,You were here the whole time?
4,15,CASTIEL,Enough of it.
4,15,DEAN,"Well, thanks for your help with the rock salt."
4,15,CASTIEL,That script on the funeral home—we couldn't penetrate it.
4,15,DEAN,That was angel-proofing.
4,15,CASTIEL,Why do you think I recruited you and Sam in the first place?
4,15,DEAN,You recruited us?
4,15,CASTIEL,"That wasn't your friend Bobby who called, Dean. It wasn't Bobby who told Sam about the seal."
4,15,DEAN,That was you?
4,15,DEAN,"If you want our help, why the hell didn't you just ask?"
4,15,CASTIEL,"Because whatever I ask, you seem to do the exact opposite."
4,15,DEAN,"So, what now, huh? The people in this town, they just gonna start dying again?"
4,15,CASTIEL,Yes.
4,15,DEAN,"These are good people. What, you think you can make a few exceptions?"
4,15,CASTIEL,To everything there is a season.
4,15,DEAN,You made an exception for me.
4,15,CASTIEL,You're different.
4,15,TESSA,Dean? I could use your help.
4,15,TESSA,"Hey, Cole."
4,15,COLE,Tell your brother thanks for nothing.
4,15,TESSA,"Look at her, Cole."
4,15,TESSA,Do you see how unhappy she is?
4,15,COLE,That's why I want to stay with her.
4,15,TESSA,"As long as she can feel you, she'll be in pain, because she can't let go."
4,15,TESSA,Because you won't let go of her.
4,15,COLE,Why won't anybody tell me what's on the other side?
4,15,TESSA,Maybe nobody wants to ruin the surprise.
4,15,COLE,That's not an answer.
4,15,DEAN,"She won't answer you, Cole. Reapers never do. But trust me. Staying here is a whole lot worse than anything over there."
4,15,COLE,Why?
4,15,DEAN,"Because one day, your family will be gone, and there'll be nothing left here for you. It's okay to be scared."
4,15,COLE,I'm not scared.
4,15,DEAN,We're all scared. That's the big secret. We're all scared.
4,15,COLE,Are you coming?
4,15,DEAN,"Oh, I'm sure I'll be there sooner than you think."
4,15,DEAN,Look out for that boy.
4,15,TESSA,"Look out for yourself, Dean."
4,15,DEAN,What do you mean?
4,15,TESSA,"I've been around death from the get-go. You know what I see most? Lies. ""He's in a better place."" ""At least they're together now."" You all lie to yourselves, Dean, 'cause like you said, deep down, you're all scared. Stop lying to yourself, Dean."
4,15,DEAN,What?
4,15,TESSA,"The angels have something good in store for you. A second chance. Really? 'Cause I'm pretty sure, deep down, you know something nasty's coming down the road. Trust your instincts, Dean. There's no such thing as miracles."
4,15,DEAN,What are you saying?
4,15,PAMELA,"Imum vult decipi, ergo decipiatur. Vis, vis, vis."
4,15,SAM,"Hey, we just got to talk to Tessa, that's all. Get her to hold off reaping till we get you better."
4,15,PAMELA,I'm pretty sure she's started up again.
4,15,DEAN,What happened?
4,15,SAM,"Dean, where's Tessa?"
4,15,DEAN,She's...
4,15,SAM,"Pamela, I'm so sorry."
4,15,PAMELA,Stop.
4,15,SAM,You don't deserve this.
4,15,PAMELA,"Yeah, I don't. I told you I didn't want anything to do with this. Do me a favor? Tell that bastard Bobby Singer—to go to hell for ever introducing me to you two in the first place."
4,15,DEAN,"Take it easy, Pamela. If it's any consolation, you're going to a better place."
4,15,PAMELA,You're lying.
4,15,PAMELA,"But what the hell, right? Everybody's got to go sometime."
4,15,PAMELA,Come here.
4,15,PAMELA,"I know what you did to that demon, Sam."
4,15,PAMELA,"I can feel what's inside of you. If you think you have good intentions, think again."
4,15,SAM,Pamela?
4,15,DEAN,Pamela!
4,15,DEAN,What did she say to you?
4,17,RADIO,NPR Morning Edition. It's time for this waste and—
4,17,DEAN,"Net profitability aside, it's the client-retention rate that concerns me vis-à-vis maximizing return on sales. Buzz me back once you've seen the spreadsheets."
4,17,DEAN,Mr. Adler.
4,17,ADLER,Dean.
4,17,ADLER,Good stuff.
4,17,DEAN,Good stuff?
4,17,ADLER,Big things. Good stuff.
4,17,DEAN,Good stuff.
4,17,DEAN,"Oh I hear you. No, I haven't been to the gym in ages. Carrying a little bloat around myself. It's a sedentary lifestyle, my man, no two ways. —All right, tell me one more time. You said lemon and—what was it? Cayenne and maple syrup, are you serious? How much did you lose?"
4,17,SAM,Do I know you?
4,17,DEAN,I don't think so.
4,17,SAM,"I'm sorry, man, you just look really familiar."
4,17,DEAN,"Save it for the health club, pal."
4,17,SAM,"Tech support, this is Sam Wesson. Okay. Uh, well, did you try turning it off and then on?"
4,17,SAM,"Okay, go ahead and turn it off. No no no, just, just off. All right, give it a second. Turn it back on. Okay, is it printing now? Great. Anytime."
4,17,MAN,Hey.
4,17,SAM,Yo.
4,17,MAN,What do you think of Mimi?
4,17,SAM,She's okay.
4,17,MAN,Might have to hit that.
4,17,SAM,"Oh, dude, that's totally age-inappropriate."
4,17,MAN,Experience.
4,17,SAM,Trifocals.
4,17,MAN,"There's a MILF there, Sam. I just know it. Maybe a GMILF."
4,17,SAM,Come on.
4,17,MAN,Coffee break?
4,17,SAM,"Yeah, for sure."
4,17,MAN,"Paul. Time for a refuel, buddy."
4,17,PAUL,"Sorry, no time."
4,17,MAN,"Since when? Dude, we get paid by the hour."
4,17,PAUL,Working.
4,17,MAN,Okay.
4,17,SAM,He seems stressed.
4,17,MAN,Freaked because he got busted surfing porn on the Internet.
4,17,SAM,"No, no, no way. When?"
4,17,MAN,Got sent up to HR yesterday. Guess they put the fear of God in him.
4,17,SAM,"Ian, dude."
4,17,IAN,Just doing a little shopping. Running low at home.
4,17,IAN,"So, Sam, had any of those dreams lately?"
4,17,IAN,What? Don't be like that. Come on. It's the highlight of my day.
4,17,SAM,I never should have told you in the first place.
4,17,IAN,"They're genius. Don't hold out on me, dude. Share with the class."
4,17,SAM,You're just gonna be a dick about it.
4,17,IAN,What? No way. I won't say a word. Total respect. Go.
4,17,IAN,"Classic! How much D&D did you play when you were a kid? Oh, my—okay, so you—rescuing the Grim Reaper. That's—you're a hero. I mean, thank God we got Harry Potter here to save us all from the apocalypse."
4,17,SAM,Dick.
4,17,IAN,Wizard.
4,17,SAM,Can I ask you a question?
4,17,DEAN,"Look, man, I told you, I'm not into the, uh—"
4,17,SAM,"Oh dude, come on, I'm not either. I just wanna ask you one question."
4,17,DEAN,Sure.
4,17,SAM,What do you think about ghosts?
4,17,DEAN,Ghosts?
4,17,SAM,Do you believe in them?
4,17,DEAN,"Uh, tell you the truth, I've never given it much thought."
4,17,SAM,Vampires?
4,17,DEAN,What? Why?
4,17,SAM,Because I've been having some weird dreams lately. You know what I mean?
4,17,DEAN,No. Not really.
4,17,SAM,So you've never had any...weird dreams?
4,17,DEAN,"All right, look, man, I don't know you, okay? But I'm gonna do a public service and, uh, let you know that—that you overshare."
4,17,SAM,"Did you turn it off, then on?"
4,17,SAM,"All right, well, let's try that. No, no, it's fine, I'll wait."
4,17,SAM,"Is it printing now? Oh, that's great. Anytime."
4,17,IAN,Whatcha doing?
4,17,SAM,Nothing.
4,17,IAN,You get an email from Human Resources?
4,17,SAM,No. Why?
4,17,IAN,"Damn it. Guess it's just me, then. I'm supposed to, quote, report to HR, unquote."
4,17,SAM,They're probably finally busting you for snaking all those office supplies.
4,17,IAN,I hope they spank me.
4,17,PAUL,No no no no no no. Come on. Don't do this to me. Please.
4,17,SAM,"Hey, man, you okay?"
4,17,PAUL,It froze.
4,17,SAM,"They're crap, Paul. They freeze all the time."
4,17,PAUL,"You don't understand. When I, when I rebooted, everything was gone. A whole day's work deleted."
4,17,SAM,"Well, did you back up?"
4,17,PAUL,"No, I didn't back up. I wish to God I backed up but I didn't. I'll get it back. I'll find it. It's somewhere. I'll find it."
4,17,SAM,"Paul, it's okay, man. These things happen."
4,17,PAUL,Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Please. Please.
4,17,PAUL,All that work. Gone. Failed.
4,17,DEAN,Something about this seem not right to you?
4,17,SUIT,"Uh, yeah, try the whole thing. I'm telling you, man, I'll never eat popcorn again."
4,17,DEAN,"Yeah, right."
4,17,DEAN,Two weeks?
4,17,SAM,"Hey. Why would someone kill themselves two weeks before they were supposed to retire? I mean, Paul was two weeks from freedom. He should have been happy, right?"
4,17,IAN,"I don't have time for this, Sam."
4,17,SAM,That's very funny.
4,17,SAM,What's with you?
4,17,IAN,I'm working. It's important.
4,17,SAM,HR bust your balls or something? You're wearing the shirt. Did you shave?
4,17,IAN,"Tech support, this is Ian. Be right up. Gotta go up to twenty-two, speak to a manager."
4,17,DEAN,"Hi. Ian, is it? Yeah, come on in. Yesterday you filled out a 445-T and no problem, just a few errors when we did your switch over to Vista. So I'm sure you're used to filling out the dash-R's, am I right?"
4,17,IAN,"Oh, no."
4,17,DEAN,No no no. It's fine. It's fine. I just need you to redo one today so I can get the show on the road with the invoicing.
4,17,IAN,Oh my god.
4,17,DEAN,"No, it's fine. Just refile it and we're square."
4,17,IAN,I can't believe I did this.
4,17,IAN,I can't believe I—I can't believe I did this.
4,17,DEAN,"Hey, guy, come on."
4,17,IAN,"No, no. It affected profits. It—I screwed up. I—I can't—I can't—I am so sorry. I—how could I do that? I failed Sandover. I failed the company."
4,17,DEAN,"All right, why don't you sit down, Ian?"
4,17,IAN,No.
4,17,DEAN,Ian? Ian. Hey.
4,17,DEAN,"Ian, hey. Just chill out, man. Okay?"
4,17,DEAN,"Ian, hey, maybe we should get out of here, huh? Come on. Ian. Look at me."
4,17,DEAN,Somebody help me!
4,17,DEAN,"No, I, I followed him into the bathroom."
4,17,DEAN,"He was, uh—he was standing there in front of the mirror, and then—"
4,17,OFFICER,Continue. Sir.
4,17,DEAN,"And he stabbed himself in the neck. I'm sorry, that's, um..."
4,17,SAM,"Tech support, this is Sam."
4,17,DEAN,I need to see you in my office. Now.
4,17,DEAN,Come on in. Shut the door.
4,17,DEAN,Who the hell are you?
4,17,SAM,I'm not sure I know.
4,17,DEAN,What the hell does that mean?
4,17,SAM,Sam Wesson. I started here three weeks ago.
4,17,DEAN,All right. You cornered me in the elevator talking about ghosts. And now...
4,17,SAM,Now what?
4,17,DEAN,"Now nothing. I, uh...so you started working here three weeks ago, huh?"
4,17,DEAN,"Yeah, me too."
4,17,DEAN,It's the Master Cleanse. You tried it? Phenomenal. Detoxes you like nobody's business.
4,17,SAM,"When you were in that bathroom with Ian, did you see something?"
4,17,DEAN,I don't know. I don't know what I saw.
4,17,SAM,Wait. Are you saying that—did you see a ghost?
4,17,DEAN,I was freaking out. The guy penciled his damn neck.
4,17,SAM,"You did, didn't you? Okay, listen. What if these suicides aren't suicides? I mean, what if they're something not natural?"
4,17,DEAN,"So, what, ghosts are real? And they're responsible for all the dead bodies around here? Is that what you're telling me?"
4,17,SAM,I know it sounds crazy. But yes. That's what I'm telling you.
4,17,DEAN,Uh-huh. Based on what?
4,17,SAM,Instinct.
4,17,DEAN,I've got the same instinct.
4,17,SAM,Seriously? You know those dreams I was telling you about? I was dreaming about ghosts.
4,17,DEAN,Yeah.
4,17,SAM,And then it turns out that there's a real ghost.
4,17,DEAN,So you're telling me that your dreams are special visions and you're some kind of psychic?
4,17,SAM,"No. I mean, that would be nuts. I'm just saying something weird is definitely going on around here, right? So I've been digging around a little."
4,17,SAM,I think I found a connection between the two guys.
4,17,DEAN,You broke into their email accounts?
4,17,SAM,I used some skills that I happen to have to satisfy my curiosity.
4,17,DEAN,Nice.
4,17,SAM,"Yeah. Okay. So it turns out Ian and Paul both got this same email telling them to report to HR, room fourteen forty-four."
4,17,DEAN,HR's on seven.
4,17,SAM,Exactly.
4,17,DEAN,Should we go check this out?
4,17,SAM,Like right now?
4,17,DEAN,"No. No, it's getting late. You're right."
4,17,SAM,I am dying to check this out right now.
4,17,DEAN,Right?
4,17,MAN,Hello? Hello?
4,17,DEAN,Whoa.
4,17,SAM,How'd you know how to do that?
4,17,DEAN,I have no idea.
4,17,DEAN,"Holy crap, dude."
4,17,SAM,Yeah. I could use a beer.
4,17,DEAN,"Oh, sorry, man. I'm on the Cleanse. I got rid of all the carbs in the house."
4,17,SAM,Hey. How the hell did you know that ghosts are scared of wrenches?
4,17,DEAN,"Crazy, right? And nice job kicking that door too. That was very Jet Li. What are you, like a black belt or something?"
4,17,SAM,No. I have no clue how I did that. It's like...we've done this before.
4,17,DEAN,"What do you mean, before? Like Shirley MacLaine before?"
4,17,SAM,No. I—I just can't shake this feeling like I—like I don't belong here. You know? Like I should do something more than sit in a cubicle.
4,17,DEAN,I think most people who work in a cubicle feel that same way.
4,17,SAM,"No. Well, look, it's more than that. Like, I don't like my job. I don't like this town. I don't like my clothes. I don't like my own last name. I don't know how else to explain it, except that...it feels like I should be doing something else. There's just something in my blood. Like I was destined for something different. What about you? You ever feel that way?"
4,17,DEAN,"I don't believe in destiny. I do believe in dealing with what's right in front of us, though."
4,17,SAM,"All right, so, what do we do now?"
4,17,DEAN,"We do what I do best, Sammy. Research."
4,17,SAM,Okay. Did you just call me Sammy?
4,17,DEAN,Did I?
4,17,SAM,I think you did. Yeah. Don't.
4,17,DEAN,Sorry.
4,17,DEAN,"Oh, jackpot."
4,17,SAM,What you got?
4,17,DEAN,"I just found the best site ever. Real, actual ghost hunters."
4,17,DEAN,These guys are genius. Check it out.
4,17,SAM,Instructional videos.
4,17,ED,We know why you're watching.
4,17,HARRY,You've got a problem.
4,17,ED,A ghost problem.
4,17,HARRY,A ghost-related problem. A ghost—it's like a ghost-adjacent pr—it's like a problem that's—and the ghost is—
4,17,ED,"Whatever. You've come to the right place. The only decent place, really, because the Ghostfacers know how to solve it."
4,17,HARRY,Period.
4,17,ED,Watch and learn.
4,17,HARRY,"See, the first step in any supernatural fight:"
4,17,DEAN,That's him. That's the ghost.
4,17,SAM,"P. T. Sandover. Died 1916. Devoted his life to his work. No wife, no kids."
4,17,SAM,"Used to say he was the company, and his very blood pumped through the building."
4,17,DEAN,"Wow, okay. So slight workaholic. Maybe he's still here, you know, watching over the company, even killing for it."
4,17,SAM,"Plus, turns out this isn't the first time people started killing themselves in the building. 1929."
4,17,DEAN,"Yeah, but lots of guys jumped off lots of high rises that year."
4,17,SAM,How many companies had seventeen suicides?
4,17,DEAN,"Phew. Okay, so P. T. Sandover, protector of the company. His ghost wakes up and becomes active during times of grave economic distress."
4,17,SAM,"Well, I mean, the worst time we've seen since the Great Depression—"
4,17,DEAN,"Is now. Yeah, now sucks. My portfolio's in the sewer. I don't even wanna talk about it."
4,17,SAM,So Sandover's helping the bottom line—
4,17,DEAN,By zapping some model employees.
4,17,SAM,"Yeah. I mean, Ian and Paul. It was like he turned them into different people."
4,17,DEAN,"Perfect worker bees, exactly. So devoted to the company that they would commit hara-kiri if they failed it."
4,17,SAM,"One more interesting fact. The building wasn't always that high. Used to be fourteen floors. And the room where the ghost attacked, fourteen forty-four? Once upon a time, that was the old man's office."
4,17,HARRY,Once you've got that thing in your sights—
4,17,HARRY,Using special ghost-hunting weapons.
4,17,ED,"First, salt. It's like acid to ghosts."
4,17,HARRY,Burny acid.
4,17,ED,Not LSD.
4,17,HARRY,"No. It's a bad trip for ghosts. Next up, iron."
4,17,SAM,That's why the wrench worked.
4,17,ED,Pure power in your hand.
4,17,HARRY,Dissipates ghosts instantly.
4,17,ED,Next little trick. We learned this from those useless douchebags—
4,17,HARRY,That we hate.
4,17,ED,The Winchesters.
4,17,HARRY,Gun.
4,17,ED,Shotgun shell. Pack it up with fresh rock salt.
4,17,HARRY,Very effective.
4,17,ED,Very effective.
4,17,HARRY,"Winchesters still suck ass, though."
4,17,ED,Affirmative. Suckage major.
4,17,DEAN,Where do we even get a gun?
4,17,SAM,Gun store?
4,17,DEAN,Isn't there like some kind of waiting period or something?
4,17,SAM,I think so.
4,17,DEAN,"Well, how in the hell—"
4,17,SAM,"I don't know. Seems pretty impossible, honestly."
4,17,DEAN,Right.
4,17,ED,The aforementioned super-annoying Winchester douchenozzles also taught us this one other thing. You have to burn the remains.
4,17,HARRY,"Okay, this next part gets a little gross. Sometimes you might have to dig up the body. Sorry."
4,17,ED,It's illegal in some states.
4,17,HARRY,All states.
4,17,ED,Possibly all states.
4,17,SAM,Sandover was cremated.
4,17,DEAN,What? So what do we do now?
4,17,HARRY,"Now, if the deceased has been cremated—"
4,17,ED,Don't panic.
4,17,HARRY,Don't panic.
4,17,ED,Just gotta look for some other remains.
4,17,HARRY,"A hair in a locket, maybe. Fingernails. Baby teeth."
4,17,ED,Milk teeth.
4,17,HARRY,Genetic material. You know what we're talking about.
4,17,ED,Go find it.
4,17,HARRY,"Fight well, young lions."
4,17,ED,Godspeed.
4,17,DEAN,Set your cell phone to walkie-talkie in case we get separated.
4,17,SAM,How the hell are we gonna find some ancient speck of DNA in a skyscraper?
4,17,DEAN,"Well, that creepy storeroom used to be Sandover's office, right?"
4,17,GUARD,What the hell are you doing here?
4,17,SAM,Nothing. I just—
4,17,GUARD,Come with me.
4,17,SAM,"Man, listen. Look. It's okay. I—I work here."
4,17,GUARD,Whatever. Tell it to the cops.
4,17,GUARD,"Well, come on."
4,17,SAM,What?
4,17,GUARD,"Last time this happened, it took them two hours to get here."
4,17,SAM,Let's just wait.
4,17,SAM,"Seriously, I'll wait."
4,17,GUARD,"Look, I don't have the rest of my life."
4,17,SAM,Call you back.
4,17,SAM,"Dean, you there?"
4,17,DEAN,"Yeah, listen, I think I got it. Meet me on twenty-two."
4,17,SAM,"Okay, yeah. Just, uh, take the stairs."
4,17,DEAN,Whoa. That's a lot of blood.
4,17,SAM,"Yeah, I know."
4,17,DEAN,"Right. So, uh, in there."
4,17,SAM,P. T. Sandover's gloves.
4,17,DEAN,"Yeah, how much you wanna bet there's a little smidge of DNA in there? You know, like a fingernail clipping or a hair or two? Something."
4,17,SAM,So you ready?
4,17,DEAN,I have no idea.
4,17,SAM,Me neither.
4,17,SAM,Go for it.
4,17,DEAN,Right.
4,17,DEAN,Oh. Nice.
4,17,SAM,Dean.
4,17,SAM,Nice catch.
4,17,DEAN,Right?
4,17,SAM,That was amazing.
4,17,DEAN,Right? Right?
4,17,DEAN,"Man, I gotta tell you, I've never had so much fun in my life."
4,17,SAM,Me neither.
4,17,DEAN,"Was a hell of a workout too, wasn't it?"
4,17,SAM,We should keep doing this.
4,17,DEAN,I know.
4,17,SAM,I mean it. There gotta be other ghosts out there. We could help a lot of people.
4,17,DEAN,"Right, we'd be like the Ghostfacers."
4,17,SAM,"No, really. I mean, for real."
4,17,DEAN,"What? Like, quit our jobs and hit the road?"
4,17,SAM,Exactly.
4,17,DEAN,How would we live?
4,17,SAM,Uh...
4,17,DEAN,You gotta be kidding me. How would we get by? With stolen credit cards? Huh? Eating diner food drenched in saturated fats? Sharing a crap motel room every night?
4,17,SAM,That's all just details.
4,17,DEAN,Details are everything. You don't wanna go fighting ghosts without any health insurance.
4,17,SAM,All right. Um. Confession.
4,17,DEAN,What?
4,17,SAM,Remember those dreams I told you about with the ghosts?
4,17,DEAN,Yeah?
4,17,SAM,I was fighting them.
4,17,DEAN,Okay.
4,17,SAM,"With you. We were these, like, hunters, and we were friends. More like brothers, really. I mean, what if that's who we really are? I mean, you saw us back there, working together. The ghost was scrambling people's brains. What if it scrambled ours?"
4,17,DEAN,That's insane.
4,17,SAM,"Is it? Think about it for just one second. What if we think this is our life, but it's not?"
4,17,DEAN,"Hey, man, the ghost is dead and we're still standing. I mean, I'm sorry, but—"
4,17,SAM,"Look, all I know is this isn't who we're supposed to be."
4,17,DEAN,"No. I'm Dean Smith, okay? Director of Sales and Marketing. I went to Stanford. My father's name is Bob, my mother's name is Ellen, and my sister's name is Jo."
4,17,SAM,When was the last time you talked to them? To any of them?
4,17,DEAN,"Okay, you're upset. You're upset, you're confused—"
4,17,SAM,"Yeah, 'cause I only moved here 'cause I just broke up with my fiancée, Madison. But I called her number and I got a damn animal hospital."
4,17,DEAN,Okay. What are you saying? Are you trying to say that my family isn't real? Huh? That we've been injected with fake memories? Come on.
4,17,SAM,"All I know is, I got this feeling in my gut. And I know—I know that deep down, you gotta be feeling it too. We're supposed to be something else. You're not just some corporate douchebag. This isn't you. I know you."
4,17,DEAN,"Know me? You don't know me, pal. You should go."
4,17,SAM,I quit.
4,17,ADLER,Got a minute?
4,17,DEAN,"Sure, of course."
4,17,ADLER,"How are you feeling, Dean?"
4,17,DEAN,"Uh, great."
4,17,ADLER,"You look a little tired. Been working hard, I gather."
4,17,DEAN,Yeah.
4,17,ADLER,"Ah, don't be modest. I hear everything. And I'm pleased with what I'm hearing."
4,17,ADLER,That's why it's important to me that you're happy.
4,17,ADLER,How's that for a bonus?
4,17,DEAN,That's very generous.
4,17,ADLER,Purely selfish. Wanna make sure you're not going anywhere.
4,17,DEAN,Wow. Are you sure?
4,17,ADLER,"Positive. You are Sandover material, son. Real go-getter. Carving your own way."
4,17,DEAN,"Well, thanks. I try."
4,17,ADLER,"I see big things in your future. Maybe even senior VP, Eastern Great Lakes Division. Don't get me wrong, you'll have to work for it. Seven days a week, lunch at your desk, but in eight to ten short years, that could be you."
4,17,DEAN,"Uh, well, thank you. Thank you, sir. It's, um...but..."
4,17,DEAN,I am giving my notice.
4,17,ADLER,"This is a joke. You're kidding me, right?"
4,17,DEAN,"No. I've—I recently—uh, very recently realized that I have some other work I have to do. It's, uh, very important to me."
4,17,ADLER,Other work? Another company?
4,17,DEAN,"No, I—it's hard to explain. Um. It's just that this—this is—it's just—it's not who I'm supposed to be."
4,17,DEAN,What?
4,17,ADLER,"Dean, Dean, Dean. Finally."
4,17,DEAN,"What the hell? Why am I wearing a tie? My God, am I hungry."
4,17,ADLER,Welcome back.
4,17,DEAN,"Wait. Did I—did I just get touched by—you're an angel, aren't you?"
4,17,ADLER,I'm Zachariah.
4,17,DEAN,"Oh, great. That's all I need is another one of you guys."
4,17,ZACHARIAH,"I'm hardly another one, Dean. I'm Castiel's superior. Believe me, I had no interest in popping down here into one of these smelly things."
4,17,ZACHARIAH,"But after the unfortunate situation with Uriel, I felt it necessary to pay a visit. Get my ducks in a row."
4,17,DEAN,I am not one of your ducks.
4,17,ZACHARIAH,Starting with your attitude.
4,17,DEAN,"Oh, so, what? This was all some sort of a lesson? Is that what you're telling me? Wow. Very creative."
4,17,ZACHARIAH,You should see my decoupage.
4,17,DEAN,"Gross. No thank you. So, what? I'm just hallucinating all this? Is that it?"
4,17,ZACHARIAH,"Not at all. Real place, real haunting. Just plunked you in the middle without the benefit of your memories."
4,17,DEAN,Just to shake things up? Hm? So you guys can have fun watching us run around like ass clowns in monkey suits?
4,17,ZACHARIAH,"To prove to you that the path you're on is truly in your blood. You're a hunter. Not because your dad made you, not because God called you back from hell, but because it is what you are. And you love it. You'll find your way to it in the dark every single time and you're miserable without it. Dean, let's be real here. You're good at this. You'll be successful. You will stop it."
4,17,DEAN,"Stop what? The apocalypse, huh? Lucifer? What? Be specific, man."
4,17,ZACHARIAH,"You'll do everything you're destined to do. All of it. But I know, I know. You're not strong enough. You're scared. You got daddy issues. You can't do it. Right?"
4,17,DEAN,"Angel or not, I will stab you in your face."
4,17,ZACHARIAH,All I'm saying is it's how you look at it. Most folks live and die without moving anything more than the dirt it takes to bury them. You get to change things.
4,17,ZACHARIAH,"Save people, maybe even the world. All the while you drive a classic car and fornicate with women. This isn't a curse. It's a gift. So for God's sakes, Dean, quit whining about it. Look around. There are plenty of fates worse than yours. So are you with me? You wanna go steam yourself another latte? Or are you ready to stand up and be who you really are?"
4,19,JOHN,"You left. Your brother and me, we needed you. You walked away, Sam. You walked away!"
4,19,SAM,"You're the one who said ""don't come back"", Dad. You're the one who closed that door, not me!"
4,19,JOHN,"Sammy, I just couldn't accept the fact that you and me—we're just different."
4,19,SAM,We're not different. Not anymore.
4,19,SAM,"Ruby, it's been weeks. I need it."
4,19,DEAN,How far from normal? From human?
4,19,CASTIEL,"Your brother is headed down a dangerous road, Dean."
4,19,DEAN,"It's already gone too far, Sam. If I didn't know you, I would want to hunt you."
4,19,KATE,No! Go away!
4,19,KATE,"Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, god. It's okay. It's okay."
4,19,SAM,Hey. How'd you sleep?
4,19,DEAN,How do you think? I'm starving. Let's get breakfast.
4,19,SAM,Where? We're like two hours from anything.
4,19,DEAN,But I'm hungry now.
4,19,SAM,There's probably still a sandwich in the back seat.
4,19,DEAN,It's tuna.
4,19,SAM,Isn't that Dad's phone?
4,19,DEAN,Hello?
4,19,ADAM,"Uh, is this John?"
4,19,DEAN,He can't come to the phone. Can I help you?
4,19,ADAM,No no no—I really—I need to talk to John. This is Adam Milligan. He knows me.
4,19,DEAN,"Well, sorry to be the one to break this to you, pal, but John died more than two years ago."
4,19,DEAN,Who is this?
4,19,ADAM,I'm his son.
4,19,SAM,"Dean, look, best I can tell, Adam Milligan is real."
4,19,SAM,"Um, born September twenty-ninth, 1990 to Kate Milligan. No father listed on the birth certificate. He's an Eagle Scout."
4,19,SAM,"Graduated from high school with honors and currently goes to the University of Wisconsin—biology major, pre-med."
4,19,SAM,Dean? You listening?
4,19,DEAN,This is a trap.
4,19,SAM,"Dean, I'm telling you, the kid checks out."
4,19,DEAN,"Great, so he's an actual person on the planet Earth. Sucks he's got a demon in him."
4,19,DENISE,Hi. Welcome to Cousin Oliver's.
4,19,SAM,Thanks.
4,19,DENISE,Can I—
4,19,DEAN,We're actually waiting on somebody.
4,19,SAM,Thank you—
4,19,SAM,What are you—
4,19,SAM,Holy water?
4,19,DEAN,Yup.
4,19,DEAN,"One sip of Jesus juice, this evil bitch is gonna be in a world of hurt."
4,19,SAM,And what if he's not possessed?
4,19,DEAN,Then he is a shapeshifter.
4,19,SAM,Hence the silver.
4,19,DEAN,"Look, either way, this thing is gonna bleed. I mean, using Dad as bait? That's the last mistake of its short, pitiful life."
4,19,DEAN,What?
4,19,DEAN,What?
4,19,SAM,Dean...listen. There's an entry in Dad's journal.
4,19,SAM,"From January of 1990, saying he's headed to Minnesota to check out a case. That's, roughly, oh, about nine months before the kid was born."
4,19,DEAN,Coincidence.
4,19,SAM,Coincidence. Next two pages of the journal—torn out.
4,19,DEAN,"You're not actually buying this, are you?"
4,19,SAM,"Look, man, I don't want to believe it either, I'm just saying it's possible."
4,19,SAM,"I mean, Dad would be gone for weeks at a time, and he wasn't exactly a monk."
4,19,SAM,"I mean, a hunter rolls into town, kills a monster, saves the girl...sometimes the girl's grateful."
4,19,DEAN,"Well, now I’m thinking about Dad sex. Stop talking."
4,19,SAM,Maybe he slipped one past the goalie.
4,19,DEAN,Dude!
4,19,SAM,Adam?
4,19,ADAM,You Sam?
4,19,SAM,"Yeah. Uh, this is Dean."
4,19,ADAM,Hey.
4,19,ADAM,"So, um...how did you know my dad?"
4,19,SAM,"Uh, we worked together."
4,19,ADAM,How did he die?
4,19,SAM,On the job.
4,19,ADAM,"He was a mechanic, right?"
4,19,DEAN,A car fell on him.
4,19,DENISE,"Hey, Adam. How you doing?"
4,19,DEAN,"Oh, I’ll take that. I am very thirsty."
4,19,DENISE,"The usual, Adam?"
4,19,ADAM,"Uh, yeah. Thanks, Denise."
4,19,SAM,"So, uh, when's the last time you saw John?"
4,19,ADAM,I don't even know. It's...a couple years.
4,19,SAM,Why did you decide to call him now?
4,19,ADAM,I didn't know who else to call. He's the only family I got.
4,19,ADAM,My mom's missing.
4,19,SAM,"Really? I'm sorry. Uh, for how long?"
4,19,DEAN,"It's tragic, really. But if you're John's kid, how come we've never heard of you?"
4,19,ADAM,"'Cause John and me didn't really know each other. Not until a few years ago, anyway."
4,19,SAM,What do you mean?
4,19,ADAM,My mom never talked about him. I knew some stuff.
4,19,DEAN,What kind of stuff?
4,19,ADAM,"My mom's a nurse, and Dad came into the ER, pretty torn up. Hunting accident or something. And I knew his name. John Winchester. That's about it. We're not exactly a nuclear family."
4,19,SAM,"Yeah, well, who is these days?"
4,19,DEAN,"So, when did you, uh, when did you finally meet him?"
4,19,ADAM,"When I was twelve. My mom had one of his old numbers, and—"
4,19,ADAM,"—and after I begged her—God, twenty-four-seven—she finally called him. God, when John heard he had a son, he raced to town. I mean, he dropped everything. He drove all night."
4,19,DENISE,There you go.
4,19,ADAM,Thanks.
4,19,DEAN,"Well, that's heartwarming."
4,19,ADAM,You mind?
4,19,DEAN,"Please, dig in."
4,19,ADAM,He would swing by once a year or so.
4,19,ADAM,"You know, called when he could. But still..."
4,19,ADAM,"He taught me poker and pool and even bought me my first beer when I was fifteen. And, uh...he showed me how to drive. Dad, he had this beautiful 'sixty-seven Impala—"
4,19,DEAN,"Oh, this is crap. You know what, you're lying."
4,19,ADAM,"No, I’m not."
4,19,DEAN,"Uh, yeah, you are."
4,19,ADAM,"I'm sorry, but who the hell are you to call me a liar?"
4,19,DEAN,"We're John Winchester’s sons, that's who."
4,19,ADAM,I've got brothers?
4,19,DEAN,"No, you don't have brothers. Look, man, I don't know if you're a hunter or what kind of game you're playing here."
4,19,ADAM,I have never been hunting in my life.
4,19,DEAN,"Whatever. I'm out of here. Come on, Sam."
4,19,ADAM,I can prove it.
4,19,DEAN,He took you to a baseball game?
4,19,ADAM,"Yeah, when I turned fourteen. Dad was around for a few of my birthdays."
4,19,SAM,"September twenty-ninth, two thousand four. One word. 'Minnesota.'"
4,19,DEAN,He took you to a freakin' baseball game?
4,19,ADAM,Yeah. Why? What'd Dad do with you on your birthday?
4,19,DEAN,Oh...
4,19,SAM,"Adam, you said you called Dad because your mom was missing."
4,19,ADAM,Yeah.
4,19,SAM,How long has she been gone?
4,19,ADAM,Three days.
4,19,DEAN,Who was the last person to see her?
4,19,ADAM,"Mr. Abbinanti, our neighbor. He saw her come home Tuesday night, but she never showed up to work on Wednesday."
4,19,SAM,Did you call the police?
4,19,ADAM,Mom's supervisor at the hospital did. And then I drove down here as fast as I could.
4,19,ADAM,I should have been here.
4,19,DEAN,"What'd the, uh, what'd the cops say?"
4,19,ADAM,"That they, uh, they searched the house. They didn't find anything."
4,19,ADAM,"She wouldn't leave without telling anybody. It's like she just dropped off the face of the earth, you know?"
4,19,DEAN,"The, uh, nightstand was knocked over. Was there anything else?"
4,19,ADAM,"Oh, not really. The sheriff said there's no sign of a break-in."
4,19,ADAM,"What, you think the cops missed something?"
4,19,DEAN,Maybe. Yeah. They don't have my eyes.
4,19,ADAM,You're a mechanic.
4,19,DEAN,Yeah. That's right.
4,19,ADAM,"Dean, what else can you tell me about Dad?"
4,19,DEAN,You knew him.
4,19,ADAM,Not as well as you.
4,19,DEAN,"Trust me, kid, you don't want to know."
4,19,DEAN,Give us a minute.
4,19,DEAN,You talk to the cops?
4,19,SAM,"Yeah. Like Adam said, no leads on his mom."
4,19,DEAN,Shocker there.
4,19,SAM,But I did find this.
4,19,SAM,"Um...here. In nineteen ninety, there were seventeen grave robberies in Windom."
4,19,DEAN,You think that's why Dad came through here?
4,19,SAM,I'd say so. Check it out.
4,19,DEAN,"All right, so he was hunting something. What?"
4,19,SAM,"No idea. Those were the pages he threw out of the journal. But last month, the corpse snatching started up again. Three bodies from the local cemetery."
4,19,DEAN,"So whatever he was after, he didn't kill it. It's back."
4,19,SAM,"And, what, it's stepped up its game to fresh meat? I mean, Kate's missing, and, uh—"
4,19,SAM,So is a local bartender—a guy named Joe Barton.
4,19,DEAN,"Hey, does your mom know Joe Barton?"
4,19,ADAM,"Uh, I don't think so. Why?"
4,19,ADAM,What is it?
4,19,DEAN,Watch out.
4,19,DEAN,Give me a hand with the mattress.
4,19,DEAN,Every time.
4,19,DEAN,Why didn't I pick paper?
4,19,ADAM,Who the hell are you?
4,19,SAM,"Adam, hey."
4,19,SAM,Take it easy.
4,19,ADAM,"No, don't tell me to take it easy, okay? My house is a crime scene, my mom's probably dead, and you two—well, you tell me to call the cops, but you got to bail before they show? So, who are you really?"
4,19,ADAM,"Cops didn't know where to look for my mom, Dean, but you did. And I heard you talking earlier—something about grave robberies."
4,19,ADAM,You're not mechanics. I just want to know what's going on.
4,19,ADAM,Please.
4,19,SAM,We're hunters.
4,19,DEAN,Sammy!
4,19,SAM,"He deserves to know, Dean."
4,19,ADAM,"What do you mean, 'hunters'?"
4,19,ADAM,"Okay, so...basically, you're saying that every movie monster, every nightmare that I’ve ever had, that's all real?"
4,19,SAM,We hunt them. So did Dad.
4,19,ADAM,Okay.
4,19,DEAN,"""Okay""? That's it?"
4,19,ADAM,What am I supposed to say?
4,19,DEAN,"That we're liars, that we're crazy. Nobody just says ""okay."""
4,19,ADAM,"Well, you're my brothers. You're telling me the truth, right?"
4,19,DEAN,Yeah.
4,19,ADAM,"Then I believe you. Now, what took my mom?"
4,19,SAM,"We're not sure. Something's in town stealing bodies, living and dead, but we don't know what."
4,19,DEAN,There's a long list of freaks that fit the bill.
4,19,ADAM,You think maybe she might still be alive?
4,19,ADAM,Oh. How can I help?
4,19,DEAN,You can't.
4,19,ADAM,"This thing killed my mom. If you're hunting it, I want in."
4,19,DEAN,No.
4,19,SAM,"Dean, look, maybe—"
4,19,DEAN,Maybe what?
4,19,SAM,He lost his mother. Maybe we can understand what that feels like.
4,19,DEAN,"Why do you think Dad never told us about this kid, Sam? Huh? Why do you think he ripped out the pages?"
4,19,SAM,Because—
4,19,DEAN,Because he was protecting him!
4,19,SAM,"Dad's dead, Dean."
4,19,DEAN,"That doesn't matter! He didn't want Adam to have our lives, okay? And we are gonna respect his wishes."
4,19,ADAM,Do I get a say in this?
4,19,DEAN,No!
4,19,SAM,No.
4,19,DEAN,Babysit the kid.
4,19,SAM,Where are you going?
4,19,DEAN,I'm going out!
4,19,ADAM,Is he always like that?
4,19,SAM,Welcome to the family.
4,19,SAM,Here.
4,19,SAM,I'm gonna teach you a few things.
4,19,ADAM,"Uh, Dean said—"
4,19,SAM,I know what Dean said.
4,19,SAM,And I know what it's like to want revenge.
4,19,DIRECTOR,This tomb was built in 1926. Four generations of the Millsap family were interred here.
4,19,DEAN,They don't build 'em like this anymore.
4,19,DIRECTOR,"Tell me, Agent Nugent, have you thought about where you might like to spend eternity?"
4,19,DEAN,All the damn time.
4,19,DEAN,"So, three bodies went missing. Any idea who did it?"
4,19,DIRECTOR,"Hooligans. Sick, deranged hooligans."
4,19,DEAN,This isn't blood. What is this?
4,19,DIRECTOR,"No, it's embalming fluid. Whoever committed this crime didn't just take the corpses. They opened them up."
4,19,BARTENDER,First beer's on the house for cops. Feds too.
4,19,DEAN,Am I that obvious?
4,19,BARTENDER,I know all the local badges.
4,19,BARTENDER,"So, what's the FBI doing in Windom?"
4,19,DEAN,Looking into the disappearance of Joe Barton.
4,19,DEAN,I assume you knew him?
4,19,BARTENDER,A little. I'm his wife. Lisa.
4,19,DEAN,"Well, Lisa, what can you tell me about his disappearance?"
4,19,LISA,Same thing I told the sheriff. He stayed late Friday before last to do inventory. Never came home.
4,19,DEAN,And the police?
4,19,LISA,"Nothing. Truth is, I was scared they stopped looking. But now you're here."
4,19,DEAN,Joe was a cop?
4,19,LISA,Deputy. For a little while. That was a looong time ago.
4,19,DEAN,"He didn't happen to work the, uh, the grave robbery case, back in 'ninety?"
4,19,LISA,He did. Yeah. Joe was the one who found those bodies. He got an award for that.
4,19,DEAN,That was an interesting case.
4,19,DEAN,He ever tell you how he did it?
4,19,LISA,"Most of the time, he said good, solid police work. But after a few beers, he'd admit he had a little help."
4,19,DEAN,From who?
4,19,LISA,A 'specialist'. That's all he'd say.
4,19,DEAN,Cops ever find the guy that stole the bodies?
4,19,LISA,No.
4,19,ADAM,Sam...how did Dad really die?
4,19,SAM,Demon.
4,19,ADAM,You hunted it down? Got revenge?
4,19,SAM,Dean killed it.
4,19,ADAM,So it's over for you.
4,19,SAM,It's never over.
4,19,ADAM,What the—
4,19,SAM,Shh.
4,19,SAM,Stay here.
4,19,SAM,It's in the vents. Go!
4,19,SAM,Where's your car?
4,19,ADAM,Over here.
4,19,SAM,"All right, keys."
4,19,ADAM,Here.
4,19,ADAM,Sam!
4,19,ADAM,"Dean, help!"
4,19,DEAN,I winged it. Did you see anything?
4,19,SAM,I didn't get a good look.
4,19,DEAN,What the hell is this thing?
4,19,ADAM,Why—who—should we go after it?
4,19,DEAN,"No, no. In that maze? That thing's long gone."
4,19,SAM,"All right, so, we don't know what it is, but we do know who it's going after. Joe Barton, Adam's mom—"
4,19,DEAN,"And Adam. It was under his truck, just waiting for him."
4,19,SAM,"It set a trap, and I walked right into it."
4,19,DEAN,"Doesn't matter. You're right—there's a pattern. Joe Barton was a cop. I'm pretty sure he helped out Dad. So we've got him, Dad's girl, and his son."
4,19,SAM,All the people Dad knew in town.
4,19,DEAN,At least we know why it's back.
4,19,ADAM,It wants revenge.
4,19,DEAN,Grab your stuff. We'll hit the road.
4,19,SAM,We shouldn't leave.
4,19,DEAN,"Yeah, let's stay here, where the kid's mom got ganked. Good one."
4,19,SAM,I'm serious.
4,19,DEAN,"No, Sam, we're gonna take the kid, we're gonna drop him off at Bobby's, and then you and me are gonna come back here and finish what Dad started."
4,19,SAM,"How? We got no leads, no witnesses. We do have what this thing wants."
4,19,DEAN,You want to use the kid as bait? That's why you want to stay here?
4,19,SAM,Maybe this thing will come back. We could train Adam—get him ready.
4,19,DEAN,"He could die, Sam."
4,19,SAM,"We could all die, Dean. Even if we do kill this thing, there are tons of other freaks that want revenge, on Dad, on us. What if they find the kid instead and he's not ready?"
4,19,ADAM,"I'll do it. Whatever it takes, I’ll do it. I want to do it."
4,19,ADAM,Whoa.
4,19,SAM,It's easy. Just feel the recoil and time the trigger pulls. Three taps.
4,19,ADAM,Yeah?
4,19,SAM,Go ahead.
4,19,ADAM,"Beginner's luck, right?"
4,19,SAM,"Nah, man. You're a natural. Good shooting."
4,19,ADAM,Thanks.
4,19,SAM,"So, then we lit it on fire."
4,19,ADAM,With a homemade flamethrower?
4,19,SAM,Yeah. They're easy to build. I'll show you.
4,19,ADAM,"That is some job you got, man."
4,19,SAM,"Being a hunter isn't a job, Adam. It's life. You're pre-med. You got a girlfriend, friends?"
4,19,SAM,"Not anymore you don't. If you're really gonna do this, you can't have those kinds of connections, ever. They're weaknesses. You'll just put those people in danger, get them killed."
4,19,SAM,"That's the price we pay. You cut 'em out, and you don't look back. There's only one thing you can count on. Family."
4,19,DEAN,Sam.
4,19,DEAN,Can I talk to you?
4,19,DEAN,What the hell was that?
4,19,SAM,What?
4,19,DEAN,"'Hunting is life. You can't have connections.' Dad gave you that exact same speech, remember? It was just before you ditched us for Stanford. You hated Dad for saying that stuff, and now you're quoting him?"
4,19,SAM,"Yeah, well, turns out Dad was right."
4,19,DEAN,Since when?
4,19,SAM,"Since always. Dean, when I look at Adam, you know what I see?"
4,19,DEAN,A normal kid.
4,19,SAM,"No. Meat. Because the demons and monsters out there, that's all he is. I hated Dad for a long time. I did. But now I think I understand. So we didn't have a dog and a white picket fence. So what? Dad did right by us. He taught us how to protect ourselves. Adam deserves the same."
4,19,DEAN,"Listen to yourself, man."
4,19,SAM,You think I’m wrong?
4,19,DEAN,"I think it's too late for us. This is our life. This is who we are, okay? And it's fine. I accept that. But with Adam, he's still got a chance, man. He can go to school. He could be a doctor."
4,19,SAM,What makes Adam so special?
4,19,DEAN,"What, are you jealous of the kid?"
4,19,SAM,Are you?
4,19,SAM,Dean...all this...it's not real. The dad Adam knew—he wasn't real. The things out there in the shadows—they are real. The world is coming to an end. That's real. Everything else is just part of the crap people tell themselves to get through the day.
4,19,DEAN,"Dad didn't have a choice with us, okay? But with Adam, he did. Adam doesn't have to be cursed."
4,19,SAM,He's a Winchester. He's already cursed.
4,19,DEAN,"No. No, whatever's hunting Adam, I’m gonna find it."
4,19,SAM,"You already looked everywhere, Dean."
4,19,DEAN,"Well, then I’ll look again."
4,19,DEAN,Home sweet home.
4,19,DEAN,Sloppy Joe.
4,19,DEAN,"Oh, son of a bitch!"
4,19,DEAN,Son of a bitch.
4,19,SAM,"All right. We've closed off every other way into the house. If this thing's coming, it's coming through here."
4,19,ADAM,You were saying?
4,19,KATE,Adam! Adam!
4,19,ADAM,Mom?
4,19,SAM,No.
4,19,ADAM,Mom!
4,19,SAM,Adam!
4,19,ADAM,Mom.
4,19,SAM,"Adam, wait!"
4,19,KATE,"It took me, but I got away."
4,19,ADAM,It's okay.
4,19,KATE,I got away.
4,19,SAM,"Adam, step away from her."
4,19,ADAM,"Sam, what the hell?!"
4,19,SAM,She's not your mother!
4,19,KATE,"Adam, who—what is going on?"
4,19,SAM,Get away from him!
4,19,'KATE',What is going on?
4,19,SAM,You listen to me.
4,19,ADAM,"It's really her, okay?"
4,19,SAM,There was too much blood. Your mother's dead. There was too much blood in the vents!
4,19,'KATE',Adam!
4,19,SAM,Shoot it!
4,19,'KATE',"He's crazy! Honey, it's me!"
4,19,SAM,Look—Adam!
4,19,'KATE',"Honey, it's me!"
4,19,SAM,"Look, that's not your mother!"
4,19,'KATE',"Baby, please!"
4,19,SAM,Shoot it! It's not human!
4,19,ADAM,I know.
4,19,SAM,Silver. No wonder none of the tests worked. You're not shapeshifters. You're ghouls.
4,19,'KATE',"You know, I find that term racist."
4,19,'KATE',Mmm. Fresh meat. So much better than what we're used to.
4,19,SAM,"I should have known. It was the fresh kills that threw me. Ghouls don't usually go after the living. See, you're just filthy scavengers, feeding off the dead—taking the form of the last corpse you choke down."
4,19,'ADAM',"And their thoughts. And their memories. Like Adam, for instance."
4,19,'KATE',"Well, we are what we eat."
4,19,SAM,You're monsters.
4,19,'ADAM',"You know, you use that word a lot, Sam."
4,19,'ADAM',But I don't think you know what it means.
4,19,'KATE',"His blood, it tastes different."
4,19,'ADAM',"Our father was a monster? Why? Because of what he ate? He never hurt anyone, Sam. Living, anyway."
4,19,'KATE',No. He was no monster. But the thing that killed him was. A monster named John Winchester.
4,19,DEAN,Holy crap.
4,19,'KATE',"Thanks to your daddy, my brother and I grew up on our own. At least we had each other."
4,19,'ADAM',Like you and your brother. Inseparable.
4,19,'KATE',"Actually, it was very hard to get you on your own."
4,19,'ADAM',"Like you said, Sam, the only thing you can count on is family."
4,19,'KATE',"And for twenty years, we lived like rats."
4,19,'ADAM',"Graveyard after graveyard, all that stinking flesh."
4,19,'KATE',"Then we thought, 'hey, why not move up to fresher game?'"
4,19,'ADAM',And we knew just where to start.
4,19,'ADAM',"Revenge—it's never over, is it, Sam?"
4,19,'KATE',"First, it was John's cop friend, and then his slut, and then his son."
4,19,'ADAM',"Then I called John, but the son of a bitch was already dead."
4,19,'KATE',So I guess you and Dean will have to do instead.
4,19,'ADAM',Dean won't interrupt us this time. We're gonna feed on you nice and slow—like we did with Adam.
4,19,'KATE',"Oh, and, by the way, he really was your brother."
4,19,'KATE',You should know that.
4,19,'ADAM',He was still alive when we took our first bites.
4,19,'KATE',And he was a screamer.
4,19,'ADAM',"Sam, the more you struggle, the faster you're gonna bleed out."
4,19,DEAN,Hey!
4,19,SAM,"Dean, they're ghouls!"
4,19,DEAN,Which means head-shot.
4,19,SAM,Dean!
4,19,DEAN,"Come on. Come on. Come on. Hang on. All right, here we go. Here we go. Hang on, buddy. All right."
4,19,SAM,Thank you.
4,19,DEAN,"That's what family's for, right? Keep pressure on that."
4,19,SAM,You sure we should do this?
4,19,DEAN,Ghouls didn't fake those pictures. They didn't fake Dad's journal.
4,19,DEAN,Adam was our brother. He died like a hunter. He deserves to go out like one.
4,19,SAM,"Maybe we can bring him back. Get a hold of Cas, call in a favor."
4,19,DEAN,"No, Adam's in a better place."
4,19,DEAN,"You know, I finally get why you and Dad butted heads so much. You two were practically the same person."
4,19,DEAN,"I mean, I worshipped the guy, you know? I dressed like him, I acted like him, I listen to the same music. But you were more like him than I will ever be. And I see that now."
4,19,SAM,I'll take that as a compliment.
4,19,DEAN,You take it any way you want.
4,22,DEAN,Who are you?
4,22,CASTIEL,Castiel. I'm an angel of the Lord.
4,22,CASTIEL,Because we have work for you.
4,22,SAM,I wish to God I could stop.
4,22,DEAN,"Yes, I swear."
4,22,ZACHARIAH,I'm Zachariah.
4,22,DEAN,"She's poison, Sam! Look what she did to you!"
4,22,CUT TO,
4,22,NUN,"Um, Father?"
4,22,RUBY,Sam? Your head in the game here?
4,22,RUBY,You okay?
4,22,SAM,I just said I was.
4,22,RUBY,"Look, I know hand-holding really isn’t my thing... but still, Dean was wrong, saying what he said to you."
4,22,SAM,"No, he was right to say it. I mean, I don't blame him after what I did."
4,22,RUBY,"Well, after we're done, you guys will patch things up. I mean, you always do."
4,22,SAM,You're talking like I've got an 'after'.
4,22,RUBY,Don't say that.
4,22,SAM,"I can feel it inside me, Ruby. I've changed... for good. And there's no going back now."
4,22,RUBY,Sam --
4,22,SAM,"Look, I know what I gotta do. It's okay, I'm just saying, Dean's better off as far away from me as possible. Anyways. Doesn't matter, let's just get this done with."
4,22,BOBBY,Dean? Dean! You listen to a word I said?
4,22,DEAN,"Yeah, I heard you. I'm not calling him."
4,22,BOBBY,"Don't make me get my gun, boy."
4,22,BOBBY,"I know you're pissed. And I'm not making apologies for what he's done, but he's your--"
4,22,DEAN,"Blood? He's my blood, is that what you were gonna say?"
4,22,BOBBY,He's your brother. And he's drowning.
4,22,DEAN,"Bobby, I tried to help him, I did. Look what happened."
4,22,BOBBY,So try again.
4,22,DEAN,It's too late.
4,22,BOBBY,There's no such thing.
4,22,BOBBY,You don't mean that.
4,22,DEAN,"Yes I do, Bobby. Sam's gone. He's gone. I'm not even sure if he's still my brother anymore. If he ever was."
4,22,BOBBY,"You stupid, stupid son of a bitch! Well, boo hoo, I am so sorry your feelings are hurt, princess! Are you under the impression that family's supposed to make you feel good?! Bake you an apple pie, maybe?  They're supposed to make you miserable! That's why they're family!"
4,22,DEAN,"I told him, ""you walk out that door, don't come back"" and he walked out anyway! That was his choice!"
4,22,BOBBY,"You sound like a whiny brat. No, you sound like your dad. Well, let me tell you something. Your dad was a coward."
4,22,DEAN,"My dad was a lot of things, Bobby, but a coward?"
4,22,BOBBY,"He'd rather push Sam away than reach out to him. Well, that don't strike me as brave. You are a better man than your daddy ever was. So you do both of us a favor. Don't be him."
4,22,CASTIEL,"Hello, Dean. It's almost time."
4,22,SAM,So. We need to talk.
4,22,ZACHARIAH,"Hello, Dean. You're looking fit."
4,22,DEAN,I'm not hungry.
4,22,ZACHARIAH,"No? How about Ginger from season 2 of ""Gilligan's Island""? You do have a thing for her, don't you?"
4,22,DEAN,Tempting. Weird.
4,22,ZACHARIAH,We'll throw in Mary Ann for free.
4,22,DEAN,"No, no. Let's... bail on the holodeck, okay? I want to know what the game plan is."
4,22,ZACHARIAH,"Let us worry about that. We want you... focused, relaxed."
4,22,DEAN,"Well, I'm about to be pissed and leaving, so start talking, Chuckles."
4,22,DEAN,Why?
4,22,ZACHARIAH,Lilith has to break it. She's the only one who can. Tomorrow night -- midnight.
4,22,DEAN,Where?
4,22,ZACHARIAH,We're working on it.
4,22,DEAN,"Well, work harder."
4,22,ZACHARIAH,we'll do our job. You just make sure you do yours.
4,22,ZACHARIAH,All in good time.
4,22,DEAN,Isn't now a good time?
4,22,ZACHARIAH,Have faith.
4,22,DEAN,"What, in you? Give me one good reason why I should."
4,22,SAM,I don't need one.
4,22,SAM,Where's Lilith?
4,22,DEMONIC NURSE,I'm not scared of you.
4,22,SAM,"Yeah, you are, actually. And with good reason."
4,22,DEMONIC NURSE,"Look... what's my upside? Okay, I tell you, you kill me. I don't tell you, you still kill me. I get away somehow, Lilith will definitely kill me. So where's my carrot?"
4,22,SAM,I think what you should be worrying about is what happens before you die.
4,22,SAM,You'll tell me where she is?
4,22,DEMONIC NURSE,Fine. Fine. Just... let me die.
4,22,SAM,A convent?
4,22,DEMONIC NURSE,Lilith... She's gonna break the final seal.
4,22,SAM,And what is the final seal?
4,22,SAM,Fine.
4,22,RUBY,Wait. You can't.
4,22,SAM,Why not?
4,22,DEMONIC NURSE,You promised.
4,22,RUBY,"Sorry, sister. You're a walking, talking can of whup-ass."
4,22,DEMONIC NURSE,You bitch!
4,22,RUBY,I know. Just can't trust anyone these days.
4,22,RUBY,That so?
4,22,DEMONIC NURSE,"Don't forget -- it's not just me you're bleeding. In fact, I think I'm gonna take a little... siesta in the subconscious -- hand over the wheel for a little bit."
4,22,SAM,What are you talking about?
4,22,DEMONIC NURSE,"Cindy McClellan, R.N., come on down!"
4,22,AZAZEL,"Father, look... I'm not exactly the praying type, but still... I made the sacrifice. I got you a bagful of nuns. So, uh... can you hear me? Can you whisper through the door?"
4,22,AZAZEL,"It's so good to hear your voice, Padre. I have been searching for you for so long. You have no idea. The others have lost faith. Dickless heathens. But not me."
4,22,LUCIFER,You've done well.
4,22,AZAZEL,"So, uh... how do I bust you out?"
4,22,LUCIFER,Lilith.
4,22,AZAZEL,"Lilith? Father, she's... trapped neck-deep in the pit. It won't be easy."
4,22,AZAZEL,"Yeah, okay. But what do I do?"
4,22,LUCIFER,You must find me a child. A very special child.
4,22,SAM,You got to be kidding me.
4,22,RUBY,What?
4,22,RUBY,Yeah?
4,22,SAM,Azazel.
4,22,RUBY,"Wow. So, Lilith, Yellow-Eyes -- all the A-listers are paying visits. Certainly gives the joint credibility."
4,22,SAM,As a place where the final seal goes down.
4,22,SAM,"Hey, maybe, um... look."
4,22,RUBY,What?
4,22,SAM,M-maybe we can find another demon.
4,22,RUBY,"Sam, no. That blubbery ""don't hurt me"" crap -- it's just an act. She's playing you."
4,22,SAM,I'm not so sure.
4,22,RUBY,"Even if she's not, there's still a hell-bitch snoozing in there. I mean, come on. It's not like you haven't done this before, right?"
4,22,CASTIEL,You asked to see me?
4,22,CASTIEL,Anything you wish.
4,22,DEAN,I need you to take me to see Sam.
4,22,CASTIEL,Why?
4,22,DEAN,There's something I got to talk to him about.
4,22,CASTIEL,What's that?
4,22,CASTIEL,I don't think that's wise.
4,22,DEAN,"Well, I didn't ask you for your opinion."
4,22,CASTIEL,Have you forgotten what happened the last time you met?
4,22,DEAN,"No. That's the whole point. Listen, I'm gonna do whatever you mooks want, okay? I just need to tie up this one thing. Five minutes -- that's all I need."
4,22,CASTIEL,No.
4,22,DEAN,"What do you mean, no? Are you saying that I'm trapped here?"
4,22,CASTIEL,You can go wherever you want.
4,22,DEAN,Super. I want to go see Sam.
4,22,CASTIEL,Except there.
4,22,DEAN,I want to take a walk.
4,22,CASTIEL,Fine. I'll go with you.
4,22,DEAN,Alone.
4,22,CASTIEL,No.
4,22,DEAN,You know what? Screw this noise. I'm out of here.
4,22,CASTIEL,Through what door?
4,22,DEAN,Damn it.
4,22,RUBY,What are you -- a 12-year-old girl? Just play it already.
4,22,SAM,Mind your own business.
4,22,CINDY,"Let me out! Let me out!
(thumping on the roof of the trunk)"
4,22,SAM,"God, I wish she would just shut up."
4,22,SAM,Is that supposed to make me feel better?
4,22,RUBY,"I know that you're having a tough time here, Sam, but we're in the final lap here. Now is not the time to grow a persqueeter."
4,22,SAM,Would you drop the friggin' attitude? I'm about to bleed and drink an innocent woman. While she watches.
4,22,RUBY,And save the world as a result.
4,22,SAM,I don't know. I-I just... I'm starting to think... maybe Dean was right.
4,22,RUBY,About what?
4,22,SAM,About everything.
4,22,RUBY,"We're gonna see this through, right, Sam? Sam?"
4,22,CINDY,"Let me out! Let me out!
(screaming and thumping on the roof of the trunk)"
4,22,DEAN,Son of a bitch.
4,22,DEAN,Let me out of here.
4,22,ZACHARIAH,Like I told you: too dangerous out there. Demons on the prowl.
4,22,DEAN,I've been getting my ass kicked all year. Now you're sweating my safety? You're lying. I want to see my brother.
4,22,ZACHARIAH,That's... ill-advised.
4,22,DEAN,"You know, I am so sick of your crap riddles and your smug, fat face. What the hell is going on, huh? Why can't I see Sam? And how am I gonna ice Lilith?"
4,22,DEAN,What?
4,22,ZACHARIAH,Lilith's going to break the final seal. Fait accompli at this point. Train's left the station.
4,22,ZACHARIAH,"Nope. Never did. The end is nigh. The apocalypse is coming, kiddo, to a theater near you."
4,22,DEAN,What was all that crap about saving seals?
4,22,ZACHARIAH,"Our grunts on the ground -- we couldn't just tell them the whole truth. We'd have a full-scale rebellion on our hands. I mean, think about it. Would we really let 65 seals get broken unless senior management wanted it that way?"
4,22,DEAN,But why?
4,22,DEAN,What happens to all the people during your little pissing contest?
4,22,DEAN,What about Sam? He won't go quietly. He'll stop Lilith.
4,22,DEAN,What does that mean? What are you gonna do to him?
4,22,DEAN,Which means?
4,22,DEAN,Tell me something. Where's God in all this?
4,22,ZACHARIAH,God? God has left the building.
4,22,LILITH,Howdy.
4,22,GUARD,"Lady, this is private property. You're not supposed to be here."
4,22,LIITH,But I'm here for mass. And so are you.
4,22,CASTIEL,"You can't reach him, Dean. You're outside your coverage zone."
4,22,DEAN,What are you gonna do to Sam?
4,22,CASTIEL,Nothing. He's gonna do it to himself.
4,22,CASTIEL,"We've been through much together, you and I. And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry it ended like this."
4,22,CASTIEL,Try to understand -- this is long foretold. This is your...
4,22,DEAN,"Destiny? Don't give me that ""holy"" crap. Destiny, God's plan... It's all a bunch of lies, you poor, stupid son of a bitch! It's just a way for your bosses to keep me and keep you in line! You know what's real? People, families -- that's real. And you're gonna watch them all burn?"
4,22,CASTIEL,"What is so worth saving? I see nothing but pain here. I see inside you. I see your guilt, your anger, confusion. In paradise, all is forgiven. You'll be at peace. Even with Sam."
4,22,CASTIEL,What would you have me do?
4,22,DEAN,Get me to Sam. We can stop this before it's too late.
4,22,CASTIEL,"I do that, we will all be hunted. We'll all be killed."
4,22,CASTIEL,Dean --
4,22,DEAN,We're done!
4,22,RUBY,"Sam, it's time. Are we doing this or not?"
4,22,SAM,Give me a minute to think.
4,22,RUBY,Sam --
4,22,SAM,"Give me a damn minute, Ruby!"
4,22,RUBY,Better think fast.
4,22,SAM,Do it.
4,22,ZACHARIAH,Castiel! Would you mind explaining just what the hell you're doing?
4,22,CASTIEL,He won't be gone long. We have to find Sam now.
4,22,DEAN,Where is he?
4,22,CASTIEL,"I don't know. But I know who does. We have to stop him, Dean, from killing Lilith."
4,22,DEAN,But Lilith's gonna break the final seal.
4,22,CASTIEL,"Lilith is the final seal. She dies, the end begins."
4,22,CHUCK,"Oh, yeah? Really? At the same time? Really? Wow. T-that sounds... moist."
4,22,CHUCK,"Uh, what are your rates?"
4,22,CHUCK,"Okay. Then, uh, I'll take 20 girls for the whole night."
4,22,WOMAN,I'm not sure you can afford that.
4,22,CHUCK,"Lady, sometimes you got to live like there's no tomorrow."
4,22,CHUCK,Wait. T-t-this isn't supposed to happen.
4,22,WOMAN,Sir?
4,22,LILITH,Don't be afraid. We're going to save the world.
4,22,DEAN,"St. Mary's? What is that, a convent?"
4,22,CHUCK,"Yeah, but you guys aren't supposed to be there. You're not in this story."
4,22,CHUCK,"Aw, man! Not again! No!"
4,22,SAM,I've been waiting for this... for a very long time.
4,22,LILITH,Then give me your best shot.
4,22,SAM,Dean?
4,22,SAM,What the hell?
4,22,RUBY,I can’t believe it.
4,22,SAM,"Ruby, what’s going on?"
4,22,RUBY,"You did it. I mean, it was a little touch-and-go there for a while, but... you did it."
4,22,SAM,What? What -- what did I do?
4,22,RUBY,You opened the door. And now he's free at last. He's free at last!
4,22,SAM,"Oh, my god."
4,22,RUBY,Guess again.
4,22,RUBY,"Don't hurt yourself, Sammy. It's useless. You shot your payload on the boss."
4,22,SAM,The blood... You poisoned me.
4,22,SAM,Why? W-why me?
4,22,RUBY,"Because... because it had to be you, Sammy. It always had to be you. You saved us. You set him free. And he's gonna be grateful. He's gonna repay you in ways that you can't even imagine."
4,22,RUBY,You're too late.
4,22,DEAN,I don't care.
4,22,DEAN,"Sammy, let's go."
4,22,CASTIEL,A pair of what?
4,22,CHUCK,"No, I mean, why are you helping Dean?"
4,22,CASTIEL,"It occurred to me, something he always says..."
4,22,CHUCK,Yeah? What's that?
4,22,CASTIEL,What the hell?
5,1,ANNA,—the sixty-six seals—
5,1,ANNA,Lucifer—
5,1,DEAN,You're possessing some poor bastard?
5,1,CASTIEL,This is a vessel.
5,1,DEAN,Chuck Shurley? We have a life.
5,1,CASTIEL,"Dean, let him go. This man is to be protected."
5,1,DEAN,Why?
5,1,CASTIEL,He's a prophet of the Lord.
5,1,CHUCK,Who are you?
5,1,ZACHARIAH,I'm Zachariah.
5,1,DEAN,And how'm I going to ice Lilith?
5,1,ZACHARIAH,You're not.
5,1,SAM,I'm sorry.
5,1,DEAN,"Sammy, let's go."
5,1,SAM,Dean—he's coming.
5,1,DEAN,Come on!
5,1,DEVIL,What the devil is your name?
5,1,YOSEMITE SAM,Sa-Sa-Sa-Sa-Yo-Yosemite Sam.
5,1,DEVIL,Yosemite Sam?
5,1,DEVIL,"Let's see. Ah, here it is. I could use a guy like you."
5,1,DEAN,What the hell?
5,1,SAM,I don't know.
5,1,DEAN,Ilchester? Weren't we just there?
5,1,PILOT,"So if you'd like to stretch your legs, now would be a good time to—"
5,1,PILOT,Holy crap!
5,1,DEAN,Change the station.
5,1,SAM,"Dean, look—"
5,1,DEAN,Don't say anything.
5,1,DEAN,"It's okay. We just got to keep our heads down and hash this out, all right?"
5,1,SAM,"Yeah, okay."
5,1,DEAN,"All right, well, first things first—How did we end up on Soul Plane?"
5,1,SAM,"Angels, maybe? I mean, you know, beaming us out of harm's way?"
5,1,DEAN,"Well, whatever. It's the least of our worries. We need to find Cas."
5,1,SAM,Geez! Ow!
5,1,CHUCK,Sam.
5,1,SAM,Yeah!
5,1,DEAN,"Hey, Chuck."
5,1,CHUCK,So...you're okay?
5,1,SAM,"Well, my head hurts."
5,1,CHUCK,"No, I mean—I mean, my—My last vision."
5,1,CHUCK,"You went, like, full-on Vader."
5,1,CHUCK,Your body temperature was one-fifty. Your heart rate was two hundred. Your eyes were black.
5,1,DEAN,Your eyes went black?
5,1,SAM,I didn't know.
5,1,DEAN,Where's Cas?
5,1,CHUCK,He's dead. Or gone. The archangel smote the crap out of him. I'm sorry.
5,1,DEAN,"You're sure? I mean, maybe he just vanished into the light or something."
5,1,CHUCK,"Oh, no. He, like, exploded."
5,1,CHUCK,Like a water balloon of chunky soup.
5,1,SAM,You got a—
5,1,CHUCK,Uh...right here?
5,1,SAM,"Uh, the..."
5,1,CHUCK,"Oh. Oh, god."
5,1,CHUCK,Is that a molar?
5,1,CHUCK,Do I have a molar in my hair? This has been a really stressful day.
5,1,DEAN,"Cas, you stupid bastard."
5,1,SAM,Stupid? He was trying to help us.
5,1,DEAN,"Yeah, exactly."
5,1,SAM,"So, what now?"
5,1,DEAN,I don't know.
5,1,CHUCK,"Oh, crap."
5,1,SAM,What?
5,1,CHUCK,I can feel them.
5,1,ZACHARIAH,Thought we'd find you here.
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"Playtime's over, Dean. Time to come with us."
5,1,DEAN,"You just keep your distance, asshat."
5,1,ZACHARIAH,You're upset.
5,1,DEAN,Yeah. A little. You sons of bitches jump-started judgment day!
5,1,ZACHARIAH,Maybe we let it happen. We didn't start anything.
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"Right, Sammy?"
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"You had a chance to stop your brother, and you couldn't. So let's not quibble over who started what. Let's just say it was—"
5,1,ZACHARIAH,—all our faults and move on. 'Cause like it or not—
5,1,ZACHARIAH,—it's Apocalypse Now.
5,1,ZACHARIAH,And we're back on the same team again.
5,1,DEAN,Is that so?
5,1,ZACHARIAH,You want to kill the devil.
5,1,ZACHARIAH,We want you to kill the devil. It's...synergy.
5,1,DEAN,And I'm just supposed to trust you?
5,1,DEAN,"Cram it with walnuts, ugly."
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"This isn't a game, son."
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"Lucifer is powerful in ways that defy description. We need to strike now, hard and fast—before he finds his vessel."
5,1,SAM,His vessel? Lucifer needs a meat suit?
5,1,ZACHARIAH,He is an angel. Them's the rules.
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"And when he touches down, we're talking Four Horsemen, red oceans, fiery skies—"
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"—the greatest hits. You can stop him, Dean, but you need our help."
5,1,DEAN,"You listen to me, you two-faced douche."
5,1,DEAN,"After what you did, I don't want jack squat from you!"
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"You listen to me, boy! You think you can rebel against us? As Lucifer did?"
5,1,ZACHARIAH,You're bleeding.
5,1,DEAN,"Oh, yeah—a little insurance policy in case you dicks showed up."
5,1,ZACHARIAH,No!
5,1,DEAN,"Learned that from my friend Cas, you son of a bitch."
5,1,CHUCK,This sucks ass.
5,1,DEAN,Hey.
5,1,SAM,Hey.
5,1,SAM,"Here. Hex bags. No way the angels will find us with those. Demons, either, for that matter."
5,1,DEAN,Where'd you get it?
5,1,SAM,I made it.
5,1,DEAN,How?
5,1,SAM,I...I learned it from Ruby.
5,1,DEAN,Speaking of. How you doing? Are you jonesing for another hit of bitch blood or what?
5,1,SAM,"I-it's weird. Uh, tell you the truth, I'm fine. No shakes, no fever. It's like whoever...put me on that plane cleaned me right up."
5,1,DEAN,Supernatural methadone.
5,1,SAM,"Yeah, I guess."
5,1,SAM,Dean—
5,1,DEAN,Sam.
5,1,DEAN,It's okay. You don't have to say anything.
5,1,SAM,"Well, that's good. Because what can I even say? ""I'm sorry""? ""I screwed up""? Doesn't really do it justice, you know? Look, there's nothing I can do or say that will ever make this right—"
5,1,DEAN,So why do you keep bringing it up?!
5,1,DEAN,"Look, all I'm saying is, why do we have to put this under a microscope? We made a mess. We clean it up. That's it."
5,1,DEAN,"All right, so, say this is just any other hunt. You know? What do we do first?"
5,1,SAM,"We'd, uh, figure out where the thing is."
5,1,DEAN,All right. So we just got to find...the devil.
5,1,NICK,"All right, keep it together. Keep it together, man."
5,1,SARAH,"It's you, Nick. You're special. You're chosen."
5,1,BECKY,"""And then Sam touched—"" No. ""—caressed Dean's clavicle. 'This is wrong,' said Dean. 'Then I don't want to be right,' replied Sam, in a husky voice."""
5,1,BECKY,Oh...my...god. You. You're...
5,1,CHUCK,"Carver Edlund, yeah. Hi, Becky."
5,1,BECKY,You got my letters. And my marzipan.
5,1,CHUCK,"Yeah, yeah. Um...yummy. But, uh—"
5,1,BECKY,"I am your number-one fan. You know, I'm samlicker81."
5,1,CHUCK,I'm sorry. You're—You're what?
5,1,BECKY,Webmistress at morethanbrothers dot net?
5,1,CHUCK,"Oh. Yeah. No, yeah. You're my...number-one fan."
5,1,CHUCK,That's why I contacted you. You're the only one who will believe me.
5,1,BECKY,Are you all right?
5,1,CHUCK,"No. I'm being watched. Okay, not, not now—at least, I don't think so. But I don't have much time. I need your help."
5,1,BECKY,You need my help?
5,1,CHUCK,That's right. I need you to get a message to Sam and Dean. Okay?
5,1,CHUCK,"Becky, it's all real."
5,1,BECKY,I knew it!
5,1,VOICE 1,"How would you then explain an earthquake, a hurricane, and multiple tornadoes, all at the same time, all around the globe?"
5,1,VOICE 2,Two words. Carbon emissions.
5,1,SAM,"You okay, lady?"
5,1,BECKY,Sam...is it really you?
5,1,BECKY,And you're so firm.
5,1,SAM,"Uh, do I know you?"
5,1,BECKY,No. But I know you. You're Sam Winchester. And you're—
5,1,BECKY,—not what I pictured. I'm Becky.
5,1,BECKY,I read all about you guys. And I've even written a few—
5,1,BECKY,"Anyway, Mr. Edlund told me where you were."
5,1,DEAN,Chuck?
5,1,BECKY,"He's got a message, but he's being watched. Angels. Nice change-up to the mythology, by the way. The demon stuff was getting kind of old."
5,1,SAM,"Right. Just, um...what's the message?"
5,1,BECKY,"He had a vision. ""The Michael sword is on earth. The angels lost it."""
5,1,DEAN,The Michael sword?
5,1,SAM,"Becky, does he know where it is?"
5,1,BECKY,"In a castle, on a hill made of forty-two dogs."
5,1,DEAN,Forty-two dogs?
5,1,SAM,Are...you sure you got that right?
5,1,BECKY,"It doesn't make sense, but that's what he said."
5,1,BECKY,I memorized every word.
5,1,BECKY,For you.
5,1,SAM,"Um, Becky, c—uh, can you...quit touching me?"
5,1,BECKY,No.
5,1,DEAN,"Hey, Bobby."
5,1,BOBBY,Good to see you boys all in one piece.
5,1,DEAN,"You weren't followed, were you?"
5,1,BOBBY,"You mean by angels, demons, or Sam's new superfan?"
5,1,SAM,You heard.
5,1,BOBBY,"I heard, Romeo. So...sword of Michael, huh?"
5,1,DEAN,You think we're talking about the actual sword from the actual archangel?
5,1,BOBBY,You better friggin' hope so.
5,1,BOBBY,That's Michael. Toughest son of a bitch they got.
5,1,DEAN,You kidding me? Tough? That guy looks like Cate Blanchett.
5,1,BOBBY,"Well, I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley, believe me. He commands the heavenly host. During the last big dust-up upstairs, he's the one who booted Lucifer's ass to the basement. Did it with that sword."
5,1,BOBBY,So if we can find it...
5,1,SAM,"We can kick the devil's ass all over again. All right. So, where do we start?"
5,1,BOBBY,Divvy up and start reading—try and make sense of Chuck's nonsense.
5,1,BOBBY,Kid? You all right?
5,1,SAM,"No, actually. Bobby, this is all my fault. I'm sorry."
5,1,DEAN,Sam...
5,1,SAM,Lilith did not break the final seal. Lilith was the final seal.
5,1,DEAN,"Sam, stop it."
5,1,SAM,"I killed her, and I set Lucifer free."
5,1,BOBBY,You what?
5,1,SAM,"You guys warned me about Ruby, the demon blood, but I didn't listen. I brought this on."
5,1,BOBBY,You're damn right you didn't listen. You were reckless and selfish and arrogant.
5,1,SAM,I'm sorry.
5,1,BOBBY,"Oh, yeah? You're sorry you started Armageddon? This kind of thing don't get forgiven, boy. If, by some miracle, we pull this off...I want you to lose my number. You understand me?"
5,1,SAM,There's an old church nearby. Maybe I'll go read some of the lore books there.
5,1,BOBBY,Yeah. You do that.
5,1,BOBBY,I never would have guessed that your daddy was right.
5,1,DEAN,About what?
5,1,BOBBY,About your brother.
5,1,BOBBY,What John said—you save Sam or kill him. Maybe...
5,1,DEAN,Maybe what?
5,1,BOBBY,Maybe we shouldn't have tried so hard to save him.
5,1,DEAN,Bobby.
5,1,BOBBY,"He ended the world, Dean. And you and I weren't strong enough to stop him proper. That's on us. I'm just saying, your dad was right."
5,1,DEAN,Dad.
5,1,DEAN,It's got to be in here somewhere.
5,1,BOBBY,What the hell are you talking about?
5,1,DEAN,Here.
5,1,DEAN,I don't believe it.
5,1,BOBBY,What the hell is it?
5,1,DEAN,It's a card for my dad's lockup in upstate New York. Read it.
5,1,BOBBY,"""Castle Storage. 42 Rover Hill."""
5,1,DEAN,Castle on a hill of forty-two dogs.
5,1,BOBBY,So you think your dad had the Michael sword all this time?
5,1,DEAN,I don't know. I'm not sure what else Chuck could have meant.
5,1,BOBBY,Yeah. Okay. It's good enough for me.
5,1,FEMALE DEMON,"I always knew you were a big, dumb, slow, dim pain in the ass, Dean. But I never dreamed you were so V.I.P."
5,1,FEMALE DEMON,"I mean, you're gonna ice the devil? You? If I'd have known that, I'd have ripped your pretty, pretty face off ages ago."
5,1,DEAN,Ruby.
5,1,FEMALE DEMON,Try again. Go back further.
5,1,DEAN,Meg?
5,1,MEG,"Hi. These are the days of miracle and wonder, Dean. Our father's among us. You know we're all dreaming again for the first time since we were human? It's heaven on earth. Or hell. We really owe your brother a fruit basket."
5,1,DEAN,"My god, you like the sound of your own voice."
5,1,MEG,"But you, on the other hand, you're the only bump in the road. So every demon—every single one—is just dying for a piece of you."
5,1,DEAN,Get in line.
5,1,MEG,"Oh, I'm in the front of the line, baby. Let's ride."
5,1,DEAN,"What is that, peanut butter?"
5,1,MEG,"You know, your surrogate daddy's still awake screaming in there. And I want him to know how it feels slicing the life out of you."
5,1,DEAN,Bobby!
5,1,MEG,Now!
5,1,DEAN,Bobby! No!
5,1,SAM,No!
5,1,MEG,"Heya, Sammy. You miss me? 'Cause I sure missed you."
5,1,SAM,Meg?
5,1,MEG,"It's not so easy without those super-special demon powers, huh, Sammy?"
5,1,NICK,No...
5,1,DEAN,Need some help here!
5,1,NURSE,What happened?
5,1,SAM,He was stabbed.
5,1,NURSE,Can we get a gurney?
5,1,DEAN,"Hang on, Bobby. Hang in there. You're gonna be okay."
5,1,NURSE,Just wait here.
5,1,SAM,We can't just leave him.
5,1,NURSE,Just don't move. I've got questions.
5,1,DEAN,"Sammy, we got to go."
5,1,SAM,"No. No way, Dean."
5,1,DEAN,"The demons heard where the sword is. We got to get to it before they do, if we're not too late already. Come on!"
5,1,ZACHARIAH,I see you told the demons where the sword is.
5,1,DEAN,"Oh, thank god. The angels are here."
5,1,ZACHARIAH,And to think...they could have grabbed it any time they wanted.
5,1,ZACHARIAH,It was right in front of them.
5,1,SAM,What do you mean?
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"We may have planted that particular piece of prophecy inside Chuck's skull, but it happened to be true. We did lose the Michael sword. We truly couldn't find it. Until now. You've just hand-delivered it to us."
5,1,DEAN,We don't have anything.
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"It's you, chucklehead. You're the Michael sword."
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"What, you thought you could actually kill Lucifer? You simpering wad of insecurity and self-loathing? No. You're just a human, Dean. And not much of one."
5,1,DEAN,"What do you mean, I'm the sword?"
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"You're Michael's weapon. Or, rather, his...receptacle."
5,1,DEAN,I'm a vessel?
5,1,DEAN,How? Why—why me?
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"Because you're chosen! It's a great honor, Dean."
5,1,DEAN,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, life as an angel condom. That's real fun. I think I'll pass, thanks."
5,1,ZACHARIAH,Joking. Always joking. Well...no more jokes.
5,1,ZACHARIAH,Bang.
5,1,SAM,God!
5,1,DEAN,You son of a bitch!
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"Keep mouthing off, I'll break more than his legs. I am completely and utterly through screwing around. The war has begun. We don't have our general. That's bad. Now, Michael is going to take his vessel and lead the final charge against the adversary. You understand me?"
5,1,DEAN,"How many humans die in the crossfire, huh? A million? Five, ten?"
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"Probably more. If Lucifer goes unchecked, you know how many die? All of them. He'll roast the planet alive."
5,1,DEAN,There's a reason you're telling me this instead of just nabbing me. You need my consent. Michael needs my say-so to ride around in my skin.
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"Unfortunately, yes."
5,1,DEAN,"Well, there's got to be another way."
5,1,ZACHARIAH,There is no other way. There must be a battle. Michael must defeat the serpent. It is written.
5,1,DEAN,"Yeah, maybe. But, on the other hand... Eat me. The answer's no."
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"Okay. How about this? Your friend Bobby—we know he's gravely injured. Say yes, and we'll heal him. Say no, he'll never walk again."
5,1,DEAN,No.
5,1,ZACHARIAH,Then how about we heal you from...stage-four stomach cancer?
5,1,DEAN,No.
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"Then let's get really creative. Uh, let's see how...Sam does without his lungs."
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"Are we having fun yet? You're going to say yes, Dean."
5,1,DEAN,Just kill us.
5,1,ZACHARIAH,"Kill you? Oh, no. I'm just getting started."
5,1,ZACHARIAH,How are you...
5,1,CASTIEL,"Alive? That's a good question. How did these two end up on that airplane? Another good question. 'Cause the angels didn't do it. I think we both know the answer, don't we?"
5,1,ZACHARIAH,No. That's not possible.
5,1,CASTIEL,"It scares you. Well, it should. Now, put these boys back together and go. I won't ask twice."
5,1,CASTIEL,You two need to be more careful.
5,1,DEAN,"Yeah, I'm starting to get that. Your frat brothers are bigger dicks than I thought."
5,1,CASTIEL,"I don't mean the angels. Lucifer is circling his vessel. And once he takes it, those hex bags won't be enough to protect you."
5,1,DEAN,What the hell was that?
5,1,CASTIEL,"An Enochian sigil. It'll hide you from every angel in creation, including Lucifer."
5,1,DEAN,"What, did you just brand us with it?"
5,1,CASTIEL,No. I carved it into your ribs.
5,1,SAM,"Hey, Cas, were you really dead?"
5,1,CASTIEL,Yes.
5,1,DEAN,Then how are you back?
5,1,SARAH,Nick.
5,1,SARAH,"Nick. You're dreaming, Nick. But it doesn't mean this isn't real."
5,1,NICK,Sarah?
5,1,SARAH,"I'm not your wife, Nick. I'm an angel."
5,1,NICK,An angel?
5,1,SARAH,My name is Lucifer.
5,1,NICK,"Sure. Naturally. Um... Could you do me a favor there, Satan, and remind me to quit drinking before I go to bed?"
5,1,LUCIFER,"I'm here because you're special, Nick. There's very, very few people like you."
5,1,NICK,Is that so?
5,1,LUCIFER,You're a vessel—a very powerful vessel.
5,1,NICK,"Meaning what, exactly?"
5,1,LUCIFER,"I need to take control of your mind and your body. To be honest, it'll probably be unpleasant for you. But it is necessary."
5,1,NICK,"Okay, look...if it's just the same to you, I think I'd like to wake up now."
5,1,LUCIFER,I told you—this is real. Don't be afraid. This is your choice.
5,1,LUCIFER,You need to invite me in.
5,1,NICK,"Even if this is real—which it's not, but assuming it was...why the hell would I do something like that?"
5,1,LUCIFER,"You people misunderstand me. You call me ""Satan"" and ""devil"", but... Do you know my crime? I loved God too much. And for that, he betrayed me—punished me. Just as he's punished you. After all, how could God stand idly by while that man broke into your home and butchered your family in their beds?"
5,1,LUCIFER,"There are only two rational answers, Nick—either he's sadistic, or he simply doesn't care. You're angry. You have every right to be angry. I am angry, too. That's why I want to find him—hold him accountable for his actions. Just because he created us doesn't mean he can toy with us, like playthings."
5,1,NICK,If I help you...can you bring back my family?
5,1,LUCIFER,"I'm sorry. I can't. But I can give you the next best thing. God did this to you, Nick. And I can give you justice. Peace."
5,1,NICK,How do I know you're telling the truth?
5,1,LUCIFER,"Because, contrary to popular belief, I don't lie. I don't need to. What I need...is you. Nick, I need you to say yes."
5,1,NICK,Then yes.
5,1,BOBBY,"""Unlikely to walk again""?! Why, you snot-nosed son of a bitch! Wait till I get out of this bed!"
5,1,BOBBY,"I'll use my game leg and kick your friggin' ass! Yeah, you better run!"
5,1,BOBBY,You believe that yahoo?
5,1,DEAN,Screw him. You'll be fine.
5,1,SAM,"So, let me ask the million-dollar question. What do we do now?"
5,1,BOBBY,"Well... We save as many as we can for as long as we can, I guess. It's bad. Whoever wins, heaven or hell, we're boned."
5,1,DEAN,What if we win?
5,1,DEAN,"I'm serious. I mean, screw the angels and the demons and their crap apocalypse. Hell, they want to fight a war, they can find their own planet. This one's ours, and I say they get the hell off it. We take 'em all on. We kill the devil. Hell, we even kill Michael if we have to. But we do it our own damn selves."
5,1,BOBBY,"And how are we supposed to do all this, genius?"
5,1,DEAN,"I got no idea. But what I do have is a GED and a give-'em-hell attitude, and I'll figure it out."
5,1,BOBBY,"You are nine kinds of crazy, boy."
5,1,DEAN,It's been said.
5,1,DEAN,"Listen, you stay on the mend. We'll see you in a bit."
5,1,BOBBY,Sam?
5,1,SAM,"Thanks, Bobby."
5,1,BOBBY,"You're welcome. I deserve a damn medal for this, but...you're welcome."
5,1,SAM,"You know, I was thinking, Dean—maybe we could go after the Colt."
5,1,DEAN,Why? What difference would that make?
5,1,SAM,"Well, we could use it on Lucifer. I mean, you just said back there—"
5,1,DEAN,I just said a bunch of crap for Bobby's benefit.
5,1,DEAN,"I mean, I'll fight. I'll fight till the last man, but let's at least be honest. I mean, we don't stand a snowball's chance, and you know that. I mean, hell, you of all people know that."
5,1,SAM,Dean...
5,1,SAM,Is there something you want to say to me?
5,1,DEAN,"I tried, Sammy. I mean, I really tried. But I just can't keep pretending that everything's all right. Because it's not. And it's never going to be. You chose a demon over your own brother—"
5,1,DEAN,—and look what happened.
5,1,SAM,I would give anything—anything—to take it all back.
5,1,DEAN,"I know you would. And I know how sorry you are. I do. But, man...you were the one that I depended on the most. And you let me down in ways that I can't even..."
5,1,DEAN,I'm just—I'm having a hard time forgiving and forgetting here. You know?
5,1,SAM,What can I do?
5,1,DEAN,Honestly? Nothing.
5,1,DEAN,I just don't...I don't think that we can ever be what we were. You know?
5,1,DEAN,I just don't think I can trust you.
5,2,SAM,What? What did I do?
5,2,RUBY,You opened the door.
5,2,DEAN,"You jonesing for another hit of bitch blood, or what?"
5,2,ZACHARIAH,You're the Michael sword.
5,2,DEAN,"What do you mean, I'm the sword?"
5,2,ZACHARIAH,You're Michael's weapon.
5,2,DEAN,I'm a vessel?
5,2,RUFUS,I'm what you've got to look forward to if you survive.
5,2,DEAN,Need some help here!
5,2,DEAN,What the hell was that?
5,2,CASTIEL,An Enochian sigil. It'll hide you from—
5,2,CASTIEL,"—every angel in creation, including Lucifer."
5,2,DEAN,"Ellen, this is my fault."
5,2,DEAN,But Jo did good out there.
5,2,JO,You're angry. I understand.
5,2,ELLEN,Angry? 'Angry' doesn't begin to touch it!
5,2,JO,"Is this about me hunting, or something else?"
5,2,DEAN,You chose a demon over your own brother. I just don't think I can trust you.
5,2,DEAN,It's been like three days now?
5,2,DEAN,We got to cheer him up. Maybe I'll give him a backrub.
5,2,SAM,Dean.
5,2,DEAN,"Well, what, then?"
5,2,SAM,Look...we might have to wrap our heads around the idea that Bobby might not just bounce back this time.
5,2,SAM,What's in the envelope?
5,2,DEAN,Went to radiology.
5,2,DEAN,Got some glamour shots.
5,2,DEAN,Let's just say the doctors are baffled.
5,2,SAM,Holy crap.
5,2,DEAN,"Yeah, well, Cas carved you one, too."
5,2,SAM,Hello? ...Castiel?
5,2,DEAN,Speak of the devil.
5,2,SAM,"Ah, St. Martin's Hospital. Why? What are you—Cas?"
5,2,DEAN,"Cell phone, Cas? Really? Since when do angels need to reach out and touch someone?"
5,2,CASTIEL,You're hidden from angels now—all angels. I won't be able to simply—
5,2,BOBBY,Enough foreplay.
5,2,BOBBY,Get over here and lay your damn hands on.
5,2,BOBBY,Get healing. Now.
5,2,CASTIEL,I can't.
5,2,BOBBY,Say again?
5,2,CASTIEL,I'm cut off from heaven and much of heaven's power. Certain things I can do. Certain things I can't.
5,2,BOBBY,You're telling me you lost your mojo just in time to get me stuck in this trap the rest of my life?
5,2,CASTIEL,I'm sorry.
5,2,BOBBY,Shove it up your ass.
5,2,DEAN,At least he's talking now.
5,2,BOBBY,I heard that.
5,2,CASTIEL,I don't have much time. We need to talk.
5,2,DEAN,Okay.
5,2,CASTIEL,Your plan to kill Lucifer.
5,2,DEAN,Yeah. You want to help?
5,2,CASTIEL,No. It's foolish. It can't be done.
5,2,DEAN,Oh. Thanks for the support.
5,2,CASTIEL,But I believe I have the solution. There is someone besides Michael strong enough to take on Lucifer. Strong enough to stop the apocalypse.
5,2,SAM,Who's that?
5,2,CASTIEL,The one who resurrected me and put you on that airplane. The one who began everything. God.
5,2,CASTIEL,I'm gonna find God.
5,2,DEAN,God?
5,2,CASTIEL,Yes.
5,2,DEAN,God.
5,2,CASTIEL,Yes! He isn't in heaven. He has to be somewhere.
5,2,DEAN,Try New Mexico. I hear he's on a tortilla.
5,2,CASTIEL,"No, he's not on any flatbread."
5,2,DEAN,"Listen, Chuckles, even if there is a God, he is either dead—and that's the generous theory—"
5,2,CASTIEL,"He is out there, Dean."
5,2,DEAN,—or he's up and kicking and doesn't give a rat's ass about any of us.
5,2,DEAN,"I mean, look around you, man. The world is in the toilet. We are literally—"
5,2,DEAN,"—at the end of days here, and he's off somewhere drinking booze out of a coconut. All right?"
5,2,CASTIEL,Enough.
5,2,CASTIEL,This is not a theological issue. It's strategic.
5,2,CASTIEL,"With God's help, we can win."
5,2,DEAN,"It's a pipe dream, Cas."
5,2,CASTIEL,"I killed two angels this week. My brothers. I'm hunted. I rebelled. And I did it, all of it, for you, and you failed. You and your brother destroyed the world—"
5,2,CASTIEL,"—and I lost everything, for nothing. So keep your opinions to yourself."
5,2,BOBBY,You didn't drop in just to tear us a new hole. What is it you want?
5,2,CASTIEL,I did come for something. An amulet.
5,2,BOBBY,An amulet? What kind?
5,2,CASTIEL,Very rare. Very powerful.
5,2,CASTIEL,It burns hot in God's presence. It'll help me find him.
5,2,SAM,A God EMF?
5,2,BOBBY,"Well, I don't know what you're talking about. I got nothing like that."
5,2,CASTIEL,I know. You don't.
5,2,DEAN,"What, this?"
5,2,CASTIEL,May I borrow it?
5,2,DEAN,No.
5,2,CASTIEL,Dean. Give it to me.
5,2,DEAN,"All right, I guess."
5,2,DEAN,Don't lose it.
5,2,DEAN,Great. Now I feel naked.
5,2,CASTIEL,I'll be in touch.
5,2,BOBBY,"When you find God, tell him to send legs!"
5,2,RUFUS,"Your belt, your belt!"
5,2,RUFUS,Hey. Hey! Hold this.
5,2,BOBBY,Hello?
5,2,RUFUS,"Bobby. Bobby, damn it, can you hear me?"
5,2,BOBBY,I can't hear you.
5,2,RUFUS,"Listen. I'm gonna need a little help here. Seems I'm up to my ass in demons. Whole damn town's infested. Hang on, hang on—"
5,2,BOBBY,Where are you?
5,2,RUFUS,"River Pass, Colorado."
5,2,BOBBY,Colora—Colorado?
5,2,RUFUS,Colorado!
5,2,BOBBY,"River Pass, Colorado?"
5,2,RUFUS,River Pass!
5,2,BOBBY,Rufus? You there? Ruf—Rufus?
5,2,RUFUS,"Bobby, it's—"
5,2,DEAN,This is the only road in or out.
5,2,SAM,No signal.
5,2,DEAN,Rufus was right. Demons got this place locked down.
5,2,SAM,Looks like we're hiking in.
5,2,DEAN,And the hits just keep on coming.
5,2,SAM,Ellen?
5,2,ELLEN,"Hello, boys."
5,2,DEAN,"Ellen, what the heck's going on here?"
5,2,DEAN,We're us.
5,2,ELLEN,Real glad to see you boys.
5,2,ELLEN,The can of whoopass I ought to open on you.
5,2,DEAN,Ow!
5,2,ELLEN,"You can't pick up a phone? What are you, allergic to giving me peace of mind? I got to find out that you're alive from Rufus?"
5,2,DEAN,"Sorry, Ellen."
5,2,ELLEN,"Yeah, you better be. You better put me on speed dial, kid."
5,2,DEAN,"Yes, ma'am."
5,2,DEAN,"What's going on, Ellen?"
5,2,ELLEN,More than I can handle alone.
5,2,SAM,How many demons are there?
5,2,ELLEN,"Pretty much the whole town, minus the dead people and these guys."
5,2,ELLEN,"So, this is it, right? End times?"
5,2,ELLEN,It's got to be.
5,2,SAM,Seems like it.
5,2,ELLEN,It's me.
5,2,ELLEN,This is Sam and Dean. They're hunters. Here to help.
5,2,AUSTIN,You guys hip to this whole demon thing?
5,2,DEAN,Yeah. Are you?
5,2,ROGER,My wife's eyes turned black. She came at me with a brick. Kind of makes you embrace the paranormal.
5,2,DEAN,"All right, catch us up."
5,2,ELLEN,"I doubt I know much more than you. Rufus called. Said he was in town investigating omens. All of a sudden, the whole town was possessed. Me and Jo were nearby—"
5,2,DEAN,You're hunting with Jo?
5,2,ELLEN,"Yeah, for a while now. We got here, and the place—well, the place was like you see it. Couldn't find Rufus, then me and Jo got separated. I was out looking when I found you."
5,2,DEAN,"Don't worry, we'll find her."
5,2,SAM,"Either way, these people cannot just sit here."
5,2,SAM,We got to get them out now.
5,2,ELLEN,"No, it's not that easy. I've been trying. We already made a run for it once."
5,2,SAM,What happened?
5,2,ELLEN,There used to be twenty of us.
5,2,ELLEN,You don't know what it's like out there. Demons are everywhere. We won't be able to cover everybody.
5,2,SAM,What if we get everyone guns?
5,2,DEAN,"What, are you gonna arm up baby bump over here?"
5,2,SAM,"More salt we can fire at once, more demons we can keep away."
5,2,DEAN,There's a sporting goods store we passed on Main on the way in. I bet they got guns.
5,2,SAM,All right. You stay. We'll go.
5,2,ELLEN,What about—
5,2,SAM,"If Jo and Rufus are out there, we'll bring them back."
5,2,DEAN,Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Hold on.
5,2,DEAN,Why don't I just go?
5,2,SAM,What? Alone?
5,2,DEAN,"Well, yeah. Somebody's got to stay here and start giving them Shotgun 101."
5,2,SAM,Yeah. Ellen.
5,2,DEAN,"No no no. It's gonna go a lot faster if you stay and help, okay?"
5,2,DEAN,I can handle it.
5,2,SAM,You don't want me going out there.
5,2,DEAN,I didn't say that.
5,2,SAM,Around demons.
5,2,DEAN,I didn't say that.
5,2,SAM,"Fine, then let's go."
5,2,SAM,I'll get the salt. You get the guns.
5,2,DEAN,We'll go together.
5,2,SAM,"Dean, it's right there. Can we at least do this like professionals?"
5,2,SAM,"Exorcisamus te, omnis immundus—"
5,2,DEAN,Sammy?
5,2,ROGER,"Okay, all right."
5,2,ELLEN,"Roger, hang on a second—"
5,2,ROGER,Sorry.
5,2,SAM,—then snap it in.
5,2,DEAN,You know your way around a gun at all?
5,2,DEAN,Hm. Where'd you serve?
5,2,AUSTIN,Fallujah. Two tours. Got back a little over a year ago. Takes one to know one. Where'd you serve?
5,2,DEAN,Hell.
5,2,AUSTIN,"No, seriously."
5,2,DEAN,Seriously. Hell.
5,2,DEAN,Hey.
5,2,SAM,Hey.
5,2,DEAN,What's wrong?
5,2,SAM,"It's just...at the store. Those demons were possessing teenagers. I mean, I had to slit some kid's throat."
5,2,DEAN,"Come on, Sam, you had to."
5,2,SAM,I know. I just...it used to be like...
5,2,SAM,I just wish I could save people like I used to.
5,2,DEAN,"What, you mean when you were all hopped up on demon blood?"
5,2,SAM,I didn't say that.
5,2,ELLEN,I'll be back.
5,2,DEAN,Where you going?
5,2,ELLEN,"I can't sit here on my ass. My daughter's out there somewhere. I'm not back in half an hour, go. Get these people out of here."
5,2,SAM,"No, wait. I'll go with you."
5,2,DEAN,"Whoa, hold on. Can I talk to you for a second?"
5,2,DEAN,You're gonna go out there again?
5,2,SAM,"Well, crap doesn't hit the fan with coffee breaks."
5,2,DEAN,I'll go.
5,2,SAM,"It's fine. Just stay here, get 'em ready. I'll cover Ellen."
5,2,DEAN,Why's it got to be you?
5,2,SAM,"Oh, that's right, I forgot. You think I'll take one look at a demon and suddenly fall off the wagon, as if, after everything, I haven't learned my lesson."
5,2,DEAN,"Well, have you?"
5,2,SAM,If you actually think I—
5,2,SAM,So where'd you see her last?
5,2,ELLEN,Up ahead. So what's up with you and Dean?
5,2,ELLEN,"It was hard not to notice, how different things are between you guys these days."
5,2,ELLEN,"Lot of bad road there, huh? What happened? Some girl come between you or something?"
5,2,SAM,"Just—stresses of the job. You know how it is. Kind of surprised, you and Jo hunting. Weren't you always saying she couldn't hack the life?"
5,2,ELLEN,She can't. But if she's gonna do it anyway—
5,2,SAM,You want to keep an eye on her.
5,2,SAM,Hey.
5,2,ELLEN,Is that a chimney going?
5,2,SAM,Looks like it. Come on.
5,2,ELLEN,Guess we found base camp.
5,2,SAM,Demons don't get cold. Makes you wonder what they're burning.
5,2,JO,"Don't move, you evil skank!"
5,2,ELLEN,"Don't you hurt her, don't you—"
5,2,JO,"Give me my mom back, you black-eyed bitch!"
5,2,SAM,Ellen! Run!
5,2,RUFUS,"Got you now, you bastard."
5,2,RUFUS,"Uh-uh. No way you're getting out of those. Did you up myself. You're stuck right where I want you, you evil son of a bitch."
5,2,SAM,"No, wait, wait, wait."
5,2,SAM,"Just, just wait."
5,2,RUFUS,"Exorcisamus te, exorcisamus te, omnis satanica—"
5,2,SAM,Stop!
5,2,RUFUS,—omnis immundum—
5,2,SAM,Please!
5,2,PASTOR,"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He layeth me down in green pastures, and he raiseth me up again. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil."
5,2,DEAN,Where's Sam?
5,2,PREGNANT WOMAN,They took him? Demons took him? Oh my god. What if they're in here? The demons?
5,2,PASTOR,Could they get in?
5,2,DEAN,No.
5,2,DEAN,Everybody sit tight. I got to—
5,2,DEAN,"Okay, we need to get a plan together. Tell me everything."
5,2,SAM,Please! Come on!
5,2,RUFUS,—omnis immundus—
5,2,SAM,Look! Something's not right! Do you see that?
5,2,SAM,Come on! Stop! Listen to me!
5,2,SAM,Listen!
5,2,JO,Why isn't it working?
5,2,RUFUS,I don't know.
5,2,SAM,"Look, listen to me, something's not right!"
5,2,RUFUS,But he's not as strong as he thinks he is.
5,2,SAM,You can see that. Please. Please. Just listen to me.
5,2,ELLEN,"Dean, one of them's in Jo. We got to get it out without hurting her."
5,2,ELLEN,It called me a bitch.
5,2,DEAN,"Bruise a little easy, don't you think?"
5,2,ELLEN,"No, that's not what I meant. It called me a black-eyed bitch."
5,2,ELLEN,"What kind of demons are these? Holy water and salt roll right off. My daughter may be an idiot, but she's not stupid. She wears an anti-possession charm. It's all kind of weird, right?"
5,2,DEAN,The whole thing's off.
5,2,ELLEN,What's your instinct?
5,2,DEAN,My instinct? My instinct is to call Bobby and ask for help. Or Sam.
5,2,ELLEN,"Well, tough. All you got's me, and all I got's you. So let's figure it out."
5,2,DEAN,All right.
5,2,DEAN,Do you know why Rufus came to town? Was there a specific omen?
5,2,ELLEN,He said something about water. That's all I know.
5,2,DEAN,"Padré, you know what she's talking about—the water?"
5,2,PASTOR,The river. Ran polluted all of a sudden.
5,2,DEAN,When?
5,2,AUSTIN,Last Wednesday. And the demon thing started up the next day.
5,2,DEAN,Anything else? Anything.
5,2,AUSTIN,"Maybe, but it's pretty random."
5,2,DEAN,Good. Random's good.
5,2,AUSTIN,Shooting star—does that count?
5,2,AUSTIN,Real big. Same night. Wednesday.
5,2,DEAN,That definitely counts.
5,2,AUSTIN,"So, uh, you think that all this comes from outer space?"
5,2,DEAN,"""And there fell a great star from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell upon the river, and the name of the star was Wormwood. And many men died."""
5,2,PASTOR,Revelation eight ten. Are you saying that this is about the apocalypse?
5,2,DEAN,"You could say. And these specific omens, they're prelude to what?"
5,2,PASTOR,The Four Horsemen.
5,2,DEAN,And which one rides the red horse?
5,2,PASTOR,War.
5,2,DEAN,That cherry Mustang parked on Main.
5,2,PASTOR,You can't think that a car—
5,2,DEAN,"It's the way I'd roll. I mean, think about it. It all makes sense. If War is a dude and he's here, maybe he's messing with our heads."
5,2,ELLEN,Turning us on each other.
5,2,DEAN,"You said Jo called you a black-eyed bitch. They think we're demons, we think they're demons. What if there are no demons at all and we're all just killing each other?"
5,2,PASTOR,"Wait, just back up. It's the apocalypse?"
5,2,DEAN,"Sorry, Padré."
5,2,SAM,Who the hell are you?
5,2,SAM,What are you?
5,2,'ROGER',You caught me. Popped in to watch. I can hustle like that.
5,2,SAM,"So, the Roger everyone around here knows, the real Roger?"
5,2,'ROGER',Buried in a ditch.
5,2,SAM,So who are you?
5,2,'ROGER',Here's a hint. I was in Germany. Then in Germany. Then in the Middle East. I was in Darfur when my beeper went off. I'm waiting to hook up with my siblings. I've got three. We're going to have so much fun together.
5,2,SAM,"I know who you are. There aren't any demons in town, are there?"
5,2,WAR,"Nope. Just frightened people ripping each other's throats out. I really haven't had to do too much. Take out a bridge here, lay in a little hallucination there, sit back, pop some corn, watch the show. Frankly, you're really vicious little animals, Sam."
5,2,SAM,No. You're doing this.
5,2,WAR,"Please. Last week, this was Mayberry. Now these people are stabbing each other's children."
5,2,SAM,'Cause you made them see demons!
5,2,WAR,"Honestly, people don't need a reason to kill each other. I mean, you seen the Irish? They're all Irish."
5,2,WAR,You think I'm a monster. I'm jello shots at a party. I just remove inhibitions.
5,2,SAM,I'm gonna kill you myself.
5,2,WAR,"Oh, that's adorable, considering you're my poster boy."
5,2,SAM,What's that supposed to mean?
5,2,WAR,"You can't stop thinking about it, ever since you saw it dripping off the blade of that knife."
5,2,SAM,You're wrong.
5,2,WAR,"Save your protests for your brother. I can see inside your head. And man, it is one-track city in there. Blood, blood, blood. Lust for power. Same as always. You want to be strong again. But not just strong. Stronger than everybody. Good intentions—quick slide to hell, buddy boy. You feel bad now? Wait till you're thigh deep in warm corpses. Because, my friend, I'm just getting started."
5,2,WAR,Showtime for the meatsuits. Watch this.
5,2,WAR,He did it!
5,2,SAM,No!
5,2,WAR,He said they're coming! He said they're coming to get us!
5,2,SAM,"No, stop! Jo, Rufus, he's lying! No!"
5,2,RUFUS,You shut your mouth!
5,2,SAM,Please! Jo! He's lying!
5,2,AUSTIN,So now you're saying that there are no demons and war is a guy.
5,2,DEAN,You believed crazy before.
5,2,WAR,Open up! It's Roger!
5,2,WAR,"I saw them, the demons. They know we're trying to leave. They said they're gonna pick us off one by one."
5,2,DEAN,Wait wait wait. What?
5,2,AUSTIN,I thought you said there were no demons.
5,2,DEAN,There's not. Where did you go?
5,2,WAR,I thought someone should go out and see what's going on!
5,2,DEAN,Where did you see the demons and what did they say exactly?
5,2,AUSTIN,"We just sit here, we're going to be dead."
5,2,DEAN,"No, we're not!"
5,2,WAR,They're gonna kill us unless we kill them first.
5,2,DEAN,Hold on. Hold on.
5,2,AUSTIN,"No, man, we got people to protect. All right, the able-bodied go hunt some demons."
5,2,DEAN,Whoa whoa whoa. Slow your roll. This is not a demon thing.
5,2,WAR,Look at their eyes! They're demons!
5,2,DEAN,"Go, go!"
5,2,DEAN,Move!
5,2,WAR,Those are real.
5,2,AUSTIN,"Those two could have been demons the entire time. All this salt and holy water talk—as far as I'm concerned, it's all crap."
5,2,WAR,Are you sure?
5,2,AUSTIN,It's them or us.
5,2,WAR,I think I saw some knives in the kitchen.
5,2,AUSTIN,Great. Go.
5,2,JO,"Hey, Rufus."
5,2,RUFUS,Yeah.
5,2,JO,Pipe bombs won't kill a demon.
5,2,RUFUS,"Right. But in my experience, demons come at you slower if they're in a body with no limbs."
5,2,JO,One of them is in my mother.
5,2,RUFUS,"Jo, listen to me. You know I'm gonna do everything I can. Your mom's gonna be okay."
5,2,JO,Unless she comes through that window.
5,2,AUSTIN,"All right, let's move."
5,2,JO,Rufus!
5,2,ELLEN,"Now you listen up, Joanna Beth Harvelle."
5,2,DEAN,"Listen to me. I'm not a demon. Think, Rufus. All those omens."
5,2,RUFUS,You go to hell.
5,2,DEAN,"Rufus! The polluted water, the shooting star, the red Mustang—it's War. I'm telling you, it's War."
5,2,RUFUS,You're damn right it is.
5,2,DEAN,The Horseman!
5,2,RUFUS,Horseman?
5,2,DEAN,Yes. He's turning us against each other. You're hallucinating.
5,2,RUFUS,The Horseman. War.
5,2,DEAN,Yes.
5,2,RUFUS,"Did you figure this out all by yourself, genius?"
5,2,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa!"
5,2,ELLEN,We all on the same page?
5,2,RUFUS,Good.
5,2,DEAN,"Hi, Jo."
5,2,JO,Hey.
5,2,DEAN,"Okay, we got to find War before everybody in this town kills each—"
5,2,DEAN,Damn it! Where's Sam?
5,2,RUFUS,Upstairs.
5,2,ELLEN,Take this.
5,2,AUSTIN,"All right, you three go around back. Take the alley."
5,2,SAM,Dean. It's not demons.
5,2,DEAN,I just can't figure out how he's doing it.
5,2,SAM,The ring.
5,2,DEAN,The ring. The ring—that's right. He turned it right before he made everybody hallucinate and go hellbitch.
5,2,SAM,Right.
5,2,DEAN,We got to move. Come on.
5,2,RUFUS,"People, cease fire!"
5,2,RUFUS,Stop shooting! Stop!
5,2,RUFUS,I'm getting too old for this.
5,2,YOUNG WOMAN,Father!
5,2,ELLEN,"I'm not what you think, honey. Come on, keep this right here."
5,2,RUFUS,'Stop firing' usually means 'stop firing'.
5,2,WAR,"Whoa. Okay. That's a sweet little knife. But come on. You can't kill war, kiddos."
5,2,DEAN,"Oh, we know."
5,2,DEAN,"So, pit stop at Mount Doom?"
5,2,SAM,Dean—
5,2,DEAN,"Sam, let's not."
5,2,SAM,"No, listen. This is important. I know you don't trust me."
5,2,SAM,"Just, now I realize something. I don't trust me either."
5,2,SAM,"From the minute I saw that blood, only thought in my head...and I tell myself it's for the right reasons, my intentions are good, and it, it feels true, you know? But I think, underneath...I just miss the feeling. I know how messed up that sounds, which means I know how messed up I am. Thing is, the problem's not the demon blood, not really. I mean, I, what I did, I can't blame the blood or Ruby or...anything. The problem's me. How far I'll go. There's something in me that...scares the hell out of me, Dean. In the last couple of days, I caught another glimpse..."
5,2,DEAN,So what are you saying?
5,2,SAM,"I'm in no shape to be hunting. I need to step back, 'cause I'm dangerous. Maybe it's best we just...go our separate ways."
5,2,DEAN,"Well, I think you're right."
5,2,SAM,I was expecting a fight.
5,2,DEAN,"The truth is I spend more time worrying about you than about doing the job right. And I just, I can't afford that, you know? Not now."
5,2,SAM,"I'm sorry, Dean."
5,2,DEAN,"I know you are, Sam."
5,2,DEAN,"Hey, do you, uh, wanna take the Impala?"
5,2,SAM,It's okay.
5,2,SAM,"Take care of yourself, Dean."
5,2,DEAN,"Yeah, you too, Sammy."
5,3,SAM,"As if after everything, I haven't learned my lesson."
5,3,DEAN,"Well, have you?"
5,3,SAM,"This is my girlfriend, Jessica."
5,3,SAM,No! Jess!
5,3,DEAN,I'm a vessel?
5,3,DEAN,The answer's no.
5,3,CHUCK,The archangel smote the crap out of him.
5,3,ZACHARIAH,How are you—
5,3,CASTIEL,Alive? That's a good question.
5,3,SAM,I just wish I could save people. Like I used to.
5,3,DEAN,Like when you were all hopped up on demon blood?
5,3,CASTIEL,Your plan—
5,3,CASTIEL,I'm gonna find God.
5,3,DEAN,Try New Mexico. I hear he's on a tortilla.
5,3,CASTIEL,"I killed two angels this week. I rebelled, and I did it, all of it, for you, and you failed."
5,3,SAM,I'm in no shape to be hunting.
5,3,JESS,"Hey, baby."
5,3,JESS,I missed you.
5,3,SAM,Jessica. I'm dreaming.
5,3,JESS,Or you're not. What's the difference? I'm here.
5,3,SAM,I miss you so much.
5,3,JESS,I know.
5,3,JESS,"I miss you too. What are you doing, Sam?"
5,3,SAM,What do you mean?
5,3,JESS,Running away. Haven't we been down this road before?
5,3,SAM,No. It's different now.
5,3,JESS,Really?
5,3,SAM,Last time I wanted to be normal. This time I know I'm a freak.
5,3,JESS,Which is all a big ball of semantics. You know that.
5,3,SAM,No.
5,3,JESS,"Even at Stanford you knew. You knew there was something dark inside of you. Deep down, maybe, but you knew. Maybe that's what got me killed."
5,3,SAM,No.
5,3,JESS,I was dead from the moment we said hello.
5,3,SAM,No.
5,3,JESS,Don't you get it? You can't run from yourself. Why are you running now?
5,3,SAM,"Why are you here, Jess?"
5,3,JESS,Would you believe I'm actually trying to protect you?
5,3,SAM,From what?
5,3,JESS,You. Sooner or later the past is going to catch up to you like it always does. You know what happens then?
5,3,JESS,"People die. Baby, the people closest to you die."
5,3,SAM,Don't worry because I won't make that mistake again.
5,3,JESS,"Same song, different verse. Things are never gonna change with you. Ever."
5,3,SAM,Thanks.
5,3,DRIVER,You're welcome.
5,3,DEAN,"Hi, Detective Bill Buckner."
5,3,DOCTOR,"Yes. How can I help you, Detective?"
5,3,DEAN,"I'm here about those patients, the exsanguinated ones."
5,3,DEAN,"Eat it, Twilight."
5,3,DEAN,God.
5,3,DEAN,Don't do that.
5,3,CASTIEL,"Hello, Dean."
5,3,DEAN,"Cas, we've talked about this. Personal space?"
5,3,CASTIEL,My apologies.
5,3,DEAN,How'd you find me? I thought I was flying below the angel radar.
5,3,CASTIEL,You are. Bobby told me where you were.
5,3,CASTIEL,Where's Sam?
5,3,DEAN,Me and Sam are taking separate vacations for a while. So.
5,3,DEAN,"You find God yet? More importantly, can I have my damn necklace back, please?"
5,3,CASTIEL,"No, I haven't found him. That's why I'm here. I need your help."
5,3,DEAN,With what? God hunt? Not interested.
5,3,CASTIEL,It's not God. It's someone else.
5,3,DEAN,Who?
5,3,CASTIEL,Archangel. The one who killed me.
5,3,DEAN,'Scuse me?
5,3,CASTIEL,His name is Raphael.
5,3,DEAN,You were wasted by a teenage mutant ninja angel?
5,3,CASTIEL,I've heard whispers that he's walking the earth. This is a rare opportunity.
5,3,DEAN,For what? Revenge?
5,3,CASTIEL,Information.
5,3,DEAN,"So, what, you think you can find this dude and he's just gonna spill God's address?"
5,3,CASTIEL,"Yes, because we are gonna trap him and interrogate him."
5,3,DEAN,You're serious about this.
5,3,DEAN,"So, what, I'm Thelma and you're Louise and we're just going to hold hands and sail off this cliff together?"
5,3,DEAN,Give me one good reason why I should do this.
5,3,CASTIEL,Because you're Michael's vessel and no angel will dare harm you.
5,3,DEAN,"Oh, so I'm your bullet shield."
5,3,CASTIEL,I need your help because you are the only one who'll help me. Please.
5,3,DEAN,"All right, fine. Where is he?"
5,3,CASTIEL,Maine. Let's go.
5,3,DEAN,Whoa.
5,3,CASTIEL,What?
5,3,DEAN,Last time you zapped me someplace I didn't poop for a week. We're driving.
5,3,LINDSEY,"Hey Keith, you play?"
5,3,SAM,That depends. What are we playing for?
5,3,LINDSEY,World peace.
5,3,SAM,"Oh, is that all?"
5,3,LINDSEY,Can I ask you something?
5,3,SAM,Shoot.
5,3,LINDSEY,You finished that crossword puzzle in the kitchen?
5,3,SAM,"Uh, I guess. Why?"
5,3,SAM,Was it?
5,3,LINDSEY,"Uh-huh. You blow into town last week, you don't talk to anybody, you're obviously highly educated. You're like this..."
5,3,SAM,Riddle wrapped inside an enigma wrapped inside a taco?
5,3,LINDSEY,"Here's what we play for. When I win, you buy me dinner and tell me your life story."
5,3,SAM,Sounds fair.
5,3,LINDSEY,Very mysterioso.
5,3,LINDSEY,I like it.
5,3,REPORTER,"—the town of Tully? tonight, John. Locals say that what started as a torrential hailstorm late this afternoon suddenly turned to massive lightning strikes that triggered the fires now consuming more than twenty acres here along the Route 17 corridor. County officials are advising all Tully residents to prepare for what could become mandatory evacuations."
5,3,BARTENDER,Damn. Is it me or does it seem like it's the end of the world?
5,3,DEAN,And we're here why?
5,3,CASTIEL,A deputy sheriff laid eyes on the archangel.
5,3,DEAN,"And he still has eyes? All right, what's the plan?"
5,3,CASTIEL,"We'll...tell the officer that he witnessed an angel of the Lord, and the officer will tell us where the angel is."
5,3,DEAN,Seriously? You're going to walk in there and tell him the truth?
5,3,CASTIEL,Why not?
5,3,DEAN,Because we're humans.
5,3,DEAN,"And when humans want something really, really bad, we lie."
5,3,CASTIEL,Why?
5,3,DEAN,Because that's how you become President.
5,3,DEAN,Deputy Framingham?
5,3,DEAN,"Hi. Alonzo Mosely, FBI. This is my partner, Eddie Moscone."
5,3,DEAN,Also FBI.
5,3,DEAN,"He's, uh, he's new. Mind if we ask you a few questions?"
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,"Yeah, sure. Talk here, though."
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,Hearing's all blown to hell in this one.
5,3,DEAN,That happen recently?
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,"Yeah. Gas station. Why you're here, isn't it?"
5,3,DEAN,"Yes, it is."
5,3,DEAN,"You mind just, uh, running us through what happened?"
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,A call came in. Disturbance out at the Pump and Go on Route 4.
5,3,DEAN,What kind of disturbance?
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,Would not have believed my eyes if I hadn't seen it myself. We're talking a riot. Full scale.
5,3,DEAN,How many?
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,"Thirty, forty, in all-out kill-or-be-killed combat?"
5,3,DEAN,Any idea what set them off?
5,3,CASTIEL,"It's angels and demons, probably."
5,3,CASTIEL,They're skirmishing all over the globe.
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,Come again?
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,What did he say?
5,3,DEAN,Nothing. Nothing.
5,3,CASTIEL,Demons. Demons.
5,3,DEAN,"Demons, you know, drink, adultery. We all have our demons, Walt."
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,I guess.
5,3,DEAN,Anyway.
5,3,DEAN,What happened next?
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,"Freaking explosion, that's what. They said it was one of those underground gas tanks, but, uh, I don't think so."
5,3,DEAN,Why not?
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,"Wasn't your usual fireball. It was, um—"
5,3,CASTIEL,Pure white.
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,"Yeah. Gas station was leveled. Everyone was...it was just horrible. And I see this one guy, kneeling, real focused-like, not a damn scratch on him."
5,3,DEAN,You know him?
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,Donnie Finneman. Mechanic there.
5,3,DEAN,"Let me guess, he just, uh, vanished into thin air?"
5,3,FRAMINGHAM,"Uh, no, Kolchak. He's down at Saint Pete's."
5,3,CASTIEL,Saint Pete's.
5,3,DEAN,Thank you.
5,3,DEAN,I take it that's not Raphael anymore.
5,3,CASTIEL,Just an empty vessel.
5,3,DEAN,So is this what I'm looking at if Michael jumps in my bones?
5,3,CASTIEL,"No, not at all. Michael is much more powerful. It'll be far worse for you."
5,3,BOBBY,Sam?
5,3,SAM,Hey Bobby. How you doing?
5,3,BOBBY,"Well I ain't running any marathons, but I'll live."
5,3,BOBBY,Where are you?
5,3,SAM,"Uh, Garber, Oklahoma. I found a town up the road showing some Revelation omens."
5,3,BOBBY,What omens?
5,3,SAM,"All right, listen to this. 'And upon his rising there shall be hail and fire mixed with blood.'"
5,3,BOBBY,Well ain't that delightful.
5,3,SAM,Yeah. But we already got hailstorms and fire so I'm guessing blood can't be too far behind.
5,3,BOBBY,Okay.
5,3,SAM,What?
5,3,BOBBY,There a reason you're calling?
5,3,SAM,Dean didn't tell you?
5,3,BOBBY,He told me.
5,3,SAM,Yeah. So I just thought you might want to find out who's in the area and put a man on this.
5,3,BOBBY,"Okay, let me see if I can think of the best hunter who might be in the immediate vicinity—oh, that'd be you."
5,3,SAM,"I can't, Bobby, I'm sitting this one out."
5,3,BOBBY,Sam—
5,3,SAM,I gotta go. I'm so sorry.
5,3,BOBBY,"Hold on, Sam—"
5,3,DEAN,Where've you been?
5,3,CASTIEL,Jerusalem.
5,3,DEAN,"Oh, how was it?"
5,3,CASTIEL,Arid.
5,3,DEAN,What's that?
5,3,CASTIEL,It's oil. It's very special. Very rare.
5,3,DEAN,"Okay, so we trap Raphael with a nice vinaigrette?"
5,3,CASTIEL,No.
5,3,DEAN,"So this ritual of yours, when does it got to go down?"
5,3,CASTIEL,Sunrise.
5,3,DEAN,Tell me something. You keep saying we're gonna trap this guy. Isn't that kinda like trapping a hurricane with a butterfly net?
5,3,CASTIEL,"No, it's harder."
5,3,DEAN,Do we have any chance of surviving this?
5,3,CASTIEL,You do.
5,3,DEAN,So odds are you're a dead man tomorrow.
5,3,CASTIEL,Yes.
5,3,DEAN,Well. Last night on earth. What are your plans?
5,3,CASTIEL,I just thought I'd sit here quietly.
5,3,DEAN,"Come on, anything? Booze, women?"
5,3,DEAN,"You have been with women before. Right? Or an angel, at least?"
5,3,DEAN,You mean to tell me you've never been up there doing a little cloud-seeding?
5,3,CASTIEL,"Look, I've never had occasion, okay?"
5,3,DEAN,All right.
5,3,MAN,"Hey, Sam."
5,3,MAN,Sam.
5,3,LINDSEY,Sam? What happened to Keith?
5,3,SAM,"Wait, what?"
5,3,LINDSEY,He called you Sam.
5,3,SAM,Yeah. Uh. Sam's my middle name.
5,3,LINDSEY,"Keith Sam? Man, I'm sorry."
5,3,TIM,"Well, actually, it's Samuel, so it's not quite as dumb as it sounds."
5,3,LINDSEY,Are you guys friends?
5,3,STEVE,Hunting buddies. With his dad. Samuel here is quite the hunter himself.
5,3,LINDSEY,Wow. You killed deer and things?
5,3,TIM,"Yeah, and things."
5,3,SAM,Um. Why don't I get you guys some drinks?
5,3,TIM,Sorry. Didn't mean to bust you back there.
5,3,SAM,No. It's all right. So what's up?
5,3,TIM,Bobby called.
5,3,SAM,And?
5,3,TIM,You were right. Major demon block party going on.
5,3,SAM,But why? What are they up to?
5,3,STEVE,Don't know yet.
5,3,REGGIE,Bobby told us you were off limits. That true?
5,3,SAM,"Yeah, that's right."
5,3,TIM,"That's fine in theory and all, but we could really use all hands on deck here."
5,3,SAM,I know you could. But I can't. I'm sorry.
5,3,STEVE,Why not?
5,3,SAM,It's personal.
5,3,TIM,"Look, man, what baggage is so heavy it can't be stowed away for the freaking apocalypse?"
5,3,SAM,Like I said—
5,3,REGGIE,Yeah. You're sorry. Heard it the first time.
5,3,TIM,"Suit yourself. More for us then, right?"
5,3,SAM,Good luck.
5,3,TIM,But hey. Beers are on you when we get back.
5,3,SAM,"Yeah, you bet."
5,3,LINDSEY,So your parents were drunk when they named you and you shoot Bambi?
5,3,SAM,It's a long story.
5,3,LINDSEY,That is it. Enough with the kung fu wandering the earth thing. I'm gonna buy you dinner and we're gonna talk.
5,3,SAM,"Lindsey, I can't."
5,3,LINDSEY,No. The only way to avoid bloodshed is to say yes.
5,3,DEAN,Hey. Relax.
5,3,CASTIEL,This is a den of iniquity. I should not be here.
5,3,DEAN,"Dude, you full-on rebelled against heaven. Iniquity is one of the perks."
5,3,DEAN,Showtime.
5,3,HOOKER,Hi. What's your name?
5,3,DEAN,Cas.
5,3,DEAN,His name is Cas. What's your name?
5,3,HOOKER,Chastity.
5,3,DEAN,Chastity.
5,3,DEAN,"Wow. Is that kismet or what, buddy? Well, he likes you, you like him, so dayenu."
5,3,CHASTITY,"Come on, baby."
5,3,DEAN,"Hey, listen. Take this."
5,3,DEAN,"If she asks for a credit card, no. Now just stick to the basics, okay? Do not order off the menu. Go get her, tiger."
5,3,DEAN,Don't make me push you.
5,3,DEAN,"Well, cheers to you."
5,3,CHASTITY,"Get out of my face! Leave me alone! Bastard! Screw you, jerk!"
5,3,CHASTITY,I'll kill you!
5,3,CHASTITY,Screw you too! God! Oh! Jerk!
5,3,DEAN,The hell did you do?
5,3,CASTIEL,I don't know. I just looked her in the eyes and told her it wasn't her fault that her father Gene ran off. It was because he hated his job at the post office.
5,3,DEAN,"Oh, no, man."
5,3,CASTIEL,What?
5,3,DEAN,"This whole industry runs on absent fathers. It's, it's the natural order."
5,3,DEAN,We should go. Come on.
5,3,CASTIEL,What's so funny?
5,3,DEAN,"Oh, nothing. Whoo. It's been a long time since I've laughed that hard. It's been more than a long time. Years."
5,3,LINDSEY,So...you gonna tell me who those guys back there really were? And don't say hunting buddies.
5,3,SAM,Okay. Um. We used to be in the same business together.
5,3,LINDSEY,What business?
5,3,SAM,How's your salad?
5,3,LINDSEY,"Witness protection, right? You're Mafia?"
5,3,SAM,I'm not Mafia.
5,3,LINDSEY,"Okay, I get it. Don't mean to pry, my bad."
5,3,SAM,"I used to be in business with my brother. Truth is I was pretty good at the job. But...I made some mistakes, I did some stuff I'm not so proud of, and people got hurt. A lot of people."
5,3,LINDSEY,What was your poison?
5,3,SAM,Sorry?
5,3,LINDSEY,"Come on. You were hooked on something, I know the look."
5,3,LINDSEY,Three years sober.
5,3,SAM,You work in a bar.
5,3,LINDSEY,"So do you. Look, Keith. I don't know you and I'm the last person to be giving advice, but I do know that no one has ever done anything so bad that they can't be forgiven. That they can't change."
5,3,CASTIEL,"When the oil burns, no angel can touch or pass through the flames, or he dies."
5,3,DEAN,"Okay, so we trap him in a steel cage of holy fire, but one question. How the hell do we get him here?"
5,3,CASTIEL,"Very simple. There's, well, almost an open phone line between a vessel and his angel. One just has to know how to dial."
5,3,CASTIEL,"I'm here, Raphael. Come and get me, you little bastard."
5,3,DEAN,"Just out of curiosity, what is the average customer wait time to speak to an archangel?"
5,3,CASTIEL,Be ready.
5,3,DEAN,Well that's a day I'll never get back.
5,3,CASTIEL,"Dean, wait."
5,3,RAPHAEL,Castiel.
5,3,CASTIEL,Raphael.
5,3,DEAN,And I thought you were supposed to be impressive. All you do is black out the room.
5,3,RAPHAEL,And the Eastern Seaboard.
5,3,RAPHAEL,It is a testament to my unending mercy that I do not smite you here and now.
5,3,DEAN,"Or maybe you're full of crap. Maybe you're afraid God will bring Cas back to life again and smite you and your candy-ass skirt. By the way, hi, I'm Dean."
5,3,RAPHAEL,"I know who you are. And now, thanks to him, I know where you are."
5,3,CASTIEL,You won't kill him. You wouldn't dare.
5,3,RAPHAEL,But I will take him to Michael.
5,3,DEAN,"Well then. Sounds terrifying. It does. But, uh, hate to tell you, I'm not going anywhere with you."
5,3,RAPHAEL,Surely you remember Zachariah giving you stomach cancer?
5,3,DEAN,"Yeah, that was, that was hilarious."
5,3,RAPHAEL,"Well, he doesn't have anything close to my imagination."
5,3,DEAN,Yeah? I bet you didn't imagine one thing.
5,3,RAPHAEL,What?
5,3,DEAN,"We knew you were coming, you stupid son of a bitch."
5,3,DEAN,"Don't look at me, it was his idea."
5,3,CASTIEL,Where is He?
5,3,RAPHAEL,"God? Didn't you hear? He's dead, Castiel. Dead."
5,3,SAM,Bar's closed.
5,3,SAM,Hey.
5,3,TIM,"Something you want to tell me, Sam?"
5,3,SAM,What? No.
5,3,TIM,You sure about that?
5,3,SAM,I—I don't know—jeez. Are you okay? Where are Reggie and Steve?
5,3,TIM,"Oh, Steve's good, he's, uh, his guts are lying roadside outside the Hawley Five and Dime."
5,3,SAM,I'm sorry.
5,3,TIM,"Sorry don't cut it, Sam."
5,3,SAM,What do you want me to say?
5,3,TIM,The truth.
5,3,TIM,"Okay, fine. Let me give you some of my own, then. We go into town, we catch ourselves a demon, we get jumped by ten more. Steve bought it."
5,3,SAM,I'm sorry.
5,3,TIM,"Saying it twice don't make it so, Sam. You see, this demon, he, uh, he told us things. Crazy things, things about you, Sam."
5,3,SAM,Demons lie.
5,3,TIM,Yeah. I'm gonna ask you one last time. The truth. Now.
5,3,SAM,Lindsey!
5,3,LINDSEY,What's going on?
5,3,RAPHAEL,But there's no other explanation. He's gone for good.
5,3,CASTIEL,You're lying.
5,3,RAPHAEL,Am I? Do you remember the twentieth century? Think the twenty-first is going any better? Do you think God would have let any of that happen if He were alive?
5,3,DEAN,Oh yeah? Well then who invented the Chinese basket trick?
5,3,RAPHAEL,"Careful. That's my Father you're talking about, boy."
5,3,DEAN,"Yeah, who would be so proud to know His sons started the frigging apocalypse."
5,3,RAPHAEL,Who ran off and disappeared. Who left no instructions and a world to run.
5,3,DEAN,"Daddy ran away and disappeared. He didn't happen to work for the post office, did He?"
5,3,RAPHAEL,This is funny to you? You're living in a godless universe.
5,3,DEAN,"And? What, you and the other kids just decided to throw an apocalypse while He was gone?"
5,3,RAPHAEL,We're tired. We just want it to be over. We just want...paradise.
5,3,DEAN,"So, what, God dies and makes you the boss and you decide you can do whatever you want?"
5,3,RAPHAEL,"Yes. And whatever we want, we get."
5,3,SAM,"Just take it easy, okay? Put the knife down."
5,3,SAM,"It's true. What the demons said, it's all true."
5,3,TIM,Keep going.
5,3,SAM,Why? You gonna hate me any less? Am I gonna hate myself any less? What do you want?
5,3,TIM,I want to hear you say it.
5,3,SAM,I did it. I started the apocalypse.
5,3,CASTIEL,"If God is dead, why have I returned? Who brought me back?"
5,3,RAPHAEL,Did it ever occur to you that maybe Lucifer raised you?
5,3,CASTIEL,No.
5,3,RAPHAEL,Think about it. He needs all the rebellious angels he can find. You know it adds up.
5,3,CASTIEL,Let's go.
5,3,RAPHAEL,"Castiel, I'm warning you. Do not leave me here. I will find you."
5,3,CASTIEL,"Maybe one day. But today, you're my little bitch."
5,3,DEAN,What he said.
5,3,SAM,What is that?
5,3,TIM,"What do you think it is? It's go juice, Sammy boy."
5,3,SAM,Get that away from me.
5,3,TIM,"Away from you? No. This is for you. Hell if that demon wasn't right as rain. Down the hatch, son."
5,3,SAM,You're insane.
5,3,TIM,"Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna drink this, Hulk out, and you're gonna waste every one of the demon scum that killed my best friend."
5,3,TIM,Or she dies.
5,3,SAM,You wouldn't do that.
5,3,TIM,It's funny how watching your best friend die changes that.
5,3,TIM,"Come on, you know you want it, Sam. Just reach out and take it."
5,3,TIM,"There, was that really so bad?"
5,3,SAM,Go.
5,3,TIM,Don't think we won't be back.
5,3,SAM,Don't think I won't be here.
5,3,DEAN,You okay?
5,3,DEAN,"Look, I'll be the first to tell you that this little crusade of yours is nuts, but I do know a little something about missing fathers."
5,3,CASTIEL,What do you mean?
5,3,DEAN,"I mean there were times when I was looking for my dad when all logic said that he was dead, but I knew in my heart he was still alive. Who cares what some ninja turtle says, Cas, what do you believe?"
5,3,CASTIEL,I believe he's out there.
5,3,DEAN,Good. Then go find him.
5,3,CASTIEL,What about you?
5,3,DEAN,"What about me? I don't know. Honestly, I'm good. I can't believe I'm saying that, but I am, I'm really good."
5,3,CASTIEL,Even without your brother?
5,3,DEAN,"Especially without my brother. I mean, I spent so much time worrying about the son of a bitch. I mean, I've had more fun with you in the past twenty-four hours than I've had with Sam in years, and you're not that much fun. It's funny, you know, I've been so chained to my family, but now that I'm alone, hell, I'm happy."
5,3,JESS,Sam. Sam.
5,3,JESS,So. This is your life now? Think you can just live forever with your head buried in the sand?
5,3,SAM,"I love you, Jess."
5,3,SAM,"God knows how much I miss you, too. But you're wrong. People can change. There is reason for hope."
5,3,JESS,"No, Sam. There isn't."
5,3,SAM,How can you be so sure?
5,3,LUCIFER,Because you freed me.
5,3,LUCIFER,That's right. You know who I am.
5,3,SAM,Lucifer.
5,3,LUCIFER,"You are a hard one to find, Sam. Harder than most humans. I don't suppose you'd tell me where you are?"
5,3,SAM,What do you want with me?
5,3,LUCIFER,"Thanks to you, I walk the earth. I want to give you a gift. I want to give you everything."
5,3,SAM,I don't want anything from you.
5,3,LUCIFER,"I'm so sorry, Sam, I, I really am, but Nick here is just an improvisation. Plan B. He can barely contain me without spontaneously combusting."
5,3,SAM,What are you talking about?
5,3,LUCIFER,"Why do you think you were in that chapel? You're the one, Sam. You're my vessel. My true vessel."
5,3,SAM,No.
5,3,LUCIFER,Yes.
5,3,SAM,No. That'll never happen.
5,3,LUCIFER,"I'm sorry, but it will. I will find you. And when I do, you will let me in. I'm sure of it."
5,3,SAM,You need my consent.
5,3,LUCIFER,Of course. I'm an angel.
5,3,SAM,I will kill myself before letting you in.
5,3,LUCIFER,I'll just bring you back.
5,3,LUCIFER,"Sam. My heart breaks for you. The weight on your shoulders, what you've done, what you still have to do. It is more than anyone could bear. If there was some other way...but there isn't. I will never lie to you. I will never trick you. But you will say yes to me."
5,3,SAM,You're wrong.
5,3,LUCIFER,I'm not. I think I know you better than you know yourself.
5,3,SAM,Why me?
5,3,LUCIFER,"Because it had to be you, Sam. It always had to be you."
5,4,DEAN,Something turned him into a monster.
5,4,SAM,More like demonic germ warfare.
5,4,DEAN,I'm a vessel?
5,4,DEAN,You need my consent.
5,4,DEAN,—to ride around in my skin.
5,4,ZACHARIAH,"Unfortunately, yes."
5,4,DEAN,The answer's no.
5,4,LUCIFER,You know who I am.
5,4,SAM,Lucifer.
5,4,LUCIFER,"You're the one, Sam. You're my vessel."
5,4,SAM,That'll never happen.
5,4,SAM,I know you don't trust me.
5,4,DEAN,So what are you saying?
5,4,SAM,I'm dangerous.
5,4,RELIGIOUS MAN,"Hi. Good evening, brother. Is your soul rapture-ready?"
5,4,RELIGIOUS MAN,"Thank you, sir. God bless."
5,4,RELIGIOUS MAN,"Good evening, folks. Is your soul rapture-ready? Because what I'd like to do is just show you exactly what God's love is for you."
5,4,RELIGIOUS MAN,"Okay, God bless."
5,4,RELIGIOUS MAN,"Excuse me, friend, but have you taken time out to think about God's plan for you?"
5,4,DEAN,"Too friggin' much, pal."
5,4,CASTIEL,We are.
5,4,DEAN,"Well, that doesn't make any sense. I mean, why would the demons keep a gun around that, uh, kills demons?"
5,4,CASTIEL,What? What? Did—I didn't—I didn't get that.
5,4,DEAN,"You know, it's kind of funny. Talking to a messenger of God on a cellphone. It's, you know, like watching a Hell's Angel ride a moped."
5,4,CASTIEL,"This isn't funny, Dean. The voice says I'm almost out of minutes."
5,4,DEAN,"Okay, all right. I'm—I'm telling you, Cas, the mooks have melted down the gun by now."
5,4,CASTIEL,"Well, I hear differently. And if it's true and if you are still set on the insane task of killing the devil, this is how we do it."
5,4,DEAN,Okay. Where do we start?
5,4,CASTIEL,Where are you now?
5,4,DEAN,Kansas City.
5,4,DEAN,"Century Hotel, room 113."
5,4,CASTIEL,I'll be there immediately.
5,4,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, come on, man. I just drove like sixteen hours straight, okay? I'm human. And there's stuff I got to do."
5,4,CASTIEL,What stuff?
5,4,DEAN,"Eat, for example. In this case, sleep. I just need like four hours once in a while, okay?"
5,4,CASTIEL,Yes.
5,4,DEAN,"Okay, so, you can pop in tomorrow morning."
5,4,CASTIEL,Yes. I'll just—
5,4,CASTIEL,"—wait here, then."
5,4,DEAN,"Damn it, Cas, I need to sleep!"
5,4,SAM,"Dean, it's me."
5,4,DEAN,Sam? It's quarter past four.
5,4,SAM,This is important.
5,4,DEAN,"So, you're his vessel, huh? Lucifer's wearing you to the prom?"
5,4,SAM,That's what he said.
5,4,DEAN,"Just when you thought you were out, they pull you back in, huh, Sammy?"
5,4,SAM,"So, that's it? That's your response?"
5,4,DEAN,What are you looking for?
5,4,SAM,I don't know. A—a little panic? Maybe?
5,4,DEAN,I guess I'm a little numb to the earth-shattering revelations at this point.
5,4,SAM,What are we gonna do about it?
5,4,DEAN,What do you want to do about it?
5,4,SAM,"I want back in, for starters."
5,4,DEAN,Sam—
5,4,SAM,"I mean it. I am sick of being a puppet to these sons of bitches. I'm gonna hunt him down, Dean."
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, so, we're back to revenge, then, are we? Yeah, 'cause that worked out so well last time."
5,4,SAM,Not revenge. Redemption.
5,4,DEAN,"So, what, you're just gonna walk back in and we're gonna be the dynamic duo again?"
5,4,SAM,"Look, Dean, I can do this. I can. I'm gonna prove it to you."
5,4,DEAN,"Look, Sam—it doesn't matter—whatever we do. I mean, it turns out that you and me, we're the, uh, the fire and the oil of the Armageddon. You know, on that basis alone, we should just pick a hemisphere. Stay away from each other for good."
5,4,SAM,"Dean, it does not have to be like this. We can fight it."
5,4,DEAN,"Yeah, you're right. We can. But not together. We're not stronger when we're together, Sam. I think we're weaker. Because whatever we have between us—love, family, whatever it is—they are always gonna use it against us. And you know that. Yeah, we're better off apart. We got a better chance of dodging Lucifer and Michael and this whole damn thing, if we just go our own ways."
5,4,SAM,"Dean, don't do this."
5,4,DEAN,"Bye, Sam."
5,4,DEAN,Little girl? Little girl?
5,4,DEAN,Are you hurt?
5,4,DEAN,"You know the not-talking thing is kind of creepy, right?"
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, crap."
5,4,DEAN,"August first, 2014."
5,4,DEAN,That's never a good sign.
5,4,ZACHARIAH,"""Croatoan pandemic reaches Australia."""
5,4,ZACHARIAH,"""President Palin defends bombing of Houston."" Certainly a buyer's market in real estate. Let's see what's happening in sports. That's right—no more sports. Congress revoked the right to group assembly. What's left of Congress, that is. Hardly a quorum, if you ask me."
5,4,DEAN,How did you find me?
5,4,ZACHARIAH,"Afraid we had to tap some unorthodox resources of late—human informants. We've been making inspirational visits to the fringier Christian groups. They've been given your image, told to keep an eye out."
5,4,DEAN,"The Bible freak outside the motel—he, what, dropped a dime on me?"
5,4,ZACHARIAH,"Onward, Christian soldiers."
5,4,DEAN,"Okay, well, good, great. You have had your jollies. Now send me back, you son of a bitch."
5,4,ZACHARIAH,"Oh, you'll get back—all in good time. We want you to marinate a bit."
5,4,DEAN,Marinate?
5,4,ZACHARIAH,"Three days, Dean. Three days to see where this course of action takes you."
5,4,DEAN,What's that supposed to mean?
5,4,ZACHARIAH,"It means that your choices have consequences. This is what happens to the world if you continue to say ""no"" to Michael. Have a little look-see."
5,4,DEAN,"Bobby? Bobby, I'm coming in!"
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, no."
5,4,DEAN,"Where is everybody, Bobby?"
5,4,DEAN,Camp Chitaqua.
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, baby, no."
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, no, baby, what did they do to you?"
5,4,DEAN,What the hell?
5,4,2014!DEAN,"I should be asking that question, don't you think? In fact, why don't you give me one good reason why I shouldn't gank you right here and now?"
5,4,DEAN,Because you'd only be hurting yourself.
5,4,2014!DEAN,Very funny.
5,4,DEAN,"Look, man—I'm no shapeshifter or demon or anything, okay?"
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Yeah, I know. I did the drill while you were out. Silver, salt, holy water—nothing. But you know what was funny? Was that you had every hidden lockpick, box cutter, and switchblade that I carry. Now, you want to explain that? Oh, and the, uh, resemblance, while you're at it?"
5,4,Dean,Zachariah.
5,4,2014!DEAN,Come again?
5,4,Dean,I'm you from the tail end of 2009. Zach plucked me from my bed and threw me five years into the future.
5,4,2014!DEAN,Where is he? I want to talk to him.
5,4,Dean,I don't know.
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Oh, you don't know."
5,4,DEAN,"No, I don't know. Look, I just want to get back to my own friggin' year, okay?"
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Okay. If you're me, then tell me something only I would know."
5,4,DEAN,"Rhonda Hurley. We were, uh, nineteen. She made us try on her panties. They were pink. And satiny. And you know what? We kind of liked it."
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Touché. So, what, Zach zapped you up here to see how bad it gets?"
5,4,DEAN,"I guess. Croatoan virus, right? That's their endgame?"
5,4,2014!DEAN,"It's efficient, it's incurable, and it's scary as hell. Turns people into monsters. Started hitting the major cities about two years ago. World really went in the crapper after that."
5,4,DEAN,What about Sam?
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Heavyweight showdown in Detroit. From what I understand, Sam didn't make it."
5,4,DEAN,You weren't with him?
5,4,2014!DEAN,"No. No, me and Sam, we haven't talked in—hell, five years."
5,4,DEAN,We never tried to find him?
5,4,2014!DEAN,We had other people to worry about.
5,4,DEAN,Where you going?
5,4,2014!DEAN,I got to run an errand.
5,4,DEAN,Whoa. You're just gonna leave me here?
5,4,DEAN,"Okay. All right. Fine. But you don't have to cuff me, man. Oh, come on. You don't trust yourself?"
5,4,2014!DEAN,No. Absolutely not.
5,4,DEAN,Dick.
5,4,CHUCK,"Hey, Dean. You got a second?"
5,4,DEAN,"No—yes. Uh, I—I guess. Hi, Chuck."
5,4,CHUCK,"Hi. So, uh, listen, we're pretty good on canned goods for now, but we're down to next to nothing on perishables and—and hygiene supplies. People are not gonna be happy about this. So, what do you think we should do?"
5,4,DEAN,"I—I don't know. Maybe, uh, share? You know, like at a kibbutz."
5,4,CHUCK,Wait a minute. aren't you supposed to be out on a mission right now?
5,4,Dean,Absolutely. And I will be.
5,4,CHUCK,Uh-oh.
5,4,DEAN,"Whoa! Jeez! Easy, lady!"
5,4,CHUCK,Risa.
5,4,DEAN,Risa?
5,4,RISA,"You spent the night in Jane's cabin last night, didn't you?"
5,4,DEAN,"Uh, what? I—I don't—did I?"
5,4,RISA,I thought we had a 'connection'.
5,4,DEAN,"Well, I'm sure that we do."
5,4,RISA,Yeah?
5,4,CHUCK,"Hi, Risa."
5,4,RISA,Screw you.
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, jeez. I'm getting busted for stuff I haven't even done yet."
5,4,CHUCK,What?
5,4,DEAN,"Uh, never mind. Hey, Chuck, is...Cas still here?"
5,4,CHUCK,Yeah. I don't think Cas is going anywhere.
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"So, in this way. We're each a fragment of total perception—just, uh, one compartment in that dragonfly eye of group mind. Now, the key to this total, shared perception—it's, um, it's surprisingly physical."
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"Oh. Excuse me, ladies. I think I need to confer with our fearless leader for a minute. Why not go get washed up for the orgy?"
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,You're all so beautiful.
5,4,DEAN,"What are you, a hippie?"
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,I thought you'd gotten over trying to label me.
5,4,DEAN,"Cas, we got to talk."
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,Whoa. Strange.
5,4,DEAN,What?
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"You...are not you. Not now you, anyway."
5,4,DEAN,"No! Yeah. Yes, exactly."
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,What year are you from?
5,4,DEAN,2009.
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,Who did this to you? Is it Zachariah?
5,4,DEAN,Yes.
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,Interesting.
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, yeah, it's friggin' fascinating. Now. Why don't you strap on your angel wings and fly me back to my page on the calendar?"
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"I wish I could just, uh, strap on my wings, but I'm sorry, no dice."
5,4,DEAN,"What, are you stoned?"
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"Uh, generally, yeah."
5,4,DEAN,What happened to you?
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,Life.
5,4,DEAN,Hey. Hey! Watch out!
5,4,2014!DEAN,Damn it.
5,4,2014!DEAN,"I'm not gonna lie to you. Me and him—It's a pretty messed-up situation we got going. But believe me, when you need to know something, you will know it. Until then, we all have work to do."
5,4,2014!DEAN,What the hell was that?
5,4,DEAN,What the hell was that? You just shot a guy in cold blood.
5,4,2014!DEAN,We were in an open quarantine zone. Got ambushed by some Croats on the way out.
5,4,2014!DEAN,Croats. Croatoans. One of them infected Yeager.
5,4,DEAN,How do you know?
5,4,2014!DEAN,"'Cause after a few years of this, I know. I started seeing symptoms about a half an hour ago. Wasn't gonna be long before he flipped. I didn't see the point in troubling a good man with bad news."
5,4,DEAN,'Troubling a good man'? You just blew him away in front of your own people. Don't you think that freaked them out a little bit?
5,4,2014!DEAN,"It's 2014. Plugging some Croat, it's called commonplace. Trading words with my friggin' clone—that might have freaked them out a little."
5,4,DEAN,"All right, look—"
5,4,2014!DEAN,"No, you look. This isn't your time. It's mine. You don't make the decisions. I do. So, when I say stay in, you stay in."
5,4,DEAN,"All right, man. I'm sorry. Look, I—I'm not trying to mess you—me—us up here."
5,4,2014!DEAN,I know.
5,4,DEAN,It's just been a really wacky weekend.
5,4,2014!DEAN,Tell me about it.
5,4,DEAN,"What was the mission, anyway?"
5,4,DEAN,The Colt?
5,4,2014!DEAN,The Colt.
5,4,DEAN,Where was it?
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Everywhere. They've been moving it around. Took me five years, but...I finally got it. And tonight—tonight, I'm gonna kill the devil."
5,4,RISA,"So, that's it? That's the Colt?"
5,4,2014!DEAN,"If anything can kill Lucifer, this is it."
5,4,2014!DEAN,Are you okay?
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, we were in, uh, Jane's cabin last night. And, apparently, we and...Risa have a connection."
5,4,2014!DEAN,You want to shut up?
5,4,2014!DEAN,"We don't have to find Lucifer. We know where he is. The demon that we caught last week, he was one of the big guy's entourage. He knew."
5,4,RISA,"So, a demon tells you where Satan's gonna be, and you just believe it?"
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Oh, trust me, he wasn't lying."
5,4,RISA,And you know this how?
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"Our fearless leader, I'm afraid, is all too well schooled in the art of getting to the truth."
5,4,DEAN,"Torture? Oh, so, we're—we're torturing again."
5,4,DEAN,"No, that's—that's good. Classy."
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,What? I like past you.
5,4,2014!DEAN,Lucifer is here. Now. I know the block and I know the building.
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"Oh, good—it's right in the middle of a hot zone."
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Crawling with Croats, yeah. You saying my plan is reckless?"
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"Are you saying we, uh, walk in straight up the driveway, past all the demons and the Croats, and we shoot the devil?"
5,4,2014!DEAN,Yes.
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"Okay, if you don't like, uh, 'reckless', I could use 'insouciant', maybe."
5,4,2014!DEAN,Are you coming?
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"Of course. But why is he? I mean, he's you five years ago. If something happens to him, you're gone, right?"
5,4,2014!DEAN,He's coming.
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"Okay. Well, uh. I'll get the grunts moving."
5,4,2014!DEAN,We're loaded and on the road by midnight.
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,All righty.
5,4,DEAN,Why are you taking me?
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Relax. You'll be fine. Zach's looking after you, right?"
5,4,DEAN,"No, that's not what I mean. I want to know what's going on."
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Yeah, okay. You're coming because I want you to see something. I want you to see our brother."
5,4,DEAN,Sam? I thought he was dead.
5,4,2014!DEAN:,Sam didn't die in Detroit. He said 'yes'.
5,4,DEAN,'Yes'?
5,4,DEAN,Wait. You mean—
5,4,2014!DEAN,That's right. The big 'yes'. To the devil. Lucifer's wearing him to the prom.
5,4,DEAN,Why would he do that?
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Wish I knew. But now we don't have a choice. It's in him, and it's not getting out. And we've got to kill him, Dean. And you need to see it—the whole damn thing, how bad it gets—so you can do it different."
5,4,DEAN,What do you mean?
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Zach said he was gonna bring you back, right? To oh-nine?"
5,4,DEAN,Yeah.
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Well, when you get back home—you say 'yes'. You hear me? Say 'yes' to Michael."
5,4,DEAN,"That's crazy. If I let him in, then Michael fights the devil. The battle's gonna torch half the planet."
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Look around you, man. Half the planet's better than no planet, which is what we have now. If I could do it over again, I'd say 'yes' in a heartbeat."
5,4,DEAN,So why don't you?
5,4,2014!DEAN,"I've tried! I've shouted 'yes' till I was blue in the face! The angels aren't listening! They just—left—gave up! It's too late for me, but for you—"
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, no. There's got to be another way."
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Yeah, that's what I thought. I was cocky. Never actually thought I'd lose. But I was wrong. Dean. I was wrong. I'm begging you. Say yes."
5,4,2014!DEAN,"But you won't. 'Cause I didn't. Because that's just not us, is it?"
5,4,CHUCK,"So, you're really from oh-nine?"
5,4,DEAN,"Yeah, afraid so."
5,4,CHUCK,"Some free advice? You ever get back there, you hoard toilet paper. You understand me? Hoard it. Hoard it like it's made of gold. 'Cause it is."
5,4,DEAN,"Thank you, Chuck."
5,4,CHUCK,"Oh, you'll thank me, all right. Mark my words."
5,4,DEAN,I'll see you around.
5,4,CHUCK,Yeah. Okay.
5,4,DEAN,Let me see those.
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,You want some?
5,4,DEAN,Amphetamines?
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,It's the perfect antidote to that absinthe.
5,4,DEAN,"Mmm. Don't get me wrong, Cas. I, uh. I'm happy that the stick is out of your ass, but—what's going on—w-with the drugs and the orgies and the love-guru crap?"
5,4,DEAN,What's so funny?
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"Dean, I'm not an angel anymore."
5,4,DEAN,What?
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"Yeah, I went mortal."
5,4,DEAN,What do you mean? How?
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"I think it had something to do with the other angels leaving. But when they bailed, my mojo just kind of— psshhew!—drained away. And now, you know, I'm practically human. I mean, Dean, I'm all but useless. Last year, broke my foot, laid up for two months."
5,4,DEAN,Wow.
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,Yeah.
5,4,DEAN,"So, you're human. Well, welcome to the club."
5,4,2014!CASTIEL,"Thanks. Except I used to belong to a much better club. And now I'm powerless. I'm hapless, I'm hopeless. I mean, why the hell not bury myself in women and decadence, right? It's the end, baby. That's what decadence is for. Why not bang a few gongs before the lights go out? But then that's, that's just how I roll."
5,4,2014!DEAN,There. Second-floor window. We go in there.
5,4,RISA,You sure about this?
5,4,2014!DEAN,"They'll never see us coming. Trust me. Now, weapons check. We're on the move in five."
5,4,DEAN,"Hey, uh, me. Can I talk to you for a sec?"
5,4,DEAN,Tell me what's going on.
5,4,2014!DEAN,What?
5,4,DEAN,I know you. You're lying to these people and to me.
5,4,2014!DEAN,Is that so.
5,4,DEAN,"Yeah. See, I know your lying expressions. I've seen them in the mirror. Now, there's something you're not telling us."
5,4,2014!DEAN,I don't know what you're talking about.
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, really? Well, I don't seem to be the only member of your posse with some questions, so, uh, maybe I'll just take my doubts over to them."
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait."
5,4,DEAN,What?
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Take a look around you, man. This place should be white-hot with Croats. Where are they?"
5,4,DEAN,They cleared a path for us. Which means that this is—
5,4,2014!DEAN,A trap. Exactly.
5,4,DEAN,"Well, then we can't go through the front."
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Oh, we're not. They are. They're the decoys. You and me, we're going in through the back."
5,4,DEAN,"You mean you're gonna feed your friends into a meat grinder? Cas, too? You want to use their deaths as a diversion?"
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, man, something is broken in you. You're making decisions that I would never make. I wouldn't sacrifice my friends."
5,4,2014!DEAN,"You're right. You wouldn't. It's one of the main reasons we're in this mess, actually."
5,4,DEAN,These people count on you. They trust you.
5,4,2014!DEAN,They trust me to kill the devil and to save the world and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
5,4,DEAN,"No. Not like this, you're not. I'm not gonna let you."
5,4,2014!DEAN,"Oh, really?"
5,4,DEAN,Yeah.
5,4,LUCIFER,"Oh. Hello, Dean."
5,4,LUCIFER,Aren't you a surprise.
5,4,LUCIFER,"You've come a long way to see this, haven't you?"
5,4,DEAN,"Well, go ahead. Kill me."
5,4,LUCIFER,Kill you?
5,4,LUCIFER,Don't you think that would be a little...redundant?
5,4,LUCIFER,"I'm sorry. It must be painful, speaking to me in this—shape. But it had to be your brother. It had to be."
5,4,LUCIFER,"You don't have to be afraid of me, Dean. What do you think I'm going to do?"
5,4,DEAN,I don't know. Maybe deep-fry the planet?
5,4,LUCIFER,Why? Why would I want to destroy this stunning thing? Beautiful in a trillion different ways. The last perfect handiwork of God.
5,4,LUCIFER,You ever hear the story of how I fell from grace?
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, good God, you're not gonna tell me a bedtime story, are you? My stomach's almost out of bile."
5,4,LUCIFER,You know why God cast me down? Because I loved him. More than anything. And then God created...
5,4,LUCIFER,"You. The little...hairless apes. And then he asked all of us to bow down before you—to love you, more than him. And I said, ""Father, I can't."" I said, ""These human beings are flawed, murderous."" And for that, God had Michael cast me into hell. Now, tell me, does the punishment fit the crime? Especially, when I was right? Look at what six billion of you have done to this thing, and how many of you blame me for it."
5,4,DEAN,"You're not fooling me, you know that? With this sympathy-for-the-devil crap. I know what you are."
5,4,LUCIFER,What am I?
5,4,DEAN,"You're the same thing, only bigger. The same brand of cockroach I've been squashing my whole life. An ugly, evil, belly-to-the-ground, supernatural piece of crap. The only difference between them and you is the size of your ego."
5,4,LUCIFER,"I like you, Dean. I get what the other angels see in you. Goodbye. We'll meet again soon."
5,4,DEAN,You better kill me now!
5,4,LUCIFER,Pardon?
5,4,DEAN,"You better kill me now. Or I swear, I will find a way to kill you. And I won't stop."
5,4,LUCIFER,"I know you won't. I know you won't say yes to Michael, either. And I know you won't kill Sam. Whatever you do, you will always end up here. Whatever choices you make, whatever details you alter, we will always end up—here. I win. So, I win."
5,4,DEAN,You're wrong.
5,4,LUCIFER,"See you in five years, Dean."
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, well, if it isn't the ghost of Christmas screw you."
5,4,ZACHARIAH,"Enough. Dean, enough. You saw it, right? You saw what happens. You're the only person who can prove the devil wrong. Just say yes."
5,4,DEAN,How do I know that this whole thing isn't one of your tricks? Huh? Some angel hocus-pocus?
5,4,ZACHARIAH,The time for tricks is over. Give yourself to Michael. Say yes and we can strike. Before Lucifer gets to Sam. Before billions die.
5,4,DEAN,Nah.
5,4,ZACHARIAH,'Nah'? You telling me you haven't learned your lesson?
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, I've learned a lesson, all right. Just not the one you wanted to teach."
5,4,ZACHARIAH,"Well, I'll just have to teach it again! Because I got you now, boy, and I'm never letting you—"
5,4,ZACHARIAH,Son of a...
5,4,DEAN,"That's pretty nice timing, Cas."
5,4,CASTIEL,We had an appointment.
5,4,DEAN,Don't ever change.
5,4,CASTIEL,How did Zachariah find you?
5,4,DEAN,"Long story. Let's just stay away from Jehovah's Witnesses from now on, okay?"
5,4,CASTIEL,What are you doing?
5,4,DEAN,Something I should have done in the first place.
5,4,DEAN,Sam.
5,4,DEAN,If you're serious and you want back in...you should hang on to this. I'm sure you're rusty.
5,4,DEAN,"Look, man, I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm...whatever I need to be. But I was, uh—wrong."
5,4,SAM,What made you change your mind?
5,4,DEAN,"Long story. The point is...maybe we are each other's Achilles heel. Maybe they'll find a way to use us against each other, I don't know. I just know we're all we've got. More than that. We keep each other human."
5,4,SAM,Thank you. Really. Thank you. I won't let you down.
5,4,DEAN,"Oh, I know it. I mean, you are the second-best hunter on the planet."
5,4,SAM,"So, what do we do now?"
5,4,DEAN,We make our own future.
5,4,SAM,Guess we have no choice.
5,5,DEAN,You chose a demon over your own brother. I just don't think I can trust you.
5,5,DEAN,"Well, have you?"
5,5,SAM,I know you don't trust me.
5,5,DEAN,So what are you saying?
5,5,SAM,Maybe it's best we just go our separate ways.
5,5,DEAN,"Well, I think you're right."
5,5,LUCIFER,"You're the one, Sam. You're my vessel."
5,5,SAM,That'll never happen.
5,5,ZACHARIAH,You're the Michael sword.
5,5,DEAN,"What do you mean, I'm the sword?"
5,5,ZACHARIAH,You're Michael's weapon.
5,5,DEAN,I'm a vessel?
5,5,SAM,I won't let you down.
5,5,DEAN,"Oh, I know it."
5,5,JIM,"All right, buddy, what's so important you couldn't tell me over the phone?"
5,5,CAL,"Trust me, Jim. It's important."
5,5,JIM,"Wait a minute, you're not...you're not telling me that this is—"
5,5,CAL,Yep.
5,5,JIM,You found it?
5,5,JIM,You found it. Huh.
5,5,JIM,Oh my God! You sure?
5,5,CAL,VIN numbers match.
5,5,JIM,How much you pay?
5,5,CAL,A lot.
5,5,JIM,"Come on, how much?"
5,5,CAL,A lot.
5,5,JIM,I bet. Wow.
5,5,JIM,Wow. You start her up yet?
5,5,CAL,Been waiting for you.
5,5,JIM,"Yeah, waiting to rub my nose in it, right?"
5,5,CAL,Exactly.
5,5,JIM,"Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. We need to record this for posterity's sake."
5,5,CAL,Great idea.
5,5,JIM,"Yeah, great idea."
5,5,JIM,"Oh, man."
5,5,JIM,Cal? Cal?
5,5,JIM,"Hey, you all right, man? I thought I heard something. Cal? Is something wrong?"
5,5,JIM,"Oh my God, Cal."
5,5,JIM,Cal!
5,5,SAM,So—
5,5,SAM,—what's with this job?
5,5,DEAN,Dude suffers a head-on collision in a parked car? I'd say that's worth checking out.
5,5,SAM,"Yeah, definitely, uh, but, uh, we got bigger problems, don't you think?"
5,5,DEAN,I'm sure the apocalypse'll still be there when we get back.
5,5,SAM,"Right, yeah, but I mean, if—if the Colt is really out there somewhere—"
5,5,DEAN,"Hey, we've been looking for three weeks, we got bupkis."
5,5,SAM,"Okay. But Dean...I mean, if we're gonna—ice the Devil—"
5,5,DEAN,This is what we're doing! Okay? End of discussion.
5,5,DEAN,"It's just that this is our first real case, back at it together. You know, I, I think we oughta ease into it, put the training wheels back on."
5,5,SAM,So you think I need training wheels.
5,5,DEAN,"No, 'we'. 'We' need training wheels, you and me. As a team. Okay?"
5,5,SAM,Okay.
5,5,DEAN,"Man, I really want this to be a fresh start, you know? For the both of us."
5,5,SAM,Okay.
5,5,DEAN,Agents Bonham and Copeland.
5,5,SHERIFF,Rick Carnegie. Good to know ya. So you're here on account of Cal Hawkins' death?
5,5,SAM,That's right.
5,5,CARNEGIE,"Well, 'fraid you came a long way for nothing. We already booked the guy that did it."
5,5,SAM,I'm sorry; who do you think did it?
5,5,CARNEGIE,Sicko taped his own handiwork.
5,5,SAM,I don't follow.
5,5,CARNEGIE,It was Jim Grossman that killed Cal.
5,5,DEAN,"Wait, what?"
5,5,CARNEGIE,"Well, he was the only one on the scene for miles."
5,5,SAM,They were best friends.
5,5,CARNEGIE,Most violent crimes are committed by someone close to the victim.
5,5,DEAN,And how exactly did Jim slam Cal into a windshield with all the force of an eighty-mile-per-hour crash?
5,5,CARNEGIE,"Drugs, maybe?"
5,5,CARNEGIE,"Look, you know this ain't brain surgery, boys! Whatever it looks like, that's what it usually is. It's simple."
5,5,DEAN,Simple. Right.
5,5,SAM,"Right. Um, if you don't mind, we'd like to speak to Jim Grossman anyway."
5,5,JIM,"I was in the house when it happened, I didn't even see it."
5,5,DEAN,"For argument's sake, say we believe you."
5,5,JIM,Why would you? The cops didn't.
5,5,DEAN,Well we're not your typical cops.
5,5,SAM,"Please, just tell us what you saw."
5,5,JIM,"It's not what I saw, it's what I heard. Tires squealing, glass breaking."
5,5,JIM,It was the car that did it.
5,5,SAM,The car?
5,5,JIM,"I mean, I heard about the curse, but, I just thought it was a load of crap."
5,5,DEAN,"Curse, what do you—what do you mean, curse?"
5,5,JIM,The car. Little Bastard.
5,5,SAM,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, uh, what's Little Bastard?"
5,5,DEAN,It's James Dean's car. It's the one he was killed in.
5,5,JIM,"Yeah, that's the one. Cal had been looking for it for years. I mean, hell, we both had. But he found it first."
5,5,DEAN,"Oh, we are definitely checking this out."
5,5,SAM,"So, what, this is, like, Christine?"
5,5,DEAN,Christine is fiction. This—
5,5,DEAN,This is real.
5,5,SAM,Okay.
5,5,SAM,Enlighten me.
5,5,DEAN,"Well after James Dean died, his mechanic—"
5,5,DEAN,"—bought the wreckage, and he fixed it up."
5,5,DEAN,And it repaid him by...
5,5,DEAN,Falling on him.
5,5,DEAN,And Tony McHenry was killed when it locked up on the racetrack.
5,5,DEAN,"I mean, death follows this car around like exhaust. Nobody touches it and comes away in one piece."
5,5,SAM,Hm.
5,5,DEAN,"Then, in nineteen-seventy, it vanished off the back of a truck. Nobody's ever seen it since."
5,5,DEAN,"I'm telling you, man, if this—if this car is Little Bastard, I will bet you dollars to donuts it's what killed the guy."
5,5,SAM,So how do we find out?
5,5,DEAN,"Cal matched the VIN number, but the only real way to know is the engine number."
5,5,SAM,I'm guessing the engine number—?
5,5,DEAN,On the engine. Yeah.
5,5,SAM,You want me to do it?
5,5,DEAN,"No. ...No, no, I've—I've got it."
5,5,DEAN,"Okay, baby. I'm not gonna hurt you, so...don't hurt me."
5,5,SAM,Need a flashlight?
5,5,DEAN,"No. Don't...do anything, just go away."
5,5,SAM,"You—uh, okay."
5,5,DEAN,"Don't speak. All right? In fact, don't even look at her, she might not like it."
5,5,DEAN,"Find out who owned it. Not just the last owner, you gotta take it all the way back to nineteen-fifty-five."
5,5,SAM,That's a lot of research.
5,5,DEAN,"Well, I guess I just made your afternoon."
5,5,DEAN,"So, you wanna be an actress, huh?"
5,5,BARTENDER,Yeah.
5,5,DEAN,"That is—that is so funny, because, I am actually—"
5,5,DEAN,—an agent for William Morris Endeavor.
5,5,BARTENDER,Wow.
5,5,DEAN,You mind filling me up again?
5,5,BARTENDER,Yeah.
5,5,DEAN,"Thanks, hey, you're a star. All right?"
5,5,DEAN,Yo.
5,5,SAM,"Hey. Took me a while, but I traced all the car's previous owners."
5,5,DEAN,Any of 'em die bloody?
5,5,SAM,Nope. In fact—
5,5,SAM,"Dean, are you in a bar?"
5,5,DEAN,"No, I—I'm—I'm in a restaurant."
5,5,BARTENDER,Here's your beer.
5,5,DEAN,Thanks.
5,5,DEAN,That happens to have a bar.
5,5,SAM,I've been working my ass off here.
5,5,DEAN,"Hey, world's smallest violin, pal, I spent the afternoon up Christine's skirt. I needed a drink."
5,5,SAM,"Actually, you didn't."
5,5,DEAN,Meaning?
5,5,SAM,The car's first owner was a cardiologist in Philadelphia; drove it 'til he died in nineteen-seventy-two.
5,5,DEAN,So you're saying?
5,5,SAM,"That Porsche is not, nor has it ever been, James Dean's car. It's a fake Little Bastard."
5,5,DEAN,Well then what was it that killed the guy?
5,5,SAM,Good question.
5,5,CONSUELA,"Okay Mister Hill, I finish."
5,5,HILL,"Thank you, Consuela. Have a good night."
5,5,HILL,Oh my God. It's you.
5,5,HILL,You're dead. You're supposed to be dead.
5,5,HILL,"No. No, no, no."
5,5,CARNEGIE,"I want you to use a, a fine-tooth comb. The evidence is here, we just gotta find it."
5,5,DEAN,Heard you got another weird one.
5,5,CARNEGIE,"Uh, well, it's a—it's a little strange on the surface, I admit, but, uh...you know, once you—you look at the facts..."
5,5,SAM,"William Hill died from a gunshot wound to the head. No gun, no gunpowder, no bullet."
5,5,DEAN,Nope. Nothing strange about that.
5,5,CARNEGIE,Well there's gotta be a reasonable explanation. There always is.
5,5,DEAN,Well what's your reasonable explanation?
5,5,CARNEGIE,Professional killer.
5,5,SAM,Come again?
5,5,CARNEGIE,"Well, CIA, NSA, one o' them trained assassins, like in Michael Clayton."
5,5,DEAN,Right.
5,5,CARNEGIE,"You're welcome to look around, but—but these guys don't leave fingerprints."
5,5,SAM,Mind if we talk with the witness?
5,5,CARNEGIE,Be my guest. She's not making any sense! And she's not making any sense in Spanish either.
5,5,DEAN,Right.
5,5,CONSUELA,No puedo vivir aquí. Necesito mi familia. Me voy ahora. Me voy a la casa. No—me voy a la casa en El Salvador ahora.
5,5,DEAN,Consuela Alvarez?
5,5,CONSUELA,Yes?
5,5,DEAN,FBI.
5,5,DEAN,"Now, uh, you said you saw something in the professor's house. Right? Something in the window?"
5,5,CONSUELA,Estaba sacando la basura. Imiré por la ventana y vi al hombre que mató al Señor Hill!
5,5,SAM,"Uh, Señora Alvarez. Cálmese, por favor. Uh—"
5,5,SAM,"Uh, díganos lo que vio?"
5,5,DEAN,Nice.
5,5,SAM,Freshman Spanish.
5,5,CONSUELA,Era alto. Muy alto. Y llevaba el abrigo negro largo y tenía bigotes.
5,5,SAM,"Okay, uh, a tall man, very tall. With a long black coat and a—"
5,5,SAM,A beard?
5,5,SAM,Beard.
5,5,CONSUELA,Y un sombrero.
5,5,DEAN,Dude was wearing a sombrero?
5,5,SAM,"Uh, a hat, not a—a—"
5,5,CONSUELA,"No, no, no, un sombrero alto."
5,5,SAM,A tall hat?
5,5,DEAN,"Oh, like a top hat."
5,5,CONSUELA,Un sombrero alto.
5,5,CONSUELA,Muy alto!
5,5,DEAN,"What, you mean like a—like a stovepipe hat."
5,5,CONSUELA,Sí.
5,5,DEAN,"Oh yeah, like Abraham Lincoln."
5,5,CONSUELA,Sí. El Presidente Lincoln.
5,5,CONSUELA,Abraham Lincoln kill Mister Hill!
5,5,DEAN,Huh.
5,5,CONSUELA,S-so I go home now?
5,5,SAM,"Uh, sí. Gracias."
5,5,DEAN,Gracias.
5,5,DEAN,Whoa.
5,5,SAM,What?
5,5,DEAN,It's a freeze-frame from Jim Grossman's video.
5,5,DEAN,"Am I crazy, or does that look like James Dean?"
5,5,SAM,That looks like James Dean.
5,5,DEAN,Famous ghosts?
5,5,SAM,Maybe.
5,5,DEAN,Well that's just silly.
5,5,SAM,"No, actually, uh, there is a ton of lore on famous ghosts. More than the, you know, not-famous kinds. I'm actually surprised we haven't run into one before."
5,5,DEAN,"Yeah, but now we got two of 'em? Two extremely pissed-off ghosts?"
5,5,SAM,Who are apparently ganking their fans.
5,5,DEAN,What do you mean?
5,5,SAM,Professor Hill was a Civil War nut. He dug Lincoln.
5,5,DEAN,And Cal must've been a James Dean freak. He spent seventeen years of his life tracking down the guy's car.
5,5,DEAN,"So you're saying we've got two super-famous, super-pissed-off ghosts killing their...super-fans?"
5,5,SAM,That's what it looks like.
5,5,DEAN,"Well, that is muchos loco."
5,5,SAM,'Muy'.
5,5,SAM,Not 'muchos'.
5,5,DEAN,"Yeah, well, the big question is, what the hell are they doing here?"
5,5,SAM,"Yeah. Ghosts usually haunt the places they live. I mean, I, I get Abraham Lincoln at the White House—"
5,5,DEAN,"And James Dean at a race track, but...what the hell are they doing in Canton?"
5,5,SAM,You gotta be kidding me.
5,5,DEAN,What?
5,5,DEAN,You gotta be kidding me.
5,5,DEAN,"Dude, he's short."
5,5,SAM,Hey. Gandhi was a great man.
5,5,DEAN,"Yeah, for a Smurf."
5,5,OWNER,"Sorry to keep you waiting, this is our busiest time of the year."
5,5,DEAN,This is busy?
5,5,OWNER,"Well, not right now, but it's early."
5,5,DEAN,It's four-thirty.
5,5,OWNER,"So, what can I do for you?"
5,5,DEAN,"Yeah, on how, uh, totally non-sucky wax museums are."
5,5,OWNER,"That's fantastic. A little press, just what we need."
5,5,SAM,"Great. Well we're interested in a few of your exhibits, specifically Abraham Lincoln and, uh, James Dean."
5,5,OWNER,Two of our most popular displays.
5,5,SAM,Oh yeah? So they bring in a lot of visitors?
5,5,OWNER,"Yeah, we have our regulars."
5,5,DEAN,"I don't suppose that, uh, William Hill and Cal Hawkins were regulars, were they?"
5,5,OWNER,"As a matter of fact, they were. Yeah, I heard what happened to them. It's tragic, just tragic. Oh—you—that's not gonna be in the article, is it?"
5,5,SAM,"No. No, no. 'Course not."
5,5,DEAN,"You know, I gotta tell you, that—that Lincoln is so lifelike, I mean, you—I mean, you can just imagine him moving around. You ever see anything like that?"
5,5,OWNER,Uh...no.
5,5,DEAN,No?
5,5,SAM,"Well, um, is there anything you could think of that would make your museum...unusual? You know, for the article?"
5,5,OWNER,"Well, I'll say. There isn't another place like us, not anywhere."
5,5,DEAN,How so?
5,5,OWNER,"Well, for one, that's Honest Abe's real hat."
5,5,SAM,It is?
5,5,DEAN,Almost like his remains.
5,5,OWNER,Uh...I guess?
5,5,SAM,"You wouldn't happen to have any of James Dean's personal effects, would you?"
5,5,OWNER,"Ooh, yeah. Got his keychain. We got a bunch of stuff, uh, Gandhi's bifocals, FDR's iron lung. This."
5,5,SAM,And who did that belong to?
5,5,OWNER,The Fonz. Seasons two through four!
5,5,SAM,"W-wow. Yeah, that's—that's really cool...ish."
5,5,OWNER,This? This is nothing. I've been working on a new collection of figures. Stuff that'll really wow the kids.
5,5,DEAN,The kids?
5,5,OWNER,"Yeah, Gen Y."
5,5,OWNER,"Computer games, cell phones, sexting."
5,5,OWNER,They're just fads. I'm gonna make wax museums hip again.
5,5,DEAN,"Yeah, Abraham Lincoln and James Dean, can you believe that? ...Why so kill-crazy? Ah, maybe the apocalypse has got 'em all hot and bothered. Yeah, well, we all know whose fault that is. ...Well I'm sorry, but it's true."
5,5,DEAN,I'll call you later. Bye.
5,5,SAM,What's going on?
5,5,DEAN,Did you get the trunk packed up?
5,5,SAM,"Yeah, trunk's packed. Who was on the phone?"
5,5,DEAN,Bobby.
5,5,SAM,And?
5,5,DEAN,Nothing.
5,5,SAM,So we're just gonna pretend I didn't hear what I just heard?
5,5,DEAN,Pretend or don't pretend. Whatever floats your boat.
5,5,SAM,"This was supposed to be a fresh start, Dean."
5,5,DEAN,"Well, this is about as fresh as it gets. Now are we going or not?"
5,5,DEAN,Check it out.
5,5,DEAN,"Four score and seven years ago, I had a funny hat."
5,5,SAM,Dean.
5,5,DEAN,We can't have any fun with this?
5,5,SAM,"Let's just torch the objects, torch the ghosts, get outta here. Okay?"
5,5,DEAN,I'll go grab East of Eden's keychain.
5,5,SAM,Dean?
5,5,SAM,Dean?
5,5,SAM,Dean!
5,5,DEAN,Is that Gandhi?
5,5,SAM,Yeah!
5,5,DEAN,"Dude, he's squirrelly."
5,5,SAM,Get the—
5,5,SAM,Do it!
5,5,DEAN,Get the what?
5,5,SAM,Glasses!
5,5,DEAN,You couldn't have been a fan of someone cool?
5,5,DEAN,Really? Gandhi?
5,5,DEAN,Ready to blow this joint?
5,5,SAM,"Dean, didn't it strike you as strange the way Gandhi just...vanished?"
5,5,DEAN,Strange how?
5,5,SAM,"No screaming, no big flame-out, I mean, that isn't the way ghosts usually go."
5,5,DEAN,"Still, I torched, he vanished."
5,5,SAM,"Yeah, but I—"
5,5,SAM,"Also, I feel like he was...trying to take a bite out of me."
5,5,DEAN,A bite?
5,5,SAM,"Yeah, like he was hungry. But the thing is, Gandhi—or, the real Gandhi—he was a—"
5,5,DEAN,A what?
5,5,DEAN,Spit it out.
5,5,SAM,He was a fruitarian.
5,5,DEAN,"Let me get this straight. Your, uh, ultimate hero was not only a short man in diapers, but he was also a fruitarian?"
5,5,SAM,That's not the point.
5,5,DEAN,"That is good. That is—even for you, that is good."
5,5,SAM,"Look, I'm just saying, I'm not so sure this thing is over."
5,5,DEAN,"It was a ghost. It was a weirdly super-charged fruitarian ghost, but it was still a ghost. Now let's go."
5,5,SAM,"So first you drag me into town, and now you're dragging me back out."
5,5,DEAN,"You ain't steering this boat. Let's go, chop chop."
5,5,SAM,"You know, this isn't gonna work."
5,5,DEAN,What isn't?
5,5,SAM,"Us. You, me, together, I—I thought it could, but it can't."
5,5,DEAN,"You're the one that wanted back in, chief."
5,5,SAM,And you're the one who called me back in.
5,5,DEAN,I still think we got some trust building to do.
5,5,SAM,How long am I gonna be on double-secret probation?
5,5,DEAN,Till I say so.
5,5,SAM,"Look. I know what I did. What I've done. And I am trying to climb out of that hole, I am, but you're not making it any easier."
5,5,DEAN,"So what am I supposed to do, just let you off the hook?"
5,5,SAM,"No. You can think whatever you want. I deserve it, and worse. Hell, you'll never punish me as much as I'm punishing myself, but the point is, if we're gonna be a team, you and I—it has to be a two-way street."
5,5,DEAN,So we just go back to the way we were before?
5,5,SAM,"No, because we were never that way before. Before didn't work."
5,5,SAM,How do you think we got here?
5,5,DEAN,What's that supposed to mean?
5,5,SAM,"Dean, one of the reasons I went off with Ruby...was to get away from you."
5,5,DEAN,What?
5,5,SAM,It made me feel strong. Like I wasn't your kid brother.
5,5,DEAN,Are you saying this is my fault?
5,5,SAM,"No, it's my fault. All I'm saying is that, if we're gonna do this, we have to do it different, we can't just fall into the same rut."
5,5,DEAN,What do you want me to do?
5,5,SAM,"You're gonna have to let me grow up, for starters."
5,5,DEAN,Yeah?
5,5,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, okay."
5,5,DEAN,I guess you were right about this not being over.
5,5,SAM,Sheriff Carnegie?
5,5,DEAN,"Sheriff, what happened?"
5,5,CARNEGIE,"I, uh, uh..."
5,5,CARNEGIE,I don't know!
5,5,DEAN,"Excuse us, girls. Hi, we're with the FBI."
5,5,SAM,Can you tell us what happened?
5,5,GIRL 1,It was horrible!
5,5,GIRL 2,Way horrible.
5,5,SAM,What was horrible?
5,5,GIRL 1,I thought she'd be nice!
5,5,GIRL 2,I still can't believe it.
5,5,DEAN,Believe what?
5,5,GIRL 2,She took Danielle!
5,5,DEAN,Who?
5,5,SAM,"It's okay, you're safe, just, tell us. Who took your friend?"
5,5,GIRL 2,It was...Paris Hilton.
5,5,SAM,Sorry?
5,5,GIRL 2,"She looked really good, though."
5,5,GIRL 1,Skinny!
5,5,GIRL 2,Skinny and fast.
5,5,GIRL 1,Mm.
5,5,DEAN,What—wait—huh?
5,5,SAM,"Uh, um...where did they go?"
5,5,GIRL 1,We don't know.
5,5,GIRL 2,They just vanished.
5,5,DEAN,Would you excuse us for just a minute?
5,5,DEAN,"Paris Hilton's not dead as far as we know, right?"
5,5,SAM,"Pretty sure, no."
5,5,DEAN,Which means it's not a—
5,5,SAM,Ghost. No.
5,5,DEAN,"So, what? Paris Hilton is a homicidal maniac—"
5,5,SAM,Or we missed something.
5,5,DEAN,What do you wanna do?
5,5,SAM,That's right.
5,5,SAM,What the hell?
5,5,SAM,I can't believe I missed it.
5,5,DEAN,Missed what?
5,5,SAM,Went back over the other two vics. There was blood loss. Major.
5,5,DEAN,"Oh, well, being a gory smear will do that to you."
5,5,SAM,"No, I—I mean more blood loss than a—a car crash or a head wound should cause, almost like it—"
5,5,DEAN,Something's feeding.
5,5,SAM,Yeah.
5,5,DEAN,Awesome.
5,5,SAM,And then—
5,5,SAM,There were these.
5,5,DEAN,"What are those, seeds?"
5,5,SAM,Yeah. They were in both vics' bellies.
5,5,DEAN,I hope you washed your hands.
5,5,SAM,"They're unlike any seed I've ever seen before, Dean."
5,5,DEAN,"Wow, just when I thought you couldn't get any geekier."
5,5,SAM,Yahtzee.
5,5,DEAN,What?
5,5,SAM,"The seeds aren't from around here. In fact, they're not from any tree or plant in the country."
5,5,DEAN,Where are they from?
5,5,SAM,"Eastern Europe. From a forest in the Balkans, which is not even there anymore. It was chopped down, like, thirty years ago."
5,5,DEAN,So?
5,5,SAM,"So, local legend has it that the forest was guarded by a pagan god whose name was Leshi. Um, a mischievous god, could take on infinite forms—"
5,5,DEAN,And let me guess. He liked to munch on his fans.
5,5,SAM,"Yep. Could be appeased only with the blood from his worshippers. It would drain 'em, then stuff their stomachs with the seeds."
5,5,DEAN,"So how's he doing it? What, he touches James Dean's keychain and then morphs into James Dean?"
5,5,SAM,Hm. It's as good a guess as any.
5,5,DEAN,"Yeah, well, whatever. How do we kill him?"
5,5,SAM,Says here to chop off his head with an iron axe.
5,5,DEAN,All right. Let's go gank ourselves a Paris Hilton.
5,5,SAM,Hey.
5,5,DEAN,She alive?
5,5,SAM,Yeah. Barely.
5,5,LESHI,Awesome.
5,5,LESHI,Oh. I'm so glad you're awake for this. This is gonna be huge.
5,5,DEAN,"Super. Yeah, I wouldn't wanna miss it."
5,5,LESHI,"I mean, I've been stuffing myself with fast food lately. So it's nice to do the ritual right. Prepare a nice, slow meal for a change."
5,5,SAM,"Just like the good old days, huh?"
5,5,LESHI,"You have no idea. People adored me. They used to throw themselves at me, with smiles on their faces."
5,5,DEAN,"Yeah, I guess these days nobody gives a flying crap about some backwoods forest god, huh?"
5,5,LESHI,No. Not since they cut down my forest and built a Yugo plant.
5,5,DEAN,"March of progress, sister."
5,5,LESHI,"For years now, I've been wandering. Hungry. Scared. Scrounging for scraps. So not sexy."
5,5,LESHI,"But then, the best thing ever happened."
5,5,LESHI,"Someone tripped the apocalypse. And I thought, what the hell, I'm tired of watching what I eat. I wanna pig out. So I found this little place. It's awesome. Adoring fans stroll right in the door."
5,5,SAM,Yeah. But they're not your fans.
5,5,LESHI,"So? They worship Lincoln, Gandhi, Hilton...whatever. I'll take what I can get."
5,5,DEAN,"You know, I gotta tell you, you are not the first god we've met, but you are...the nuttiest."
5,5,LESHI,"No, you, you people, you're the crazy ones. You used to worship gods. But this?"
5,5,LESHI,This is what passes for idolatry? Celebrities? What have they got besides small dogs and spray tans?
5,5,LESHI,"Maybe, but...there's still a lot of yummy meat on those bones, boy."
5,5,LESHI,"No. But I can totally read your mind, Dean. I know who your hero is. Your daddy. Am I right?"
5,5,LESHI,"And this belonged to him. Didn't it? Poor little Dean. All you ever wanted was to be loved by your idol. One distant father figure, coming right up."
5,5,DEAN,Not a word.
5,5,SAM,Dude. You just got whaled on by Paris Hilton!
5,5,DEAN,Shut up.
5,5,SAM,Glad she's okay.
5,5,DEAN,It gets better. Sheriff's putting out an APB on Paris Hilton.
5,5,DEAN,That oughta be good.
5,5,DEAN,"Hey, listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday. About me keeping too tight of a leash on you."
5,5,DEAN,"Hell, maybe you're right. I mean, look, I'm not exactly Mister Innocent in this whole mess either, you know. I did break the first seal."
5,5,SAM,You didn't know.
5,5,DEAN,"Yeah, well, neither did you."
5,5,DEAN,"I'm not saying demon blood was a great way to go, but, you did kill Lilith."
5,5,SAM,And start the apocalypse.
5,5,DEAN,"Which neither of us saw coming, I mean, who'd have thought killing Lilith would've been a bad thing?"
5,5,DEAN,"Point is, I was so worried about watching your every move that I didn't see what it was actually doing to you."
5,5,DEAN,"So, for that I'm sorry."
5,5,SAM,Thanks.
5,5,DEAN,So where do we go from here?
5,5,SAM,"They way I see it, we got one shot at surviving this."
5,5,DEAN,What's that?
5,5,SAM,"Maybe I am on deck for the devil, maybe same with you and Michael, maybe there's no changing that."
5,5,DEAN,Well that's encouraging.
5,5,DEAN,I can get on board with that.
5,5,SAM,Okay. But we're gonna have to do it on the same level.
5,5,DEAN,You got it.
5,5,DEAN,I say we get the hell outta here.
5,5,SAM,Hell yeah.
5,5,DEAN,Hey.
5,5,DEAN,You wanna drive?
5,5,SAM,You sure?
5,5,DEAN,"Yeah, I could, uh...I could use a nap."
5,6,DEAN,"You chose a demon over your own brother, and look what happened."
5,6,SAM,I'm sorry. I would give anything—
5,6,DEAN,I know you would.
5,6,SAM,It has to be a two-way street.
5,6,DEAN,I can get on board with that.
5,6,AMBER,Jimmy?
5,6,JIMMY,I can't. I'm dead.
5,6,AMBER,What is this—ketchup? Gross!
5,6,JIMMY,Ow! You're mean.
5,6,AMBER,"Yeah, that's what your parents pay me for—to be mean."
5,6,AMBER,Bed—now!
5,6,JIMMY,"Okay, okay. Just wait."
5,6,AMBER,Oh! Go!
5,6,JIMMY'S FATHER,"I'll, uh, take Amber home. Don't wait up."
5,6,JIMMY'S FATHER,Amber.
5,6,JIMMY'S FATHER,Amber.
5,6,JIMMY'S FATHER,Amber?
5,6,JIMMY'S FATHER,Francine!
5,6,DEAN,"Agents Page and Plant, FBI."
5,6,DOCTOR,Gentlemen. What brings you by?
5,6,SAM,We need to see Amber Freer's body.
5,6,DOCTOR,Really? What for?
5,6,DEAN,The police report said something clawed through her skull?
5,6,DOCTOR,You didn't read the autopsy report that I emailed out this morning?
5,6,SAM,"W-we had, uh, server issues."
5,6,DOCTOR,"When they brought her in, we thought she was attacked by a wolf or something."
5,6,DEAN,Or something.
5,6,DOCTOR,But we were wrong.
5,6,SAM,Is that a—
5,6,DOCTOR,It's a press-on nail. We found it in her temporal lobe.
5,6,SAM,Is that even possible?
5,6,DEAN,"Wait, are you—you saying that she did this to herself?"
5,6,DOCTOR,"Uh-huh. She scratched her brains out. It'd take hours, and it'd hurt like hell, but sure—it's possible."
5,6,DEAN,How?
5,6,DOCTOR,"Pick your acronym—OCD, PCP. It all spells crazy."
5,6,DOCTOR,"My guess, some kind of phantom itch. I mean, an extreme case, but..."
5,6,SAM,Phantom itch?
5,6,DOCTOR,Yup.
5,6,DOCTOR,"All it takes is someone talking about an itch—or thinking about one, even—and suddenly you can't stop scratching."
5,6,SAM,"Thanks, doc."
5,6,SAM,"Okay. Okay, now, some of these questions might seem a bit odd, but please just bear with me."
5,6,SAM,Have you noticed any cold spots in the house?
5,6,JIMMY'S FATHER,Uh...no.
5,6,SAM,"Okay, uh, what about strange smells?"
5,6,JIMMY,Whatcha lookin' for?
5,6,DEAN,Don't know yet.
5,6,DEAN,"It's, uh, Jimmy, right?"
5,6,DEAN,"So, Amber was your babysitter?"
5,6,JIMMY,"Yes, sir."
5,6,DEAN,"Yeah, most of my babysitters sucked."
5,6,DEAN,Especially Ms. Chancey. She only cared about two things.
5,6,DEAN,"Did you, uh, you see anything strange that night?"
5,6,JIMMY,"No, sir."
5,6,DEAN,You sure about that?
5,6,JIMMY,I—I would tell you if I knew something.
5,6,JIMMY,I promise. One hundred percent. Cross my heart.
5,6,DEAN,"Well, Jimmy, I, uh...I happen to know you're lying."
5,6,JIMMY,I'm not.
5,6,DEAN,"We gonna start talking truth, or are you and me gonna have to take a little trip downtown?"
5,6,DEAN,Kid said he put this on the babysitter's hairbrush.
5,6,SAM,"Dean, there's no way—"
5,6,SAM,—itching powder made that girl scratch her brains out. It's just ground-up maple seeds.
5,6,DEAN,"If you have any other theories, I'm open to 'em."
5,6,SAM,"Yeah? ...Yeah, we'll be right there."
5,6,SAM,What happened?
5,6,DOCTOR,Guy got electrocuted.
5,6,DEAN,Any idea how?
5,6,DOCTOR,"Eh, maybe a loose wire or a piece of equipment shorted out. So far, we haven't found anything."
5,6,SAM,Witnesses?
5,6,DOCTOR,"Yeah, guy in there—Mr. Stanley."
5,6,DOCTOR,"He says he saw it, but he's not making a lick of sense. Senile."
5,6,SAM,Thanks.
5,6,SAM,"Um, Mr. Stanley?"
5,6,STANLEY,It was just a joke. I didn't know it would really work.
5,6,DEAN,What would work?
5,6,STANLEY,All I did was shake his hand.
5,6,DEAN,You ready?
5,6,SAM,"Hit it, Mr. Wizard."
5,6,DEAN,"That'll do, pig."
5,6,SAM,What the hell?
5,6,SAM,That crap isn't supposed to work.
5,6,DEAN,This thing doesn't even have batteries.
5,6,SAM,"So...so, what? Are—are we looking at cursed objects?"
5,6,DEAN,Sounds good.
5,6,DEAN,Maybe there's a powerful witch in town.
5,6,DEAN,"Is there any link between the, uh, the joy buzzer and the itching powder?"
5,6,SAM,"Uh, one was made in China, the other Mexico, but they were both bought from the same store."
5,6,DEAN,Hmm.
5,6,DEAN,Sam!
5,6,OWNER,"Welcome to the Conjurarium, sanctum of magic and mystery."
5,6,SAM,You the owner?
5,6,OWNER,Yep.
5,6,DEAN,You sold any itching powder or joy buzzers lately?
5,6,OWNER,"Yeah, a grand total of one of each. They aren't exactly big-ticket items. Look, you boys here to buy something or what?"
5,6,SAM,"So, you get many customers?"
5,6,OWNER,"Kids come in. They don't buy much, but they're more than happy to break stuff. These days, all they care about are their iPhones and those kissing-vampire movies. The whole thing makes me just—"
5,6,DEAN,Angry?
5,6,OWNER,"Yeah. Yeah, I am angry. This shop has been my life for twenty years, and now it's wasting away to nothing."
5,6,DEAN,Which is why you hate them.
5,6,OWNER,I suppose.
5,6,DEAN,You wish there was something you could do about it.
5,6,OWNER,"Yeah, I guess I do."
5,6,DEAN,So you're taking revenge.
5,6,DEAN,With this.
5,6,OWNER,Oh! No!
5,6,SAM,"Yeah, something tells me this guy is not a powerful witch."
5,6,DEAN,Sorry. Sorry.
5,6,GIRL'S FATHER,"I'll just slip this tooth under your pillow, and while you're asleep, the tooth fairy will float down and swap it out for a quarter."
5,6,GIRL,"So some freak is gonna come in my room while I'm sleeping and take my tooth? Sounds scary. No, thank you."
5,6,GIRL'S FATHER,Come on.
5,6,GIRL'S FATHER,"Good night, sweetie."
5,6,TOOTH FAIRY,Shh! Hold still. You might feel just a little...pinch.
5,6,DEAN,"Well, I, uh, appreciate that, Nurse..."
5,6,DEAN,Fremont.
5,6,FREMONT,Please—call me Jen.
5,6,DEAN,Oh. Jen it is.
5,6,DEAN,What's up with Toothless? Cavity creeps get ahold of him?
5,6,SAM,Yeah. Close. He wrote up a description.
5,6,SAM,"Five foot ten, three hundred fifty pounds, wings, and a pink tutu. Said it was the tooth fairy."
5,6,DEAN,So he's obviously whacked out on painkillers.
5,6,SAM,Maybe. Whatever it was got past locked doors and windows without triggering the alarm.
5,6,DEAN,Come on. Tooth fairy?
5,6,SAM,And it left thirty-two quarters underneath his pillow. One for each tooth.
5,6,DEAN,"Well, I will see your crazy and raise you some. There's a couple of kids upstairs with stomach ulcers—say they got it from mixing Pop Rocks and Coke. Another guy...his face...froze that way."
5,6,SAM,What way?
5,6,DEAN,"He, uh, held it too long, and it—it stuck. They're flying in a plastic surgeon."
5,6,SAM,"So, I mean, if you add all that up..."
5,6,SAM,I got nothing.
5,6,DEAN,I thought sea-monkeys were real.
5,6,SAM,They are. They're brine shrimp.
5,6,DEAN,"No, no, no, I mean like in the ads. You know, like the sea-monkey wife cooks the pot roast for the sea-monkey husband, and the sea-monkey kids play with the dog in a sea-monkey castle—real. I mean, I was six, but I believed it."
5,6,SAM,Okay.
5,6,DEAN,Point is...
5,6,DEAN,"Maybe that's the connection. The tooth fairy, the Pop Rocks and Coke, the joy buzzer that shocks you—they're all lies that kids believe."
5,6,SAM,"And now they're coming true. Okay, so whatever's doing this is—is reshaping reality. It has the powers of a god. Or—"
5,6,SAM,—of a trickster.
5,6,DEAN,"Yeah, with the sense of humor of a nine-year-old."
5,6,SAM,Or you.
5,6,SAM,"Dude, seriously—still with the ham?"
5,6,DEAN,We don't have a fridge.
5,6,SAM,"Well, I found something."
5,6,SAM,"Um, tooth fairy attack was here, Pop Rocks and Coke was here, then you've got itching powder, face freeze, and joy buzzer—all located within a two-mile radius."
5,6,DEAN,"So, we got a blast zone of weird, and inside, fantasy becomes reality."
5,6,SAM,Looks like.
5,6,DEAN,And what's the A-bomb at its center?
5,6,SAM,Four acres of farmland...and a house.
5,6,DEAN,"Our motel isn't in that circle, by any chance?"
5,6,SAM,Yeah. Why?
5,6,SAM,"Ugh, dude—"
5,6,SAM,"That's not what I think it is, is it?"
5,6,DEAN,I got bored. That nurse was hot.
5,6,SAM,"You know you can go blind from that, too."
5,6,DEAN,Give me five minutes. We'll go check out that house.
5,6,SAM,"Hey, do not use my razor!"
5,6,JESSE,Can I help you?
5,6,SAM,"Hi. Uh, what's your name?"
5,6,JESSE,Who wants to know?
5,6,DEAN,"The, uh..."
5,6,DEAN,FBI.
5,6,JESSE,Let me see that.
5,6,JESSE,"So, what, you guys don't knock?"
5,6,DEAN,Are your parents home?
5,6,JESSE,They work.
5,6,SAM,"Well, you mind if we ask you a few questions, maybe take a look around the house?"
5,6,JESSE,I don't know.
5,6,DEAN,Come on. You can trust us. We're the authorities.
5,6,SAM,What's that?
5,6,JESSE,It's called soup.
5,6,JESSE,You heat it up and you eat it.
5,6,SAM,"Right. I, I know. It's just, um...I used to make my own dinner, too, when I was a kid."
5,6,JESSE,"Well, I'm not a kid."
5,6,SAM,"Right. No, I, I know. Um..."
5,6,SAM,"I'm Robert, by the way."
5,6,JESSE,Jesse.
5,6,SAM,"Jesse, nice to meet you."
5,6,DEAN,Did you draw this?
5,6,JESSE,It's the tooth fairy.
5,6,DEAN,"That's what you think the tooth fairy looks like, huh?"
5,6,JESSE,Yeah. My dad told me about him.
5,6,DEAN,Huh.
5,6,JESSE,"What, didn't your dad tell you about the tooth fairy?"
5,6,DEAN,My dad?
5,6,DEAN,My dad told me different stories.
5,6,JESSE,"Well, the tooth fairy isn't a story."
5,6,JESSE,"What do you know about itching powder, Jesse?"
5,6,JESSE,That stuff will make you scratch your brains out.
5,6,DEAN,Pop Rocks and Coke?
5,6,JESSE,"You mix them, and you'll end up in the hospital. Everyone knows that."
5,6,JESSE,You shouldn't have that.
5,6,DEAN,Why not?
5,6,JESSE,It can electrocute you.
5,6,DEAN,"Actually, it can't. It's just a wind-up toy. It's totally harmless. Doesn't even have batteries."
5,6,JESSE,So it can't shock you?
5,6,DEAN,Nope. Not at all. I swear.
5,6,JESSE,Oh. Okay.
5,6,DEAN,"I mean, all it does is just shake in your hand. It's kind of lame. See?"
5,6,DEAN,"What did you say your name was, again?"
5,6,SAM,"Dude, what the hell?"
5,6,DEAN,I had a hunch. I went with it.
5,6,SAM,You risked my ass on a hunch?
5,6,DEAN,You're fine.
5,6,SAM,"Besides, now we know who's turning this town into Willy Wonka's worst nightmare."
5,6,SAM,The kid.
5,6,DEAN,"Yeah. Everything Jesse believes comes true. He thinks the tooth fairy looks like Belushi, uh, joy buzzers really shock people, boom, that's what happens."
5,6,SAM,"Yeah, but convince him the joy buzzers don't actually work, and they go from killing machines back into crap toys."
5,6,DEAN,He probably doesn't even know he's doing it.
5,6,DEAN,How is he doing it?
5,6,SAM,"So, dug up what I could on Jesse Turner. It's not much. Uh, B student, won last year's Pinewood Derby. But get this. Jesse was adopted. His birth records are sealed."
5,6,DEAN,"So you unsealed them, and?"
5,6,SAM,"There's no father listed, but Jesse's biological mom is named Julia Wright. She lives in Elk Creek, on the other side of the state."
5,6,JULIA,"Whatever you're selling, I'm not interested."
5,6,DEAN,"We're not salesmen. Agents Page and Plant, FBI."
5,6,JULIA,"Put your badge in the slot. Your partner's, too."
5,6,JULIA,What do you want?
5,6,SAM,Um...
5,6,SAM,We just had a few questions. About your son.
5,6,JULIA,I don't have a son.
5,6,SAM,"He was born March twenty-ninth, nineteen ninety-eight, in Omaha."
5,6,SAM,You put him up for adoption?
5,6,JULIA,What about him?
5,6,SAM,"We were just wondering, um, was it...was it a normal pregnancy?"
5,6,DEAN,Was there anything strange?
5,6,JULIA,Stay away from me!
5,6,DEAN,"Mrs. Wright, wait!"
5,6,DEAN,We just want to talk!
5,6,JULIA,You're not demons?
5,6,DEAN,How do you know about demons?
5,6,JULIA,"I was possessed. A demon took control of my body, and I hurt people. I killed people."
5,6,SAM,"That, that wasn't you."
5,6,JULIA,But I was there. I heard a woman beg for mercy. I...felt a young girl's blood drip down my hands.
5,6,DEAN,That's how you knew about the salt.
5,6,JULIA,"Yeah, I picked up tricks. It was in my head for months."
5,6,DEAN,How many months?
5,6,JULIA,Nine.
5,6,SAM,So your son...
5,6,JULIA,"Yeah, the whole time. The pregnancy, birth—all of it. I was possessed."
5,6,JULIA,"The night the baby was born, I was alone. And the pain was—the pain was overwhelming. I, I screamed, and it came out a laugh, because the demon was happy. It used my body to give birth to a child. When it was over, something changed. Maybe the—the demon was tired or if the pain helped me fight it, but..."
5,6,JULIA,"Somehow, I took control."
5,6,JULIA,And the demon wailed inside me. It pounded against my skull. I thought my head was gonna explode. But I knew. I knew what I had to do.
5,6,JULIA,And when I was alone with the baby...
5,6,JULIA,A part of me...part of me wanted to kill it.
5,6,JULIA,"But, God help me, I couldn't do that. So, I put it up for adoption, and I ran."
5,6,DEAN,Who was the father?
5,6,JULIA,I was a virgin.
5,6,JULIA,Have you seen my son? Is he human?
5,6,DEAN,"His name's Jesse. He lives in, uh, Alliance. He's a good kid."
5,6,SAM,"So, now what?"
5,6,DEAN,We need help.
5,6,SAM,I take it you got our message.
5,6,CASTIEL,It's lucky you found the boy.
5,6,DEAN,"Oh, yeah, real lucky. What do we do with him?"
5,6,CASTIEL,Kill him.
5,6,DEAN,Cas.
5,6,CASTIEL,"This child is half demon and half human, but it's far more powerful than either. Other cultures call this hybrid cambion or katako. You know him as the antichrist."
5,6,CASTIEL,That wasn't me.
5,6,DEAN,Who put that there?
5,6,SAM,"Anyway, I don't get it. Jesse is the devil's son?"
5,6,CASTIEL,"No, of course not. Your Bible gets more wrong than it does right. The antichrist is not Lucifer's child. It's just demon spawn. But it is one of the devil's greatest weapons in the war against heaven."
5,6,DEAN,"Well, if Jesse's a demonic howitzer, then what the hell's he doing in Nebraska?"
5,6,CASTIEL,The demons lost him. They can't find him. But they're looking.
5,6,DEAN,And they lost him because?
5,6,CASTIEL,Because of the child's power. It hides him from both angels and demons. For now.
5,6,DEAN,"So he's got, like, a force field around him. Well, that's great. Problem solved."
5,6,CASTIEL,"With Lucifer risen, this child grows strong. Soon, he will do more than just make a few toys come to life—something that will draw the demons to him. The demons will find this child. Lucifer will twist this boy to his purpose. And then, with a word, this child will destroy the Host of Heaven."
5,6,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. You're saying that—that Jesse's gonna nuke the angels?"
5,6,CASTIEL,We cannot allow that to happen.
5,6,SAM,Wait.
5,6,SAM,We're the good guys. We—we don't just—kill children.
5,6,CASTIEL,"A year ago, you would have done whatever it took to win this war."
5,6,SAM,Things change.
5,6,DEAN,"Okay. Hey, look, we are not going to kill him. All right? But we can't leave Jesse here either. We know that. So...we take him to Bobby's. He'll know what to do."
5,6,CASTIEL,"You'll kidnap him? What is going on in this town, it's what happens when this thing is happy. You cannot imagine what it will do if it's angry. Besides, how will you hold him? With a thought, he could be halfway around the world."
5,6,DEAN,So we—
5,6,SAM,"So we tell him the truth. You say Jesse's destined to go dark side—fine. But he hasn't yet. So if we lay it all out for him—what he is, the apocalypse, everything—he might make the right choice."
5,6,CASTIEL,You didn't. And I can't take that chance.
5,6,SAM,Damn it.
5,6,JULIA,Oh. Sorry. I'm sorry.
5,6,MAILMAN,It's—it's no worries. You okay?
5,6,JULIA,Yeah. It's just today—a little...shaky.
5,6,MAILMAN,"Ah. Well, talking to the Winchesters will do that to you."
5,6,MAILMAN,"Don't you recognize me, sweetheart?"
5,6,DEMON,"We had some great times together, didn't we? And then you stole something from us, hid it away. That was very, very naughty of you. So we watched, and we waited. And now...they told you where he is, didn't they? I think it's time we go and visit our son."
5,6,CASTIEL,Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
5,6,JESSE,Mom! Dad!
5,6,CASTIEL,"Your mother and father are sleeping. I assure you, they won't wake until morning."
5,6,CASTIEL,I'm sorry.
5,6,DEAN,Was there a guy here? In a trench coat?
5,6,JESSE,Was he your friend?
5,6,DEAN,Him? No.
5,6,JESSE,I did that. But how did I do that?
5,6,DEAN,You're a superhero.
5,6,JESSE,I am?
5,6,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah. I mean, who else could turn someone into a toy? You're Superman—minus the cape and the go-go boots. See, my—my partner and I, we work for a secret government agency. It's our job to find kids with special powers. In fact, we're here to take you to a hidden base in South Dakota, where you'll be trained to fight evil."
5,6,JESSE,Like the X-Men?
5,6,DEAN,Exactly like the X-Men.
5,6,DEAN,"In fact, the, uh, guy we're taking you to—he's even in a wheelchair. You'll be a hero. You'll save lives. You'll get the girl. Sounds like fun, right?"
5,6,DEMON,They're lying to you.
5,6,DEMON,"Stay right there, dreamboat. Can't hurt you. Orders. You, on the other hand? Hurting you's encouraged."
5,6,DEAN,No! Uh!
5,6,JESSE,Leave him alone!
5,6,DEMON,Jesse. You're beautiful. You have your father's eyes.
5,6,JESSE,Who are you?
5,6,DEMON,I'm your mother.
5,6,JESSE,"No, you're not."
5,6,DEMON,Mm-hm. You're half human...half one of us.
5,6,DEAN,"She means demons, Jesse!"
5,6,DEMON,"Those people you call your parents—they lied to you, too. You're not theirs—not really."
5,6,JESSE,My mom and dad love me.
5,6,DEMON,"Do they? Is—is that why they leave you alone all day? Because they love you so much? These people—these imposters—they told you that the tooth fairy was real and that your toys could hurt you and a hundred other things that aren't true. They love you so much, they made your whole life a lie. Look into your heart, Jesse. You've always known you weren't theirs. You've always known you were different. Everyone has lied to you. They're not FBI agents. And you're not a superhero."
5,6,JESSE,Then what am I?
5,6,DEMON,You're powerful. You can have anything you want. You can do anything you want.
5,6,DEAN,"Don't listen to her, Jesse!"
5,6,DEMON,They treated you like a child. Nobody trusted you. Everybody's lied to you. Doesn't that make you angry?
5,6,DEMON,"See? It does make you angry. But I'm telling you the truth, Jesse."
5,6,DEMON,Wouldn't it be better if there were no lies? Come with me and you can wash it all clean. Start over. Imagine that—a world without lies.
5,6,SAM,She's right. We lied to you.
5,6,SAM,But I'll tell you the truth.
5,6,SAM,I just want...to tell...
5,6,JESSE,Stop it.
5,6,JESSE,I want to hear what he has to say.
5,6,DEMON,You're stronger than I thought.
5,6,SAM,"We lied to you. And I'm sorry. So here's the truth. I'm Sam Winchester. That's my brother, Dean. W-we hunt monsters."
5,6,DEMON,"Except when you are the monster. Right, Sammy?"
5,6,SAM,"And that woman right there, her name is Julia. She's your mother. But the thing inside of her, the thing that you're talking to—it's a demon."
5,6,JESSE,A demon?
5,6,DEMON,He's done nothing but lie to you since the moment you met him. Don't listen to him. Punish him.
5,6,JESSE,Sit down and shut up.
5,6,SAM,"There's, uh, kind of a...a war between angels and demons, and...you're a part of it."
5,6,JESSE,I'm just a kid.
5,6,SAM,You can go with her if you want. I can't stop you. No one can. But if you do...millions of people will die.
5,6,JESSE,She said I was half demon. Is that true?
5,6,SAM,"Yes. But you're half human, too. You can do the right thing. You've got choices, Jesse. But if you make the wrong ones, it'll haunt you for the rest of your life."
5,6,JESSE,Why are you telling me this?!
5,6,SAM,"Because I have to believe someone can make the right choice, even if I couldn't."
5,6,JESSE,Get out of her.
5,6,DEAN,How did you do that?
5,6,JESSE,I just did.
5,6,DEAN,Kid...you're awesome.
5,6,JESSE,Is she gonna be all right?
5,6,DEAN,Eventually.
5,6,DEAN,"Look, uh, truth is, he's kind of a buddy of mine. Is there any way you could turn him back?"
5,6,JESSE,He tried to kill me.
5,6,DEAN,Right. Uh. But he's a—he's a good guy. He was just confused.
5,6,DEAN,Okay. It's been a long night. We'll...talk about it later.
5,6,JESSE,What now?
5,6,DEAN,"Now we take you someplace safe, get you trained up. You'd be handy in a fight, kid."
5,6,JESSE,What if I don't want to fight?
5,6,SAM,Jesse.
5,6,SAM,You're powerful. More powerful than...pretty much anything we've ever seen. That makes you—
5,6,JESSE,A freak.
5,6,SAM,"To some people, maybe. But not to us. See, we're kind of freaks ourselves."
5,6,JESSE,"I can't stay here, can I?"
5,6,DEAN,"No. The demons know where you are, and more will be coming."
5,6,JESSE,I won't go without my mom and dad.
5,6,SAM,"There's nothing more important than family. We get that. And if you really want to take them with you, we'll back your play. But you got to understand—it's gonna be dangerous for them, too."
5,6,JESSE,What do you mean?
5,6,DEAN,Our dad...he would take us with him wherever he went.
5,6,JESSE,Where is he now?
5,6,SAM,Dead. A demon killed him.
5,6,DEAN,"Look, Jesse...once you're in this fight..."
5,6,DEAN,"You're in it till the end, win or lose."
5,6,JESSE,What should I do?
5,6,SAM,We can't tell you. It's your choice. It's not fair. I know.
5,6,JESSE,"Can I go see my parents? I, I need to...say goodbye."
5,6,DEAN,Sure.
5,6,DEAN,He's been up there a long time.
5,6,CASTIEL,He's gone.
5,6,SAM,Where?
5,6,CASTIEL,I don't know. Jesse put everyone in town back to normal—the ones still alive. Then he vanished.
5,6,SAM,Hey.
5,6,DEAN,What does it say?
5,6,SAM,"That he had to leave to keep his parents safe, that he loves them, and he's sorry."
5,6,DEAN,How do we find him?
5,6,CASTIEL,"With the boy's powers, we can't. Not unless he wants to be found."
5,6,DEAN,You think Jesse's gonna be okay?
5,6,SAM,I hope so.
5,6,DEAN,"You know, we destroyed that kid's life by telling him the truth."
5,6,SAM,"We didn't have a choice, Dean."
5,6,DEAN,"Yeah. You know, I'm starting to get why parents lie to their kids. You want them to believe that the worst thing out there is mixing Pop Rocks and Coke—protect them from the real evil. You want them going to bed feeling safe. If that means lying to them, so be it. The more I think about it...the more I wish Dad had lied to us."
5,6,SAM,"Yeah, me too."
5,7,MRS. XAVIER,"Hey, babe."
5,7,MRS. XAVIER,"Nice to see you, too."
5,7,MRS. XAVIER,Honey?
5,7,MRS. XAVIER,Are you okay?
5,7,DOCTOR,You expect me to believe you're CDC?
5,7,SAM,Excuse me?
5,7,DOCTOR,It's just that you're a day early. First time in history I haven't sat on my ass waiting for you people.
5,7,DEAN,New administration. A change you can believe in.
5,7,DOCTOR,Right.
5,7,DOCTOR,"Meet Xavier. Date of birth, April third, nineteen eighty-four."
5,7,DOCTOR,I know. I ran the DNA twice. That's definitely him.
5,7,DEAN,"Well, he wasn't big on the sunscreen, huh?"
5,7,SAM,"So, what's your theory?"
5,7,DOCTOR,"All I know is, decedent's male, twenty-five years old—"
5,7,DOCTOR,—and he died of old age.
5,7,DEAN,You were right about this one. It's definitely a job.
5,7,BOBBY,Thought so. Any other stiffs in town?
5,7,DEAN,Just the one body.
5,7,BOBBY,Anything else?
5,7,DEAN,"Couple missing persons, but usual for a town this size."
5,7,BOBBY,"Well, check 'em out."
5,7,DEAN,You think they're connected?
5,7,BOBBY,Call it a hunch.
5,7,DEAN,"You got it. And, by the way, how you doing?"
5,7,BOBBY,Doing?
5,7,DEAN,"Yeah. You know, just...in general?"
5,7,BOBBY,"Oh, you mean my legs. Well, I'm just weepin' in my Haagen-Dazs. Idjit."
5,7,MRS. WHITLOW,That's the most recent.
5,7,SAM,How long has he been missing?
5,7,MRS. WHITLOW,"Oh, I knew right away when he didn't come home Tuesday night."
5,7,DEAN,"Is there someplace he likes to go after work, maybe? A favorite bar?"
5,7,MRS. WHITLOW,"No. Tuesdays, he always works a bit late, but he always comes straight home."
5,7,DEAN,"May I use your facilities, ma'am?"
5,7,DEAN,'Working late' my ass.
5,7,SAM,"Well, at least he's consistent. Same room every Tuesday, hourly rates."
5,7,DEAN,Hope I got that kind of kick when I'm his age.
5,7,SAM,"Yeah, like either of us will live that long."
5,7,DEAN,True.
5,7,SAM,So...what do you think's in there?
5,7,DEAN,"A wrinkly, gooey corpse."
5,7,MAN,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh! Oh, God!"
5,7,MAN,Hey! What the—
5,7,SAM,Oh.
5,7,DEAN,God.
5,7,SAM,It's gooey.
5,7,DEAN,"Sorry. Uh, got the wrong room."
5,7,MAN,Close the door!
5,7,SAM,Hey.
5,7,SAM,Nice tattoo.
5,7,SAM,Happen to know anybody named Cliff Whitlow?
5,7,MAN,Never heard of him.
5,7,SAM,"Well, that's weird."
5,7,SAM,'Cause you're carrying his wallet.
5,7,DEAN,Huh.
5,7,DEAN,"Your wife told us about your, uh, birthmark there. That's nice. Well, you look great. Cliff. Did you get some work done?"
5,7,CLIFF,Could you give us some privacy?
5,7,CLIFF,Please don't tell my wife.
5,7,DEAN,Slow down.
5,7,CLIFF,"I'm begging you. As far as she knows, I'm dead. For the love of God, let's keep it that way."
5,7,DEAN,How can you possibly be Cliff Whitlow?
5,7,CLIFF,I can't tell you.
5,7,DEAN,"Well, either you tell us or we tell the missus."
5,7,CLIFF,Okay! Okay! It was a game.
5,7,SAM,Like...XBox?
5,7,CLIFF,"What's XBox? No. Poker. High stakes. Instead of cash, you play for years."
5,7,DEAN,What is that supposed to mean?
5,7,CLIFF,"Look, I know it sounds crazy. Guy comes up to me at a bar, invites me to play. Gives me twenty-five of these weirdo poker chips, right? Chants some mumbo humbo over them, says now they're twenty-five years. I'm laughing, but then I come out up. And look at me."
5,7,SAM,What was he chanting?
5,7,CLIFF,"How should I know? All I know is, my bad hip's good, I threw away my glasses. One of those ladies was here for free! Man's some kind of miracle worker."
5,7,DEAN,What does this miracle worker look like?
5,7,CLIFF,"Just a guy. Maybe thirty-five, brown hair. Irish accent. His name was Patrick."
5,7,DEAN,"All right, all right. Where's this game at?"
5,7,CLIFF,He said he likes to keep moving. Never stays in one bar long. And he finds you.
5,7,DEAN,"Thank you, Cliff."
5,7,DEAN,"Oh, and, uh...stay classy."
5,7,DEAN,"It sounds crazy, right?"
5,7,BOBBY,"No. There's lore on it. Goes back centuries. Traveling card player pops into town. You beat him, you get your best years back. 'Course, most folks lose."
5,7,DEAN,"Well, that would explain the crunchy corpse."
5,7,BOBBY,"Supposedly, this player's a hell of a card shark. Got a lot of years in the bank. You find the bar he's working in yet?"
5,7,DEAN,There's a lot of dives in this town. We're gonna have to split up.
5,7,BOBBY,"Well, why you still talking to me?"
5,7,SAM,Find anything?
5,7,DEAN,"Yeah, a whole bunch of squat. You?"
5,7,SAM,"No, not a thing."
5,7,DEAN,"All right. Well, you come up dry, circle back to the motel in two. Your turn to grab dinner."
5,7,SAM,Usual?
5,7,DEAN,Extra bacon.
5,7,DEAN,Can I get a beer?
5,7,BARTENDER,Yep.
5,7,DEAN,"You wouldn't happen to know of a poker game going on in back, would you?"
5,7,BARTENDER,"It's a bar, not a casino."
5,7,DEAN,My friend Ben told me you'd know.
5,7,BARTENDER,Don't know any Ben.
5,7,DEAN,"Sure you do. You know, balding, smart-ass, real ladies' man?"
5,7,BARTENDER,"Listen, pal, I told you, I don't know any Ben. I don't know nothing about a game."
5,7,DEAN,"You sure? 'Cause, uh..."
5,7,DEAN,He sure seems to know you.
5,7,BARTENDER (voiceover),'Round back. Take the elevator down.
5,7,DEAN,Bobby? What the hell are you doing here?
5,7,BOBBY,Planting daisies. What's it look like? Came in on the case.
5,7,DEAN,And you beat me here?
5,7,DEAN,"Well, brains trumps legs, apparently."
5,7,DEAN,"So, you found the game?"
5,7,BOBBY,Yep.
5,7,DEAN,Did you stop it?
5,7,DEAN,Bobby?
5,7,BOBBY,Not exactly.
5,7,DEAN,What did you do?
5,7,BOBBY,"I played, okay?"
5,7,DEAN,And?
5,7,BOBBY,I lost.
5,7,DEAN,Are you kidding me? You played some—some he-witch?
5,7,BOBBY,Don't you take that tone with me.
5,7,DEAN,You idiot!
5,7,BOBBY,They're my years! I can do what I want!
5,7,DEAN,How many did you lose?
5,7,BOBBY,Twenty-five.
5,7,DEAN,We're not done.
5,7,OLDER MAN,"So, you're saying that you're a mind reader."
5,7,PATRICK,"Ah, come on. No such thing. But I can read people. Take your lovely companion here."
5,7,PATRICK,"I'd say, judging from her exquisite posture, she used to be a dancer."
5,7,PATRICK,Not much of a drinker. Very independent. Looking for adventure.
5,7,DEAN,"Hey, man. Excuse me. Can I borrow you for a sec?"
5,7,PATRICK,"Oh, yeah. Of course. Great. Good to see you."
5,7,PATRICK,Would you two please excuse me?
5,7,DEAN,Sorry to cut you short with Mr. and Mrs. Easy Marks over there.
5,7,PATRICK,"Oh, no big."
5,7,PATRICK,Wasn't a total loss.
5,7,PATRICK,"Look, I don't know what it is you think I did to your wife or girlfriend—"
5,7,PATRICK,"—mother or sister, but, uh, I just want you to know, my feelings were real."
5,7,DEAN,"That ain't my problem, man-witch. You owe my friend some years."
5,7,PATRICK,"Oh, that's what this is. I'm sorry. He lost. Them's the breaks."
5,7,DEAN,"Well, then un-lose him."
5,7,PATRICK,"Oh, go ahead and shoot me, if it makes you feel better. Besides, I could use a good...you know...tickle. You want years? Great. Play me for 'em."
5,7,DEAN,Fine.
5,7,BOBBY,"Dean, no!"
5,7,DEAN,They're my years. I can do what I want.
5,7,PATRICK,Lozenge?
5,7,PATRICK,"What? It's barely linty. Okay, well, suit yourself. Just trying to help."
5,7,DEAN,"All right, all right. Come on. Let's do this."
5,7,PATRICK,You understand the terms?
5,7,PATRICK,Buy-in's twenty-five years.
5,7,DEAN,Make it fifty.
5,7,PATRICK,I like the cut of your jib.
5,7,PATRICK,Lannraich gu dealrach a-nis.
5,7,DEAN,Twenty-five. That's twenty-five years. They go to him.
5,7,DEAN,And he's cashing out.
5,7,BOBBY,Dean!
5,7,DEAN,Bobby.
5,7,PATRICK,You sure?
5,7,DEAN,Yes.
5,7,PATRICK,Las suas agus cuir ás an teine. Mar sin bitheadh.
5,7,PATRICK,That's twenty-five years you just pissed away. Better be sure you can win them back.
5,7,DEAN,Shuffle up and deal.
5,7,PATRICK,This is gonna be fun.
5,7,SAM,"Hey, Dean? You find anything?"
5,7,OLD MAN,"Uh, you might say."
5,7,SAM,Who the hell are you!
5,7,OLD MAN,"Dude, relax. It's me."
5,7,SAM,Dean?
5,7,DEAN,Hi.
5,7,SAM,What the hell happened?
5,7,DEAN,"I, you know...found the game."
5,7,SAM,You f—I thought you said you were g-good at poker.
5,7,DEAN,"I am. Shut up. So, you were just gonna shoot some old guy? Is that it?"
5,7,SAM,"I didn't know what you were. I mean, have you seen you? You look like—"
5,7,SAM,I was gonna say Emperor Palpatine.
5,7,BOBBY,I see you met John McCain there.
5,7,SAM,Yeah. Either of you want to tell me what happened?
5,7,DEAN,Bobby's an idiot. That's what happened.
5,7,BOBBY,"Hey, nobody asked you to play."
5,7,DEAN,Right. I should have just let you die.
5,7,BOBBY,"And for damn sure, nobody asked you to lose!"
5,7,DEAN,What the hell were you thinking? He's a witch. He's been playing poker since guys wore tights.
5,7,BOBBY,You just don't get it.
5,7,DEAN,"Yeah, I get it, Bobby. You saw a chance to turn the hands of the clock back and get out of that damn chair. Pretty tempting. I can imagine."
5,7,BOBBY,"No, you can't."
5,7,DEAN,"You got me. I never been paralyzed. But I tell you something—I've been to hell, and there's an archangel there wanting me to drop the soap. Look at me! My junk's rustier than yours! You hear me bellyaching? Huh?"
5,7,SAM,"Uh, actually, yeah."
5,7,DEAN,Oh!
5,7,DEAN,I'm having a heart attack.
5,7,BOBBY,"No, you're not."
5,7,DEAN,What is it?
5,7,BOBBY,Acid reflux. Guys your age can't digest certain foods. You're gonna need to put down that cheeseburger.
5,7,BOBBY,"So, you want to keep emoting, or you want to talk about solving this little issue of yours? It's got to be about the chips."
5,7,DEAN,"I slid 'em across, Patrick did his little witchy number, and you prettied up in a hurry."
5,7,SAM,"I mean, what are you all thinking? Some kind of magic chips or something?"
5,7,BOBBY,Definitely.
5,7,DEAN,You remember what he chanted?
5,7,BOBBY,Yep—every word.
5,7,SAM,"All right, then let's find out where he stashes his chips."
5,7,DEAN,And steal me fifty. Benjamin Button me back into burger shape. What do you think?
5,7,BOBBY,I think you ought to put some clothes on.
5,7,MAID,"Ready for housekeeping, sir?"
5,7,DEAN,Born ready.
5,7,MAID,You're just like my grandfather.
5,7,MAID,"He hits on anything that moves, too."
5,7,MAID,You're adorable.
5,7,DEAN,And dangerous.
5,7,MAID,Aw.
5,7,DEAN,Can we just go?
5,7,DRIVER,"Guys, get some help! He came out of nowhere! Right out in front of me!"
5,7,DEAN,"I got to say, I kind of like the guy."
5,7,BOBBY,"Well, I'm out."
5,7,SAM,Dean.
5,7,DEAN,Sam?
5,7,DEAN,Dime-store model. Piece of cake.
5,7,DEAN,I could have done that.
5,7,LIA,What are you doing?
5,7,DEAN,Aren't you the chick from the bar?
5,7,LIA,I'm a lot more than that.
5,7,PATRICK,"It's all right, sweetheart. It's all right. They're harmless."
5,7,PATRICK,"You boys want chips? Take 'em. They're just chips, Einsteins. It's showmanship. This may come as a shock, but the magic does not lie in a pile of crappy plywood or in any phony abracadabra. It's in the nine-hundred-year-old witch. You boys want years? Score 'em the old-fashioned way. Texas hold 'em."
5,7,DEAN,Fine. Let's do it.
5,7,PATRICK,What card am I holding up?
5,7,PATRICK,"That's what I thought. If your eyesight's that bad, what about your memory? I'm not a murderer. You, on the other hand..."
5,7,DEAN,"No, Sam."
5,7,SAM,Dean.
5,7,PATRICK,"What, Sam not much of a player? Okay, well, happy trails, Dean. Enjoy the twilight of your life. Should have taken better care of that ticker, though."
5,7,PATRICK,You're free to go.
5,7,PATRICK,"Oh, but, Sam..."
5,7,PATRICK,"Your brother's situation—that's punishment enough, but I can't let you leave without a small parting gift."
5,7,SAM,What are you doing?
5,7,PATRICK,You'll find out soon enough.
5,7,DEAN,"Let's get out of here, Sam."
5,7,DEAN,Dude...
5,7,DEAN,I believe that he-witch gave you the clap.
5,7,BOBBY,Little help here?
5,7,SAM,"You know, I still think I should play."
5,7,DEAN,"No, no, no. You're not good enough. I'm better. Bobby's way better. We both lost."
5,7,BOBBY,Exactly.
5,7,SAM,"So, what? So I don't get a say in this anymore?"
5,7,DEAN,"Sammy, when you get to be our age—"
5,7,SAM,"You're thirty, Dean! Look, I've watched you hustle plenty of poker—"
5,7,BOBBY,"Knowing the game is not enough, Sam. It's not about playing the cards."
5,7,SAM,It's about playing the other guy. I know that.
5,7,BOBBY,"Well, hooray for you. All I'm saying is, I played this guy. I know his style. I can take him."
5,7,DEAN,"No, Bobby. You don't have enough years in the bank."
5,7,BOBBY,I got enough.
5,7,SAM,"No, you'll die if you lose, Bobby."
5,7,BOBBY,"So what if I do, huh? What exactly am I living for, huh? The damn apocalypse? Watching men die bloody while I sit in this chair, can't take a step to help 'em?"
5,7,DEAN,Bobby—
5,7,BOBBY,"No, no. It's the facts. I'm old...and broke down...and I can't..."
5,7,BOBBY,"I ain't a hunter no more. I'm useless. And if I wasn't such a coward, I'd have stuck a gun in my mouth day I got home from the hospital."
5,7,SAM,"Bobby, you are not playing again. I'm not letting you do that. There's another way out of this. There's got to be. And I'm gonna find it."
5,7,LIA,Take it. It'll help you.
5,7,BOBBY,What is this?
5,7,LIA,The most powerful reversal spell you've ever laid your eyes on.
5,7,DEAN,And it reverses what?
5,7,LIA,Patrick's work—all of it.
5,7,DEAN,You—you saying I could be normal again?
5,7,LIA,You and everyone else he's ever played.
5,7,LIA,Who's still alive.
5,7,DEAN,Why the hell should we trust you?
5,7,LIA,"Trust me, don't trust me. I don't care. The spell is real."
5,7,BOBBY,"If it zaps everyone, don't that include your man?"
5,7,LIA,"And me, too. I look good for my age."
5,7,BOBBY,"Lady, this don't add up for squat. Why would you want that?"
5,7,LIA,I have my reasons.
5,7,LIA,Do it quick. We leave town tomorrow.
5,7,HESH,Bet.
5,7,PATRICK,"I sense you've got me by the jewels on this one, Hesh. I fold."
5,7,PATRICK,"What are you up—like thirteen years there, Hesh? What do you say we call it a day?"
5,7,HESH,"Thanks, Patrick."
5,7,PATRICK,"Hesh here is gonna live to see his granddaughter's bat mitzvah. Isn't that right, Hesh?"
5,7,HESH,"Thanks again, Patrick."
5,7,PATRICK,"Shalom, my friend. Shalom."
5,7,SAM,That was nice of you.
5,7,PATRICK,I'm a nice guy. What can I do you for?
5,7,SAM,Deal.
5,7,DEAN,Jawbone of a murderer. Great.
5,7,DEAN,"You know, this really sucks. How do we even know her spell's gonna work?"
5,7,BOBBY,"We don't. But we ain't got a Plan B. Now, less flappin' and more diggin'."
5,7,DEAN,"Oh, God!"
5,7,DEAN,My elbows! I'm all creaky.
5,7,BOBBY,"Hurry up, you crybaby."
5,7,DEAN,"Pound it up your ass, Ironsides."
5,7,BOBBY,One little grave.
5,7,DEAN,Then you do it.
5,7,BOBBY,Fine. I'll hop right in.
5,7,DEAN,"Well, least your legs are numb."
5,7,BOBBY,"Shut up and dig, Grandma."
5,7,DEAN,Oh! Now it's my back!
5,7,BOBBY,Can you straighten up?
5,7,DEAN,"Yeah, but a little sympathy wouldn't hurt."
5,7,BOBBY,Butt cheek tingling?
5,7,DEAN,"Well, that's kind of personal."
5,7,BOBBY,So yeah?
5,7,BOBBY,It's sciatica. You'll live. Keep digging.
5,7,DEAN,"You know, Bobby, killing you is officially on my bucket list."
5,7,PATRICK,"I like you, Sam. I do. You're smart, and your heart's clearly in the right place."
5,7,PATRICK,I can tell a lot about a guy by looking.
5,7,SAM,You mean you're psychic.
5,7,PATRICK,No. That'd be cheating. I'm talking about good old-fashioned intuition.
5,7,SAM,Right. Let's just play.
5,7,PATRICK,We are playing.
5,7,PATRICK,Does your big brother know you're here?
5,7,SAM,Bet five.
5,7,PATRICK,Didn't think so.
5,7,PATRICK,"I raise. Here you are, right? Trying to clean up their mess, and they still want to sit you at the kiddie table."
5,7,PATRICK,"You're not the little brother anymore, Sam."
5,7,PATRICK,"Then again, maybe you are. You're in over your head here, Sam. I mean, you can keep making these moves—you know, playing it cautious, playing the percentages. But I'm still gonna kick your ass into the nursing home."
5,7,SAM,Does this armchair-psychology routine usually work for you?
5,7,PATRICK,You tell me. You're the one who's losing.
5,7,PATRICK,Little break?
5,7,DEAN,How's it going in there?
5,7,SAM,How do you think it's going? What about you? You have everything you need?
5,7,DEAN,We still need a little he-witch DNA.
5,7,SAM,He was chewing it.
5,7,SAM,"Hurry up, Dean. Please."
5,7,DEAN,"All right. Just keep him busy. And, Sammy...don't lose."
5,7,BOBBY (voiceover),"Airmidh mi air maponus, dia—"
5,7,BOBBY,"—na hogalachd. Gairmidh mi air sucellus, dia na time."
5,7,BOBBY,Till an-dràsda obair uile gu bheilair a bhith deànta. Mar sin bitheadh. Drop it in.
5,7,DEAN,Well? How do I look?
5,7,PATRICK.,Question.
5,7,PATRICK,Is this what you meant to give your big brother?
5,7,PATRICK,The one you gave him never passed my lips. Won't do a scrap of good.
5,7,PATRICK,"I don't like cheating, Sam."
5,7,LIA,Stop it!
5,7,LIA,"Patrick, let him go!"
5,7,PATRICK,He tried to kill us!
5,7,LIA,I did it! I gave him the spell!
5,7,PATRICK,What?
5,7,PATRICK,Why...why would you do that?
5,7,LIA,You know why.
5,7,LIA,You know.
5,7,PATRICK,Keep. Playing.
5,7,BOBBY,Everything we put in that spell was kosher.
5,7,DEAN,"Yeah, everything except the damn toothpick."
5,7,BOBBY,You got to go get a speck of DNA. Strap on your track shoes.
5,7,DEAN,"Oh, goody. More stairs."
5,7,DEAN,It's too damn clean in here. First witch I ever heard of didn't spew bodily fluids all over the place.
5,7,BOBBY,"Toothbrush, comb—anything."
5,7,PATRICK,"Well, look at you—the percentage player betting the farm. Awful transparent of you, Sam. I mean, if I had a monster hand like you have, I'd trap you. But you get so excited, you bet yourself right out of a big pot."
5,7,PATRICK,I fold.
5,7,PATRICK,"Set of ladies, I'm guessing."
5,7,PATRICK,"Nice bluff. If we had time, I could make a real player out of you."
5,7,SAM,I got time.
5,7,PATRICK,Maybe. But I can't say the same for Dean. Your brother's gonna be dead soon.
5,7,PATRICK,And when I say 'soon'...
5,7,PATRICK,I mean minutes.
5,7,PATRICK,The game's not over till I say it is. Blinds.
5,7,DEAN,Sam...
5,7,PATRICK,So.
5,7,PATRICK,"When it's about your brother, you get so emotional, your brain just flies right out the window."
5,7,PATRICK,Good to know.
5,7,SAM,Go to hell.
5,7,SAM,I'm all in.
5,7,PATRICK,"Don't do that, Sam."
5,7,SAM,"I can't leave until it's over? Fine. It's over. Now, where's my brother?"
5,7,PATRICK,"Look, there's poker and then there's suicide."
5,7,SAM,Just play the hand.
5,7,BOBBY,"Dean? Dean, you there?"
5,7,PATRICK,Fine.
5,7,BOBBY,Dean?!
5,7,PATRICK,"I'm sorry, kid. Aces full."
5,7,SAM,You're crying.
5,7,SAM,"For a witch, you're so nice, it's actually kind of creepy. It's okay."
5,7,SAM,It was a great hand.
5,7,SAM,Just—
5,7,SAM,—not as great as—
5,7,SAM,—as four fours.
5,7,PATRICK,"Well played. You know, that whole...going-out-of-your-head bit—very method."
5,7,PATRICK,"Well, there's more to you than meets the eye."
5,7,SAM,"Cash these in for Dean, please."
5,7,PATRICK,With pleasure.
5,7,BOBBY,"Dean, you hear me? Damn it, Dean!"
5,7,BOBBY,Idjit.
5,7,PATRICK,"I can't do this, Lia."
5,7,LIA,"Yes, you can."
5,7,PATRICK,Don't make me. I don't want to win.
5,7,LIA,I buried my daughter.
5,7,LIA,And she looked like this.
5,7,LIA,It's not natural.
5,7,PATRICK,You knew. When you decided to come with me.
5,7,PATRICK,This is what you wanted. You're still young. You're so beautiful. You have me.
5,7,LIA,"I miss my family. I'm sorry, Patrick."
5,7,PATRICK,I thought you loved me.
5,7,LIA,"I do. Sweetheart, of course I do. I thought I was cut out for this, but I'm not."
5,7,PATRICK,I don't think I can do this without you.
5,7,LIA,You got on okay for a long time before you met me.
5,7,PATRICK,Check.
5,7,LIA,All in.
5,7,PATRICK,All in.
5,7,LIA,Thank you.
5,7,BOBBY,No tricks—you actually beat the guy?
5,7,BOBBY,How the hell?
5,7,SAM,Just lucky.
5,7,SAM,Hey. I'll see y'all guys later.
5,7,DEAN,Where you going?
5,7,SAM,"Uh...mm, nowhere."
5,7,SAM,A booster shot. Don't say it.
5,7,BOBBY,"Well, I guess we can get the van loaded."
5,7,DEAN,I shouldn't have called you an idiot.
5,7,BOBBY,Which time?
5,7,DEAN,"I'm sorry. I mean, I actually—I, I—I get it. Getting old ain't a bachelor party. And dealing with the crap you got to deal with—"
5,7,BOBBY,Don't you go on pity patrol.
5,7,DEAN,"I'm not. I'm not. I'm just...I'm saying, you know, if I was in your shoes..."
5,7,BOBBY,You'd never stop complaining.
5,7,DEAN,"Fair enough. You're not useless, Bobby."
5,7,BOBBY,Okay. Good talk.
5,7,DEAN,"No, wait a minute. Listen to me."
5,7,DEAN,"You don't stop being a soldier 'cause you got wounded in battle. Okay? No matter what shape you're in, bottom line is, you're family. I don't know if you've noticed, but me and Sam, we don't have much left. I can't do this without you. I can't. So don't you dare think about checking out. I don't want to hear that again."
5,7,BOBBY,Okay.
5,7,DEAN,Okay. Good.
5,7,BOBBY,"Thanks. Now, we done feeling our feelings? 'Cause I'd like to get out of this room before we both start growing lady parts."
5,7,DEAN,"Yeah, we're done."
5,7,DEAN,"Let's go, Ironsides."
5,7,BOBBY,"Oh, that one's sticking, huh?"
5,8,DEAN,You sons of bitches jumpstarted Judgment Day!
5,8,ZACHARIAH,It's Apocalypse Now.
5,8,CASTIEL,Raphael. Where is he?
5,8,RAPHAEL,"God? He's dead, Castiel."
5,8,SAM,Lucifer.
5,8,LUCIFER,"You're the one, Sam. You're my true vessel."
5,8,SAM,That'll never happen.
5,8,ZACHARIAH,You're the Michael sword.
5,8,DEAN,"What do you mean, I'm the sword?"
5,8,ZACHARIAH,You're Michael's weapon.
5,8,DEAN,I'm a vessel?
5,8,DEAN,So what is it? Spirit? Demon?
5,8,BOBBY,More like demigods.
5,8,BOBBY,—usually with a sense of humor. Deadly pranks.
5,8,DEAN,"Okay, another thing Bobby mentioned was—"
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Sam, there's a lesson here."
5,8,SAM,What lesson?
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Dean's your weakness. The bad guys know it, too. It's gonna be the death of you, Sam."
5,8,DEAN,I'm gonna need a bigger mouth.
5,8,DEAN,"Hey there, Sam. What's happening?"
5,8,SAM,"Oh, nothing. Um. Just the end of the world."
5,8,SAM,You're gonna need a bigger mouth.
5,8,SAM,"Hey, uh, have you done your research yet?"
5,8,DEAN,"Oh, yeah. All kinds of research. All night."
5,8,SAM,Yeah? Hm.
5,8,WOMAN,"Oh, Dean..."
5,8,DEAN,We have some more research to do.
5,8,SAM,Dean...
5,8,DEAN,Son of a bitch!
5,8,INTERCOM,All on-duty interns please report to station five south. All on-duty interns please report to station five south.
5,8,SAM,What are you watching?
5,8,SAM,When did you hit menopause?
5,8,DEAN,It's called channel surfing.
5,8,DEAN,You ready?
5,8,SAM,Are you?
5,8,OFFICER,"One more time, the FBI is here why, exactly?"
5,8,DEAN,Might have something to do with one of your locals getting his head ripped off.
5,8,OFFICER,Bill Randolph died from a bear attack.
5,8,SAM,How sure are you—
5,8,SAM,—that it was a bear?
5,8,OFFICER,What else would it be?
5,8,DEAN,"Well, whatever it was—"
5,8,DEAN,"—it chased Mr. Randolph through the woods, smashed through his front door—"
5,8,DEAN,"—followed him up the stairs, and killed him in his bedroom."
5,8,DEAN,"Is that common, a bear doing all that?"
5,8,OFFICER,"Depends how pissed off it is, I guess. Look, the Randolphs live way up in high country. You got trout runs to make a grown man weep."
5,8,OFFICER,And bears.
5,8,SAM,"Right. Now, what about Mrs. Randolph? The file says she saw the whole thing."
5,8,OFFICER,"Yes, she did."
5,8,OFFICER,My heart goes out to that poor woman.
5,8,DEAN,She said bear.
5,8,OFFICER,Kathy Randolph went through a hell of a trauma. She's confused.
5,8,SAM,What did she say?
5,8,KATHY,"No, it must have been a bear."
5,8,KATHY,"I mean, what else could it have been?"
5,8,SAM,"Mrs. Randolph, what do you think it was?"
5,8,KATHY,"No, I, I remember clearly now."
5,8,KATHY,It was definitely a bear.
5,8,DEAN,"We're sure it was. But see, it helps us to hear every angle. So just tell us what you thought you saw."
5,8,KATHY,"It's impossible, but...I could have sworn I saw...the Incredible Hulk."
5,8,SAM,The Incredible Hulk.
5,8,KATHY,I told you it was crazy.
5,8,DEAN,Bana or Norton?
5,8,KATHY,"Oh, no, those movies were terrible. The TV Hulk."
5,8,DEAN,Lou Ferrigno.
5,8,KATHY,Yes.
5,8,DEAN,Spiky-hair Lou Ferrigno.
5,8,KATHY,Yes.
5,8,DEAN,Huh.
5,8,KATHY,You think I'm crazy.
5,8,DEAN,"No. Uh, no, it's just...is there, uh, would there be any reason that Lou Ferrigno, the Incredible Hulk, would have a grudge against your husband?"
5,8,KATHY,No.
5,8,DEAN,No.
5,8,SAM,Hey.
5,8,DEAN,Find anything?
5,8,SAM,"Well, uh, I saw the house."
5,8,DEAN,And?
5,8,SAM,"And there is a giant eight-foot-wide hole where the front door used to be. Almost like, uh—"
5,8,DEAN,A Hulk-sized hole.
5,8,SAM,Maybe. What do you got?
5,8,DEAN,"Well, it turns out that Bill Randolph had quite the temper. He's got two counts of spousal battery, bar brawls, and court-ordered anger management sessions. You might say you wouldn't like him when he's angry."
5,8,SAM,"So a hothead getting killed by TV's greatest hothead. Kinda sounds like just desserts, doesn't it?"
5,8,SAM,It's all starting to make sense.
5,8,DEAN,How is it starting to make sense?
5,8,SAM,"Well, I found something else at the crime scene."
5,8,SAM,Candy wrappers.
5,8,SAM,Lots of them.
5,8,DEAN,"Just desserts, sweet tooth, screwing with people before you kill 'em—we're dealing with the Trickster, aren't we?"
5,8,SAM,Sure looks like it.
5,8,DEAN,Good. I've wanted to gank that mother since Mystery Spot.
5,8,SAM,You sure?
5,8,DEAN,Yeah I'm sure.
5,8,SAM,"No, I mean are you sure you wanna kill him?"
5,8,DEAN,Son of a bitch didn't think twice about icing me a thousand times.
5,8,SAM,"No, I know, I mean, I'm just saying—"
5,8,DEAN,"What are you saying? If you don't want to kill him, then what?"
5,8,SAM,Talk to him?
5,8,DEAN,What?
5,8,SAM,"Think about it, Dean. He's one of the most powerful creatures we've ever met. Maybe we can use him."
5,8,DEAN,For what?
5,8,SAM,"Okay, Trickster's like a Hugh Hefner type, right? Wine, women, song—maybe he doesn't want the party to end. Maybe he hates this angels and demons stuff as much as we do. Maybe he'll help us."
5,8,DEAN,You're serious.
5,8,SAM,Yeah.
5,8,DEAN,Ally with the Trickster.
5,8,SAM,Yeah.
5,8,DEAN,"A bloody, violent monster, and you wanna be Facebook friends with him? Nice, Sammy."
5,8,SAM,"The world is gonna end, Dean. We don't have the luxury of a moral stand. Look, I'm just saying it's worth a shot. That's all. If it doesn't work, we'll kill him."
5,8,DEAN,"How are we gonna find the guy, anyway?"
5,8,SAM,"Well, he never takes just one victim, right? He'll show."
5,8,SCANNER,"Um, Dispatch? I, I got a possible 187 out here at the old paper mill on Route 6?"
5,8,SAM,Hey.
5,8,DISPATCH,"Roger that. What are you looking at there, son?"
5,8,SCANNER,"Honestly, Walt, I, I wouldn't even know how to describe what I'm seeing. Just—send everybody."
5,8,DISPATCH,"All right, stay calm, stay by your car. Help's on the way."
5,8,DEAN,That sounds weird.
5,8,SAM,Weird enough to be our guy.
5,8,DEAN,"There was a murder here, and there's no police cars. There's nobody. How's that look to you?"
5,8,SAM,Crappy.
5,8,DEAN,What the hell?
5,8,BLONDE DOCTOR,Doctor.
5,8,DR. WANG,Doctor.
5,8,SAM,Doctor?
5,8,BRUNETTE DOCTOR,Doctor.
5,8,SAM,Ow!
5,8,BRUNETTE DOCTOR,Seriously.
5,8,SAM,What?
5,8,BRUNETTE DOCTOR,"Seriously? You're brilliant, you know that? And a coward. You're a brilliant coward."
5,8,SAM,Um. What are you talking about?
5,8,BRUNETTE DOCTOR,As if you don't know!
5,8,DEAN,I don't believe this.
5,8,SAM,What?
5,8,DEAN,That's Dr. Piccolo.
5,8,SAM,Who?
5,8,DEAN,Dr. Ellen Piccolo.
5,8,DEAN,The sexy yet earnest doctor at—
5,8,DEAN,Seattle Mercy Hospital.
5,8,SAM,Dean.
5,8,SAM,What the hell are you talking about?
5,8,DEAN,"The doctor getups. The, the sexy interns. The 'seriously's. It all makes sense."
5,8,SAM,What makes sense? What's going on?
5,8,DEAN,"Dude, what the hell."
5,8,SAM,I don't know.
5,8,DEAN,"No, seriously, what the hell."
5,8,SAM,I don't know.
5,8,DEAN,One theory. Any theory.
5,8,SAM,"Uh, the Trickster trapped us in TV Land."
5,8,DEAN,That's your theory. That's stupid.
5,8,DEAN,"Yeah, but TV land isn't TV Land. I mean, there's actors and, and lights and crew members, you know. This looks real."
5,8,SAM,"It can't be. Dean, how can this possibly be real?"
5,8,DEAN,I don't know.
5,8,DR. WANG,Doctors.
5,8,DEAN,There goes Dr. Wang. The sexy but arrogant heart surgeon.
5,8,DEAN,"And there's Johnny Drake. Oh, he's not even alive, he's a ghost in the mind of—"
5,8,DEAN,Of her. The sexy yet neurotic doctor over there.
5,8,SAM,So...this show has ghosts? Why?
5,8,DEAN,I don't know. It is compelling.
5,8,SAM,I thought you said you weren't a fan.
5,8,DEAN,I'm not. I'm not.
5,8,DEAN,Oh boy.
5,8,SAM,What?
5,8,DEAN,It's him.
5,8,SAM,Who?
5,8,DEAN,"It's him, it's Dr. Sexy."
5,8,DR. PALMER,Doctor.
5,8,DEAN,Doctor.
5,8,DR. PALMER,Doctor.
5,8,SAM,Doctor.
5,8,DR. PALMER,You want to give me one good reason why you defied my direct order to do the experimental face transplant on Mrs. Biehl?
5,8,DEAN,One reason?
5,8,DEAN,Sure.
5,8,DEAN,You're not Dr. Sexy.
5,8,DR. PALMER,You're crazy.
5,8,DEAN,Really? Because I swore part of what makes Dr. Sexy sexy is the fact that he wears cowboy boots. Not tennis shoes.
5,8,SAM,Yeah. You're not a fan.
5,8,DEAN,It's a guilty pleasure.
5,8,DR. PALMER,Call security.
5,8,DEAN,"Yeah, go ahead, pal. See, we know who you are."
5,8,TRICKSTER,You guys are getting better!
5,8,DEAN,Get us the hell out of here.
5,8,TRICKSTER,Or what?
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Don't say you have wooden stakes, big guy."
5,8,SAM,"That was you on the police scanner, right? This is a trick."
5,8,TRICKSTER,Hello? Trickster. Come on! I heard you two yahoos were in town. How could I resist?
5,8,DEAN,Where the hell are we?
5,8,TRICKSTER,Like it? It's all homemade. My own sets—
5,8,TRICKSTER,My own actors...call it my own little idiot box.
5,8,DEAN,How do we get out?
5,8,TRICKSTER,"That, my friend, is the sixty-four-dollar question."
5,8,SAM,"Whatever. We just, we need to talk to you. We need your help."
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Hm, let me guess. You two muttonheads broke the world, and you want me to sweep up your mess."
5,8,SAM,Please. Just five minutes. Hear us out.
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Sure. Tell you what. Survive the next twenty-four hours, we'll talk."
5,8,DEAN,Survive what?
5,8,TRICKSTER,The game!
5,8,DEAN,What game?
5,8,TRICKSTER,You're in it.
5,8,DEAN,How do we play?
5,8,TRICKSTER,You're playing it.
5,8,DEAN,What are the rules?
5,8,DEAN,"Oh, son of a bitch."
5,8,BLONDE DOCTOR,Dr. Sexy? Dr. Sexy?
5,8,INTERCOM,Paging Dr. Sexy. Report to the ER.
5,8,DEAN,"Oh, by the way. Talking with monsters? Hell of a plan."
5,8,SAM,"Just, what do we do now?"
5,8,DEAN,You know what I'm doing? Leaving.
5,8,SAM,"Lady, what the hell?"
5,8,DR. PICCOLO,"You are a brilliant, brilliant—"
5,8,SAM,Yeah. A coward. You already said that. But I got news for you. I am not a doctor.
5,8,DR. PICCOLO,"Don't say that. You are the finest cerebrovascular neurosurgeon I have ever met, and I have met plenty. So that girl died on your table. It wasn't your fault. It wasn't anybody's fault. Sometimes people just die."
5,8,SAM,I have no idea what you're saying to me.
5,8,DR. PICCOLO,You're afraid. You're afraid to operate again. And you're afraid to love.
5,8,SAM,"Yeah, we're getting out of here."
5,8,MAN,Hey. Doctor.
5,8,DEAN,Yeah.
5,8,MAN,My wife needs that face transplant.
5,8,DEAN,"Okay. You know what, pal? None of this is real, and your wife doesn't need jack squat. Okay?"
5,8,MR. BIEHL,"Hey, Doctor."
5,8,DEAN,Real—it's real—
5,8,SAM,"No no no, no no no no no—hey! We need a doctor!"
5,8,BLONDE DOCTOR,BP is eighty over fifty and dropping.
5,8,DR. WANG,Doctor.
5,8,SAM,What?
5,8,DEAN,Sam. Do something. Come on.
5,8,SAM,I don't know how to use any of this crap.
5,8,DEAN,Figure it out.
5,8,DEAN,Sam. Come on. I'm waiting.
5,8,SAM,"Okay. Um. I need a penknife, some dental floss, a sewing needle, and a fifth of whiskey."
5,8,SAM,Stat!
5,8,DEAN,We okay? How's it looking?
5,8,SAM,Yep. You'll be fine.
5,8,HOST,Let's play Nutcracker!
5,8,HOST,Sam Winchester.
5,8,HOST,Countdown.
5,8,SAM,What?
5,8,SAM,"Uh, what am I supposed to say?"
5,8,DEAN,You think I know?
5,8,SAM,"Uh, I, I don't, I don't understand Japanese."
5,8,SAM,"Is he screwing with me? I, I, I can't speak Japanese."
5,8,HOST,Ruby!
5,8,HOST,"I'm sorry, Sam Winchester."
5,8,SAM,Sorry? Sir? For what?
5,8,SAM,Dean?
5,8,HOST,Nutcracker!
5,8,HOST,Nutcracker!
5,8,DEAN,Sam?
5,8,DEAN,You okay?
5,8,DEAN,Oh now what?
5,8,DEAN,Cas?
5,8,SAM,Is this another trick?
5,8,CASTIEL,"It's me. Uh, what are you doing here?"
5,8,DEAN,Us? What are you doing here?
5,8,CASTIEL,Looking for you. You've been missing for days.
5,8,SAM,"So get us the hell out of here, then!"
5,8,CASTIEL,Let's go.
5,8,DEAN,Cas?
5,8,HOST,"No, no, no, no. Mr. Trickster does not like pretty-boy angels."
5,8,HOST,Dean Winchester.
5,8,HOST,Countdown.
5,8,DEAN,"What do I do, what do I do?"
5,8,SAM,What?
5,8,DEAN,I don't wanna get hit in the nuts.
5,8,SAM,"I don't know, I, I, uh, just, uh—wait."
5,8,DEAN,What?
5,8,SAM,I played a doctor.
5,8,DEAN,What?
5,8,DEAN,So?
5,8,SAM,So I played the role the Trickster wanted me to play. Maybe we should just go along with it.
5,8,DEAN,Go along with what?
5,8,SAM,"With the game! You know, we're on a game show, right? So just answer the question!"
5,8,DEAN,In Japanese?
5,8,SAM,Yeah!
5,8,DEAN,I don't know Japanese!
5,8,SAM,Try!
5,8,DEAN,Dammit!
5,8,HOST,"Dean Winchester, Nutcracker champion!"
5,8,SAM,How did you do that?
5,8,DEAN,I have no idea.
5,8,SAM,"So that's it. We play our roles, we survive."
5,8,DEAN,"Yeah, but play our roles for how long?"
5,8,SAM,Good question.
5,8,WOMAN,I've got genital herpes.
5,8,OLD MAN,I've got genital herpes.
5,8,SAM,Seriously?
5,8,DEAN,"Hey, you're the one who said play our roles."
5,8,SAM,Yeah. Right.
5,8,SAM,I've got genital herpes.
5,8,WOMAN,I try to be responsible.
5,8,OLD MAN,Did I try.
5,8,SAM,But now I take twice-daily Herpexia to reduce my chances of passing it on.
5,8,WOMAN,Ask your doctor about using Herpexia.
5,8,DEAN (voiceover),"Patients should always consult with a physician before using Herpexia. Possible side effects include headache, diarrhea, permanent erectile dysfunction, thoughts of suicide, and nausea."
5,8,SAM,I am doing all I can to slightly lessen the spread of—of genital herpes. And that's a good thing.
5,8,DEAN,Son of a bitch!
5,8,SAM,"Uh, I am really, really, very sorry, but, uh, we've got some work to do."
5,8,WOMAN,But we did do work! In depth.
5,8,DEAN,How long do we have to keep doing this?
5,8,SAM,I don't know.
5,8,SAM,Maybe forever?
5,8,SAM,We might die in here.
5,8,DEAN,How was that funny? Vultures.
5,8,DEAN,You okay?
5,8,CASTIEL,I don't have much time.
5,8,SAM,What happened?
5,8,CASTIEL,I got out.
5,8,DEAN,From where?
5,8,CASTIEL,Listen to me. Something is not right. This thing is much more powerful than it should be.
5,8,DEAN,What thing—the Trickster?
5,8,CASTIEL,If it is a trickster.
5,8,SAM,What do you mean?
5,8,TRICKSTER,Hello!
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Thank you. Thank you, ladies."
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Hi, Castiel!"
5,8,SAM,You know him?
5,8,DEAN,Where did you just send him?
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Relax, he'll live. ...Maybe."
5,8,DEAN,"All right, you know what? I am done with the monkey dance, okay? We get it."
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Yeah? Get what, hotshot?"
5,8,DEAN,"Playing our roles, right? That's your game?"
5,8,TRICKSTER,That's half the game.
5,8,SAM,What's the other half?
5,8,TRICKSTER,Play your roles out there.
5,8,DEAN,What's that supposed to mean?
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Oh, you know. Sam starring as Lucifer. Dean starring as Michael. Your celebrity death match. Play your roles."
5,8,SAM,You want us to say yes to those sons of bitches?
5,8,TRICKSTER,Hells yeah. Let's light this candle!
5,8,SAM,"We do that, the world will end."
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Yeah? And whose fault is that? Who popped Lucifer out of the box? Hm? Look, it's started. You started it. It can't be stopped. So let's get it over with!"
5,8,DEAN,"Heaven or hell, which side you on?"
5,8,TRICKSTER,I'm not on either side.
5,8,DEAN,"Yeah, right. You're grabbing ankle for Michael or Lucifer. Which one is it?"
5,8,TRICKSTER,"You listen to me, you arrogant dick. I don't work for either of those S.O.B.s. Believe me."
5,8,DEAN,"Oh, you're somebody's bitch."
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Don't you ever, ever presume to know what I am. Now listen very closely. Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna suck it up, accept your responsibilities, and play the roles that destiny has chosen for you."
5,8,SAM,And if we don't?
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Then you'll stay here in TV Land. Forever. Three hundred channels and, uh, nothing's on."
5,8,DEAN,"Oh, come on."
5,8,OFFICER,"So, what do you think?"
5,8,DEAN,"What do I think? I think go screw yourself, that's what I think."
5,8,SAM,"Uh, could you give us a sec, please? Thanks."
5,8,SAM,You gotta calm down.
5,8,DEAN,Calm down? I am wearing sunglasses at night.
5,8,DEAN,You know who does that? No-talent douchebags.
5,8,DEAN,"I hate this game. I hate that we're in a procedural cop show and you wanna know why? Because I hate procedural cop shows. There's like three hundred of them on television and they're all the freaking same. It's ooh, plane crashed here—oh shut up."
5,8,SAM,Hey.
5,8,DEAN,What?
5,8,SAM,Check out sweet tooth over there.
5,8,DEAN,Think that's him?
5,8,SAM,"Just, um, follow my lead."
5,8,OFFICER,"You, uh, you okay?"
5,8,DEAN,Yeah. What do we got?
5,8,OFFICER,"Well, aside from the ligature marks around his neck, he has what appears to be a roll of quarters jammed down his throat."
5,8,SAM,"Well I say, jackpot."
5,8,OFFICER,"Also, there is a stab wound to the lower abdomen."
5,8,DEAN,"Well I say, no guts, no glory."
5,8,SAM,Get that guy a Tums.
5,8,DEAN,Gutter ball.
5,8,OFFICER,"Good one, guys."
5,8,TRICKSTER,"You've got the wrong guy, idiots."
5,8,DEAN,Did we?
5,8,DEAN,"I'm worried, man. What that SOB did to Cas. You know, where is he?"
5,8,DEAN,Sam?
5,8,DEAN,Where are you?
5,8,DEAN,Sam. It's me. Where the hell did you go?
5,8,SAM,Dean?
5,8,DEAN,Sam? Where are you?
5,8,SAM,I don't know.
5,8,SAM,Oh crap. I don't think we killed the Trickster.
5,8,DEAN,"Okay, stake didn't work. So, what, this is another trick?"
5,8,SAM,I don't know. Maybe the stake didn't work because it's not a trickster?
5,8,DEAN,What do you mean?
5,8,SAM,You heard Cas. He said this thing was too powerful to be a trickster.
5,8,DEAN,And did you notice the way he looked at Cas? Almost like he knew him.
5,8,SAM,And how pissed he got when you brought up Michael and Lucifer.
5,8,DEAN,Son of a bitch.
5,8,SAM,What?
5,8,DEAN,I think I know what we're dealing with.
5,8,SAM,Dean?
5,8,DEAN,What?
5,8,SAM,"That, uh, feels really uncomfortable."
5,8,SAM,Ow. You sure this is gonna work?
5,8,DEAN,"No, but I have no other ideas."
5,8,DEAN,"All right, you son of a bitch! Uncle! We'll do it!"
5,8,SAM,Should I honk?
5,8,SAM,Eat me.
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Okay, boys. Ready to go quietly?"
5,8,DEAN,"Whoa whoa whoa, not so fast. Nobody's going anywhere until Sam has opposable thumbs."
5,8,TRICKSTER,What's the difference? Satan's going to ride his ass one way or another.
5,8,TRICKSTER,Happy?
5,8,DEAN,Tell me one thing. Why didn't the stake kill you?
5,8,TRICKSTER,I am the Trickster.
5,8,DEAN,Or maybe you're not.
5,8,DEAN,Maybe you've always been an angel.
5,8,TRICKSTER,"A what? Somebody slip a mickey in your power shake, kid?"
5,8,DEAN,I'll tell you what. You just jump out of the holy fire and we'll call it our mistake.
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Well played, boys. Well played. Where'd you get the holy oil?"
5,8,DEAN,"Well, you might say we pulled it out of Sam's ass."
5,8,TRICKSTER,Where'd I screw up?
5,8,SAM,You didn't. Nobody gets the jump on Cas like you did.
5,8,DEAN,Mostly it was the way you talked about Armageddon.
5,8,TRICKSTER,Meaning?
5,8,DEAN,"Well, call it personal experience, but nobody gets that angry unless they're talking about their own family."
5,8,SAM,"So which one are you? Grumpy, Sneezy, or Douchey?"
5,8,TRICKSTER,"Gabriel, okay? They call me Gabriel."
5,8,SAM,Gabriel? The archangel?
5,8,GABRIEL,Guilty.
5,8,DEAN,"Okay, Gabriel. How does an archangel become a trickster?"
5,8,GABRIEL,"My own private witness protection. I skipped out of heaven, had a face transplant, carved out my own little corner of the world. Till you two screwed it all up."
5,8,DEAN,What did Daddy say when you ran off and joined the pagans?
5,8,GABRIEL,Daddy doesn't say anything about anything.
5,8,SAM,Then what happened? Why'd you ditch?
5,8,DEAN,"Do you blame him? I mean, his brothers are heavyweight douchenozzles."
5,8,GABRIEL,"Shut your cakehole. You don't know anything about my family. I love my father, my brothers. Love them. But watching them turn on each other? Tear at each other's throats? I couldn't bear it! Okay? So I left. And now it's happening all over again."
5,8,SAM,Then help us stop it.
5,8,GABRIEL,It can't be stopped.
5,8,DEAN,You wanna see the end of the world?
5,8,GABRIEL,"I want it to be over! I have to sit back and watch my own brothers kill each other thanks to you two! Heaven, hell, I don't care who wins, I just want it to be over."
5,8,SAM,"It doesn't have to be like that. There has to be some way to, to pull the plug."
5,8,GABRIEL,"You do not know my family. What you guys call the apocalypse, I used to call Sunday dinner. That's why there's no stopping this, because this isn't about a war. It's about two brothers that loved each other and betrayed each other. You'd think you'd be able to relate."
5,8,SAM,What are you talking about?
5,8,GABRIEL,"You sorry sons of bitches. Why do you think you two are the vessels? Think about it. Michael, the big brother, loyal to an absent father, and Lucifer, the little brother, rebellious of Daddy's plan. You were born to this, boys. It's your destiny! It was always you! As it is in heaven, so it must be on earth. One brother has to kill the other."
5,8,DEAN,What the hell are you saying?
5,8,GABRIEL,"Why do you think I've always taken such an interest in you? Because from the moment Dad flipped on the lights around here, we knew it was all gonna end with you. Always."
5,8,DEAN,No. That's not gonna happen.
5,8,GABRIEL,I'm sorry. But it is.
5,8,GABRIEL,"Guys. I wish this were a TV show. Easy answers, endings wrapped up in a bow...but this is real, and it's gonna end bloody for all of us. That's just how it's gotta be."
5,8,GABRIEL,So. Boys. Now what? We stare at each other for the rest of eternity?
5,8,DEAN,"Well, first of all, you're gonna bring Cas back from wherever you stashed him."
5,8,GABRIEL,Oh am I.
5,8,DEAN,Yeah. Or we're going to dunk you in some holy oil and deep-fry ourselves an archangel.
5,8,DEAN,"Cas, you okay?"
5,8,CASTIEL,"I'm fine. Hello, Gabriel."
5,8,GABRIEL,"Hey, bro. How's the search for Daddy going? Let me guess. Awful."
5,8,DEAN,"Okay, we're out of here. Come on, Sam."
5,8,GABRIEL,Uh. Okay. Guys?
5,8,GABRIEL,"So, so what? Huh?"
5,8,GABRIEL,"You're just gonna, you're gonna leave me here forever?"
5,8,DEAN,"No. We're not, 'cause we don't screw with people the way you do. And for the record? This isn't about some prize fight between your brothers or some destiny that can't be stopped. This is about you being too afraid to stand up to your family."
5,8,DEAN,Don't say I never did anything for you.
5,8,DEAN,"All that stuff he was spouting in there, you think it was the truth?"
5,8,SAM,I think he believes it.
5,8,DEAN,So what do we do?
5,8,SAM,I don't know.
5,8,DEAN,Well I'll tell you one thing. Right about now I wish I was back in a TV show.
5,8,SAM,"Yeah, me too."
5,9,MAN,"ha-ha-ha. Hey Dean, looking good."
5,9,DEAN,Yeah well serves them right.
5,9,INTERIOR. BAR,
5,9,DEAN,Get downstairs ok? Go go!
5,9,INTERIOR. HALLWAY,
5,9,CHUCK,"(On stage) Ah, what does the future hold for Sam and Dean? Well, how do you feel about angels? Yeah, because let me tell you, they're not nearly as lame as you think."
5,11,DEAN,Hellhounds?
5,11,MEG,"Yeah, Dean, your favorite!"
5,11,JO,I can't fight. I can't walk. But I can do something. We got everything we need...to build a bomb.
5,11,DEAN,What are we doing?
5,11,SAM,We're hunting a ghost.
5,11,DEAN,You know who does that? Crazy people! We...are insane!
5,11,CASTIEL,"Tomorrow, we hunt the devil. This is our last night on earth."
5,11,CROWLEY VOICE-OVER,"Take this thing to Lucifer, and empty it into his face."
5,11,LUCIFER,(talking to SAM) You know I'd never hurt you.
5,11,SAM,"You listen to me, you son of a bitch."
5,11,SAM,I'm gonna kill you myself. I am going to rip your heart out!
5,11,LUCIFER,"That's good, Sam. You keep fanning that fire in your belly. All that pent-up rage...I'm gonna need it."
5,11,DR. FULLER,The nurses tell me that you're not taking your medication. You wanna tell me why? (SUSAN is silent.) Susan?
5,11,SUSAN,"The pills make me sleepy, but I can't. If i sleep, it'll come."
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Now, we have talked about this."
5,11,SUSAN,But it killed Annie.
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Susan, you're schizophrenic. Your mind plays tricks on you. You get confused. Sometimes, you see things."
5,11,SUSAN,"I know what I am. Like, I can see my dead son standing right behind you."
5,11,SUSAN,I know he's not real.
5,11,SUSAN,But the monster...It is real.
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Annie was your roommate, and what happened to her was painful for all of us. Perhaps it's easier for you to conjure up a monster than to face how tragic her suicide really was."
5,11,SUSAN,I can hear it at night...in the walls. Please. You have to believe me.
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Susan, there is no such thing as monsters."
5,11,SUSAN,"Oh, my God! Help me! Help me!"
5,11,NURSE,They're starting early tonight.
5,11,SUSAN,Hurry!
5,11,SUSAN,It's coming!
5,11,SUSAN,"Help me, please! Help me!"
5,11,Title card,
5,11,DR. FULLER,You were referred to me by a Dr. Babar in Chicago.
5,11,DEAN,That's right.
5,11,DR. FULLER,Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
5,11,DEAN,"I don't know. I don't have any elephant books. Look, Doctor, I-I-I think the doc was in over his head with this one. (DEAN points at SAM) 'Cause my brother is..."
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Okay, fine, thank you. That's-that's really not necessary. (DR. FULLER grabs his file and notepad) Why don't you tell me how you're feeling, Alex?"
5,11,SAM,"(sighs) I'm fine. I mean, okay, a little depressed, I guess."
5,11,DR. FULLER,Okay. Any idea why?
5,11,SAM,Probably because I started the apocalypse.
5,11,DR. FULLER,(looks up at SAM) The apocalypse?
5,11,SAM,"Yeah, that's right."
5,11,DR. FULLER,"(looks at DEAN, who smiles) And you think you started it?"
5,11,SAM,"Well, yeah, I mean...I killed this demon, Lilith, and I accidentally freed Lucifer from hell. So now, he's topside, and we're trying to stop him."
5,11,DR. FULLER,"(looks at DEAN, who looks exasperated) Who is?"
5,11,SAM,Me. A-and him. (points at DEAN) And this one angel.
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Oh, you mean, like a...like an angel on your shoulder."
5,11,SAM,No. His name's Castiel. He wears a trench coat.
5,11,DEAN,"See what I mean, Doc? The kid's been beating himself up about this for months. The apocalypse wasn't his fault."
5,11,DR. FULLER,"(looks up at DEAN, stunned) It's not?"
5,11,DEAN,"No. There was this other demon, Ruby. She got him addicted to demon blood, and near the end, he was practically chugging this stuff."
5,11,DEAN,"My brother's not evil. He was just...high...yeah? So, could you fix him up so we can get back to traveling around the country and hunting monsters?"
5,11,DR. FULLER,Irma...cancel my lunch.
5,11,HAPPY NURSE,--keep you both under observation for a couple of days.
5,11,DEAN,"Both? Me, too?"
5,11,HAPPY NURSE,"Yes, Sugar. The doctor thinks that would be best."
5,11,HAPPY NURSE,"Alright, I'm just gonna give you a little check-up."
5,11,HAPPY NURSE,(smiles) Okie-dokie.
5,11,HAPPY NURSE,"Alright, you can go ahead and take down your pants."
5,11,SAM,"(looks up in horror) Wait, w-what? W-what for?"
5,11,DEAN,How was your Silkwood shower?
5,11,SAM,"Okay. Yeah, good. Yeah, good, um--good water pressure. Did the nurse..."
5,11,DEAN,She was very thorough.
5,11,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, good. Good. Yeah."
5,11,DEAN,I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
5,11,SAM,"Hey, it's the least we could do. Martin saved Dad's ass more times than we can count. He's a great hunter."
5,11,DEAN,Was. Until Albuquerque.
5,11,SAM,"Besides, I just figure it's best we keep busy. That's all."
5,11,DEAN,Better than what?
5,11,SAM,Nothing.
5,11,SAM,"Okay. Look...um...last few weeks, you've kind of been worrying me."
5,11,DEAN,"(rolls his eyes) Oh, come on, Sam. Stop. Look, just because we're in the loony bin doesn't give you the right to head-shrink me."
5,11,SAM,Dean--
5,11,DEAN,"Ellen and Jo dying--Yeah, it was a friggin' tragedy, okay? But I'm not gonna wallow in it."
5,11,SAM,"Dean, you always do this. You can't just keep this crap in."
5,11,DEAN,"(chuckles) Watch me. (looks over towards a table) Oh, there he is."
5,11,MARTIN,"Sam, Dean, wow. (stands, shakes SAM'S hand) Wow, you boys got big. You look good."
5,11,SAM,"Thanks. You do, too, Martin."
5,11,MARTIN,"Uh...Well, thanks for coming. (motions for them to sit)"
5,11,SAM,Yeah.
5,11,MARTIN,"In the old days, I could've taken care of this thing with both hands tied behind my back...but, well...now..."
5,11,SAM,What do you think it is that we're hunting?
5,11,MARTIN,"I don't know yet. A ghost, demon, monster...animal, vegetable, mineral. (chuckles) Hospital's had five deaths in the last four months. Doctors keep calling it suicides, but they're wrong."
5,11,SAM,"So, you've seen this thing?"
5,11,DEAN,Has anyone seen this thing?
5,11,MARTIN,"Well, a couple patients have, uh...had glimpses, but there's not a lot to go on."
5,11,DEAN,Are they reliable?
5,11,MARTIN,"Oh, sure, why wouldn't they be?"
5,11,DEAN,"Gee, I don't know."
5,11,MARTIN,"I know you boys think I'm a bag of loose screws. Now, you wouldn't be wrong. But I wouldn't have called you unless there was something here. I can feel it in my gut."
5,11,SAM,We believe you. Have you checked any of the bodies? Found signs of an attack?
5,11,MARTIN,"Well, uh, no...I don't go around dead b-b-b-bodies anymore."
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Alex, Eddie."
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Well, I'm glad to see you're making friends. Why don't you and, uh, Mr. Creaser join us for group? Please. Right this way."
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Actually, I'm gonna be putting you in the afternoon group."
5,11,DEAN,What? Why?
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Well, to be frank, uh, the relationship that you have with your brother seems dangerously codependent. I think a little time apart will do you both good."
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Alright, so...who would like to start us off?"
5,11,DR. FULLER,Anyone else?
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Alright, Ted. Calm down."
5,11,TED,(lowers his hand) I am calm. And I'd very calmly like to talk about the monster that's hunting us.
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Ted, we're not going to have that discussion again."
5,11,DR. FULLER,It's not good for group.
5,11,TED,I agree. You know what else isn't good for group? A monster eating all our faces off.
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Alright, fine, thank you. Now, anyone else?"
5,11,TED,I saw it...when it killed Susan.
5,11,OTHER PATIENT,"I did, too. It had big lobster claws."
5,11,TED,"No, it didn't."
5,11,TED,Stop it. Stop helping. Listen to me. We're all dead!
5,11,DR. FULLER,"That's enough. (leans forward, taking off his glasses) There is no monster."
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Now, Ted, do you need me to call the orderlies..."
5,11,DR. FULLER,...or can you behave?
5,11,TED,(nods) Behave.
5,11,DEAN,King me! (laughs)
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,Eddie?
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,I'm Dr. Erica Cartwright. I've been assigned to your case.
5,11,DEAN,You're my shrink? (smiles seductively) Heh. Lucky me.
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,(opens her file) And you're my...paranoid schizophrenic with narcissistic personality disorder and religious psychosis. (closes her file and smiles) Lucky me.
5,11,DEAN,(looks down awkwardly) Hm.
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,Can we talk? (sits opposite DEAN at the table)
5,11,DEAN,Yes. I actually got some questions for you.
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,"What a coincidence. I've got some for you, too."
5,11,DEAN,"Well, then...Quid pro quo, Clarice."
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,"Okay, Hannibal. I'll go first. How many hours a night do you sleep?"
5,11,DEAN,"Three or four, every couple of nights. What can you tell me about the recent suicides in here?"
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,They were tragic.
5,11,DEAN,"But you haven't noticed anything...strange, like, uh...I don't know, black smoke or sulfur?"
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,No. Why? What's that supposed to mean?
5,11,DEAN,"Demon signs. I hunt demons, monsters, that kind of thing."
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,How many drinks do you have a week?
5,11,DEAN,"Well, I gotta sleep sometime. So, uh, what's seven days times--somewhere in the mid fifties. You ever feel any, uh, cold spots or get a chill walking through the hospital?"
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,Not that I can remember. If I had?
5,11,DEAN,It means there's a ghost around.
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,Okay. When was the last time you were in a long-term relationship?
5,11,DEAN,Define long-term.
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,More than two months.
5,11,DEAN,Never. Have the patients reported seeing anything weird?
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,In here? (chuckles) All the time.
5,11,DEAN,Right.
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,So... (leans towards DEAN) let's talk about your father.
5,11,SAM,"Dean, hey."
5,11,SAM,You okay?
5,11,DEAN,"I just got thraped. So, no, I am not okay. Tell me you found something."
5,11,SAM,Yeah. A guy says he saw the creature. We should talk to him. You wanna meet here in an hour?
5,11,DEAN,"Yeah, sooner we take care of this thing, sooner we can get gone. This place gives me the creeps."
5,11,WENDY,Hi.
5,11,DEAN,Hi.
5,11,WENDY,I'm Wendy.
5,11,DEAN,Uh-huh.
5,11,DEAN,Maybe this place isn't so bad after all.
5,11,SAM,Dude...you CANNOT hit that.
5,11,DEAN,"(watches WENDY) Oh, so torn."
5,11,DEAN,"Well, it's about time. Nurses are on their rounds. We got, like, fifteen, twenty minutes. So, where is this guy?"
5,11,SAM,Room 306.
5,11,DEAN,"Hurry up! Come on, hurry up!"
5,11,SAM,"(looks up at DEAN) Back off, Dean!"
5,11,SAM,"Hey, I think I found something."
5,11,DEAN,What do you got?
5,11,SAM,"Right here. Uh, give me a hand."
5,11,SAM,This hole goes all the way through to his brain.
5,11,DEAN,What does that mean?
5,11,SAM,(spots a bone saw) Let's find out.
5,11,DEAN,Seriously?
5,11,SAM,You might want to keep watch.
5,11,SAM,"(holds up the brain) Look, his brain's been sucked dry."
5,11,DEAN,That's fascinating. Somebody's coming.
5,11,HAPPY NURSE,What are you boys doing in here?
5,11,DEAN,(smiles) Pudding!
5,11,HAPPY NURSE,"(smiles) Alright, come on, you two."
5,11,DEAN,(whispers) Crazy works.
5,11,DEAN,Are those original Gacy's? (chuckles)
5,11,MARTIN,I painted those.
5,11,SAM,"Back on point, please. Um...so, whatever this thing is--"
5,11,DEAN,"(to MARTIN, about the pictures) It's good."
5,11,SAM,"It Slurpees your brain, sucks you dry."
5,11,DEAN,"Yeah, then it makes the deaths look like suicides. Any ideas?"
5,11,MARTIN,Yeah. A bad one.
5,11,DEAN,What is it?
5,11,MARTIN,"Well, I bet you a chicken dinner it's what we're up against...a wraith. They crack open skulls and feed on brain juice."
5,11,SAM,You ever tangle with one before?
5,11,MARTIN,"Never. Never wanted to, neither."
5,11,DEAN,"So, how do we kill it?"
5,11,MARTIN,"Silver. You so much as touch a wraith with the stuff, and the skin will crackle. Now, that's the good news. The bad news is...they can pass as humans."
5,11,MARTIN,"It could be any Peter, Paul and Mary in the joint."
5,11,DEAN,"Fantastic. So, how do we find it?"
5,11,MARTIN,A mirror. Lore says a wraith will show its true form in a mirror.
5,11,DEAN,"Okay, well, we just gotta spot check every patient and every staff member."
5,11,SAM,"(nods) Okay. Yeah. But--I mean, what's it doing in a mental hospital?"
5,11,DEAN,A nuthouse; it's-it's-it's a perfect captive victim pool.
5,11,MARTIN,Sure. Who's gonna believe a patient when they say they saw a monster? It's the perfect hunting ground.
5,11,DEAN,"What's up, Doc?"
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,You tell me.
5,11,DEAN,"Hunting. A wraith, actually. Could be anybody."
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,"So, I could be a monster?"
5,11,DEAN,"No, you're clean."
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,Why you?
5,11,DEAN,"Why me, what?"
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,Why do you have to hunt monsters? Why not let someone else do it?
5,11,DEAN,"(shrugs, smiles) Can't find anybody else that dumb. (thinks for a moment) It's my job. Somebody's gotta save people's asses, yours included."
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,"So, is there a quota? How many people do you have to save?"
5,11,DEAN,All of them.
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,All of them? You think you have to save everyone?
5,11,DEAN,Yep. Whole wide world of sports.
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,How?
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,"Believe me, whatever you've got, I've heard weirder."
5,11,DEAN,"It's the end of the world, okay? I mean, it's a damn Biblical apocalypse, and if I don't stop it and save everyone, then no one will, and we all die."
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,That's horrible.
5,11,DEAN,"Yeah, tell me about it."
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,"I mean, apocalypse or no apocalypse...monsters or no monsters, that's a crushing weight to have on your shoulders. To feel like six billion lives depend on you...God...how do you get up in the morning?"
5,11,DEAN,That's a good question.
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Hello, Eddie."
5,11,DEAN,Doc.
5,11,SAM,"Alright, I had to raid three nurses' stations to get these."
5,11,SAM,"They're only silver-plated, but they should work."
5,11,DEAN,"Oh, no, no, no. Not today, sweetheart. Come on, keep walking. I..."
5,11,WENDY,I want him now. (looks at DEAN) He's larger.
5,11,DEAN,Hm. (shrugs at SAM) You've had worse.
5,11,SAM,"Fuller is on call tonight, so we'll have to hit him after lights out. All three of us."
5,11,MARTIN,What? No.
5,11,DEAN,"Martin, we gotta get past security, past the orderlies, and then cut the boss-man's throat, okay? It's gonna suck start to finish, but we could use the backup."
5,11,MARTIN,"Oh, I can't. I can't."
5,11,SAM,We know what happened in Albuquerque.
5,11,MARTIN,"(stops) You don't know the half of it. (turns to them) God, I used to be just like you two. I used to think I was invincible, and then...Well, I found out I'm not."
5,11,DEAN,"Martin, you're still a hunter."
5,11,MARTIN,"No. I'm not. I'm useless. Why do you think I checked myself into the Hotel California? I'd give anything to help you boys, I would. But, I-I can't. I'm sorry. I can't."
5,11,DEAN,He's still in the building. You take the west wing. I'll take the east.
5,11,MARTIN,No! No! Look at his arm. That cut's not burning.
5,11,MARTIN,It's not him. It's not him.
5,11,DEAN,You okay?
5,11,DEAN,They give you something?
5,11,SAM,"Oh, yeah. They gave me...everything. It's spectacu-lacular. (laughs)"
5,11,DEAN,You always were a happy drunk.
5,11,SAM,Dean...the doctor...wasn't a wraith.
5,11,DEAN,I know.
5,11,DEAN,"I don't understand it. I mean, I saw it in the mirror. It wasn't human."
5,11,SAM,Or you're seeing things. Maybe-maybe-maybe you're going crazy.
5,11,DEAN,I'm not crazy.
5,11,DEAN,"I made a mistake, that's all. I'll find the thing."
5,11,SAM,"Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I know."
5,11,SAM,"It's okay. Hey, hey. Look at me."
5,11,SAM,It's okay...because you're my brother...and I still love ya.
5,11,SAM,Bop!
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,You missed our session today.
5,11,DEAN,A little busy.
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,Still hunting that wraith?
5,11,DEAN,People are dying.
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,People die all the time.
5,11,DEAN,"Look, lady, why don't you just let me do my job, maybe save your life."
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,It's not my life that I'm worried about.
5,11,DEAN,"(exasperated) Oh, my G--I am fine, okay? (stops and turns towards her) I'm fine."
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,"Come on, even you don't believe that. All this pressure that you're putting yourself under, all this guilt; it's killing you. You can't save everybody. You can't. (her voice becomes hard) Hell, these days, you can't save anybody, Dean. (turns to leave)"
5,11,DEAN,What did you say?
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,"(turns back to him) The truth, Dean. You got Ellen and Jo killed. You shot Lucifer, but you couldn't gank him."
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,"You couldn't stop Sam from killing Lilith, and--oh, yeah--you broke the first seal. All you do is fail. Did you really think that you, Dean Winchester with a GED and a give-'em-hell attitude, were gonna beat the devil?"
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,"Please. The world is gonna burn, and there is nothing that you can do about it."
5,11,DEAN,Who are you? (voice rising) How do you know that stuff?
5,11,ORDERLY,"Hey, settle down."
5,11,DEAN,Tell me!
5,11,ORDERLY,"I said, settle down."
5,11,DEAN,(quietly) Who are you?
5,11,DEAN,(points at DR. CARTWRIGHT) Who is she?
5,11,ORDERLY,Who?
5,11,DEAN,"What are you, blind? (points again) Her!"
5,11,ORDERLY,"Pal, there's nobody there."
5,11,DR. CARTWRIGHT,"I'm not real, Dean. I'm in your head...because you are going crazy."
5,11,DEAN,Just leave me alone.
5,11,DR. FULLER,You asked to see me?
5,11,SAM,"Yeah. Thanks. I, um...I just wanted to apologize. I feel horrible about what I did to you. I thought you were a monster."
5,11,DR. FULLER,"I know that. The question is, why?"
5,11,SAM,"I was...It doesn't matter, um...because after what happened last night, I had a...moment of clarity. I realized...there's no such thing as monsters."
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Well, I'm glad to hear you say that, but, honestly? Monsters are the least of your problems. People can learn to live with delusions, but the anger I saw in you...You hurt those two men, and you were going to kill me. The look in your eyes when you came after me, I...It was like you were barely even human...like a man possessed."
5,11,SAM,(very ashamed and guilt-ridden) I know. Please...just...could you give me a second chance?
5,11,DR. FULLER,"Well, this isn't a prison. You'll be allowed to go to the day room, under supervision."
5,11,SAM,Thank you.
5,11,DR. FULLER,"(steps closer) But if there is one more outburst...I will transfer you to a facility that is equipped to handle violent patients. And, believe me, they will be far, far less forgiving."
5,11,SAM,Dean? Hey.
5,11,SAM,Oh. What's wrong?
5,11,DEAN,"(faces SAM) It's not the demon blood, Sam. It never was."
5,11,SAM,What?
5,11,DEAN,The problem was you. It was always you. The lies...your arrogance...the black spot on your soul.
5,11,FEMALE PATIENT,Now we're all gonna die because of you. It's all your fault.
5,11,MALE PATIENT,You killed all of us. Pathetic freak.
5,11,FEMALE PATIENT,You evil son of a bitch!
5,11,FEMALE PATIENT,Loser.
5,11,FEMALE PATIENT,Grow up and die!
5,11,FEMALE PATIENT,Freak!
5,11,SAM,Leave me alone!
5,11,SAM,Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
5,11,SAM,No! Stop it! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! I didn't do it! Get off of me!
5,11,SAM,Leave me alone! Get off! No! Leave me alone!
5,11,DEAN,(quietly) What's happening? What's happening?
5,11,DEAN,"(in a small voice) Martin, Martin, it's me. It's Dean."
5,11,MARTIN,"Oh, sorry."
5,11,MARTIN,"You--You look like hell, boy."
5,11,DEAN,"I-I feel like it, too."
5,11,MARTIN,Where's Sam?
5,11,DEAN,Lockdown! He went crazy! Thank God.
5,11,MARTIN,What?
5,11,DEAN,"I'm going crazy, too. I'm seeing things. I'm hearing things. I mean, we both are. Crazy is the clue."
5,11,MARTIN,What do you mean?
5,11,MARTIN,Dean!
5,11,DEAN,(jolts a little and looks back at MARTIN) Crazy is the clue.
5,11,MARTIN,You said that. What?
5,11,DEAN,"I mean, the things that me and Sam have done, the stuff that we've seen, we're gonna end up going guano eventually. Probably end up like a couple of drooling nut bags. (realizes what he's said) No offense."
5,11,MARTIN,None taken.
5,11,DEAN,"But me and him, freaking out on the same day? I mean, it's gotta be..."
5,11,MARTIN,The monster...
5,11,DEAN,"(freaks, looking around for it) What? Where? Where? (ducks down at the side of the bed)"
5,11,MARTIN,"No--It's not--No, there's nothing there."
5,11,DEAN,(crouching next to MARTIN'S bed) Okay. What if this thing doesn't just feed on the insane? What if it makes people insane? (begging for clarification from MARTIN) Is it possible? Does that seem real?
5,11,MARTIN,"Well, I'm not the most reliable source on what is real, but it sounds--It makes sense."
5,11,DEAN,"Okay. Okay. So-so we got infected. You know, something shot us up with crazy. You know, something... (begins to realize something) Maybe...maybe it's the ghost of my dad..."
5,11,MARTIN,"No. Focus on the wraith, Dean. Focus."
5,11,DEAN,"(realizes MARTIN is right) Right, the wraith, the wraith. (stands) Okay. So, the wraith, the wraith, it-it poisoned us. It--Yeah. Maybe with venom, you know? By-by touch...or-or venom, or saliva. (freezes, realizes) Wendy."
5,11,MARTIN,Wendy?
5,11,MARTIN,Dean?
5,11,DEAN,I can't step on the cracks.
5,11,DEAN,Is this real?
5,11,THE WRAITH,"Oh, it is, Sugar. It's very real."
5,11,MARTIN,She's still alive.
5,11,THE WRAITH,There's two patients in Wendy's room. They attacked me.
5,11,MARTIN,Dean? Can you hear me? Dean!
5,11,MARTIN,You've gotta get out there and kill that thing. I'll take care of her.
5,11,DEAN,(shakes his head) I can't.
5,11,MARTIN,"You have to. You have no choice, son."
5,11,MARTIN,"Go. Dean, run! Run!"
5,11,SAM,Hey! Let me go!
5,11,THE WRAITH,No. You are far too angry to be out there in the real world.
5,11,SAM,You.
5,11,THE WRAITH,"Of course, it's me. (looks back at SAM) I gotta say, you hunters don't exactly live up to your rep. (circles the bed) I mean, Martin's a wreck. He's harmless."
5,11,THE WRAITH,"And you and your brother come in here, talking tough about killing monsters...kind of made you easy to spot. Then all it took was a touch..."
5,11,THE WRAITH,"...and you were mine. Oh, I love it in here. (kneels down at the head of the bed) This place is my own personal five-star restaurant."
5,11,THE WRAITH,"Crazy brains. (trails another finger across his forehead) They get soaked in dopamine and adrenaline and all sorts of hormones and chemicals that make them...delicious. (licks her finger off) And the crazier they are, the better they taste."
5,11,SAM,You did this to me!
5,11,THE WRAITH,"Well, I helped. But that rage? No, no, no. That's all you. (stands, walks to the side of the bed) I don't make crazy. I just crank up what's already there."
5,11,THE WRAITH,"You build your own hell, but I give you the Legos. And when you're ripe..."
5,11,THE WRAITH,...I make all of your problems disappear.
5,11,DEAN,You get away from him.
5,11,THE WRAITH,"(stands to face DEAN) Do you really think this is gonna end well for you, kiddo?"
5,11,DEAN,"No. (takes out a silver blade) But I'm crazy, (smiling crazily) so, what the hell?"
5,11,SAM,(watching DEAN warily) You still crazy?
5,11,DEAN,(turns to SAM) Not any more than usual.
5,11,DEAN,We gotta get out of here.
5,11,SAM,Yeah.
5,11,DEAN,"Well, looks like Tom Cruise was right. Shrinks suck."
5,11,DEAN,What are you doing? Sam? You okay?
5,11,SAM,No. No. The wraith--
5,11,DEAN,What about her?
5,11,SAM,She was right.
5,11,DEAN,"No, she wasn't. She's dead, okay? Let's hit the road. I need a drink, or twelve."
5,11,DEAN,Stop. Stop it. So what if you are? What are you gonna do? You gonna take a leave of absence? You gonna say yes to Lucifer? What?
5,11,SAM,"No, of course not. I--"
5,11,DEAN,"Exactly. And that's exactly what you're gonna do. You're gonna take all that crap and you're gonna bury it. You're gonna forget about it, because that's how we keep going! That's how we don't end up like Martin! Are you with me?"
5,11,DEAN,"Come on, man. Are you with me?"
5,11,SAM,I'm with you.
5,11,DEAN,Good. Let's get the hell out of here.
5,12,SAM,"Evening, barkeep.  I would like to purchase some alcohol, please."
5,12,BARTENDER,"Uh-huh, what can I get you?"
5,12,SAM,"[holding up I.D.] Well, I’m 26. As you can see. From my license."
5,12,BARTENDER,Congratulations. What can I get you?
5,12,SAM,"A banana daiquiri, my good man. [SAM looks very pleased.]"
5,12,WOMAN,[smiling at SAM] I’m Crystal. What’s your name?
5,12,SAM,"Hi, Crystal. [He holds out his hand and they shake.] I’m Gary."
5,12,CRYSTAL,"Gary, I don’t want to embarrass you, but you are just – you are just a stunning-looking man."
5,12,SAM,"I know, right? [He pushes his hair behind his ears.]"
5,12,SAM,Ooh! Thanks.
5,12,CRYSTAL,"So Gary, are you having a good time tonight?"
5,12,SAM,"Mmm! [slurping on the daiquiri] Thank you for asking, Crystal – this is like the best night ever."
5,12,CRYSTAL,Do you think we could make it any better?
5,12,SAM,[shrugs] Probably. I don’t know!
5,12,CRYSTAL,"I mean, do you want to get out of here?"
5,12,SAM,"Well, I kind of like this bar. And I just ordered this daiquiri."
5,12,CRYSTAL,"I mean, do you want to get out of here with me?"
5,12,SAM,[looking around and then whispering] Are we talking about sex?
5,12,CRYSTAL,"Well, I, uh – [laughs] Yeah. I suppose we are."
5,12,SAM,"[inhales sharply] Crystal, I would love to have the sex with you."
5,12,CRYSTAL,[chuckles] Great. Then let's go.
5,12,CRYSTAL,"Love that jacket on you, by the way."
5,12,WOMAN’S VOICE,Dean and Sammy Winchester.
5,12,WOMAN,"So, how long has it been?"
5,12,SAM,The summer before 6th grade.
5,12,WOMAN,"Mmm, I remember. You assigned yourself your own reading list."
5,12,DEAN,[chuckling] That’s right. I forgot about that.
5,12,SAM,[to the TEENAGE GIRL] Your mom happens to be the best babysitter we ever had.
5,12,WOMAN,"Well, when I was a maid at the Mayflower, out on the interstate – long before you were even an idea – their daddy used to pass through town and leave the boys with me while he went off to... work. One time, he was gone for two weeks."
5,12,TEENAGE GIRL,Two weeks?
5,12,WOMAN,"Mm-hmm. Oh, he'd always come limping back. He loved you boys."
5,12,TEENAGE GIRL,Did you know what he did all that time?
5,12,WOMAN,"Little Sammy kept trying to tell me. Of course, I didn't believe him. Not at first, anyway."
5,12,SAM,"Katie, our dad, um, happened to be an expert at getting rid of ghosts. And now, so are we."
5,12,WOMAN,"That's why I called them, sweetie. They can help us."
5,12,DEAN,Sounds like you guys got yourself a poltergeist.
5,12,MAN,Started a month or two after we moved in.
5,12,DONNA,"Yeah, first it was, uh, just bumps and knocks and scratches on the walls. And then it started breaking things."
5,12,SAM,And then it attacked Katie?
5,12,MAN,That was two nights ago.
5,12,WOMAN,"Can you show them, honey?"
5,12,SAM,“Murdered Chylde.”
5,12,DEAN,"Katie, everything's gonna be fine. I promise. Why don't you guys take yourselves a little vacation, and, uh, we'll take care of it."
5,12,DONNA,[sighs] Thank you.
5,12,GARY,"Uh, bacon burger turbo, large chilli-cheese fry, uh, and a Health Quake Salad shake?"
5,12,DEAN,"I know. I know. It's, uh… [clears throat] it's not mine."
5,12,DEAN,"Oh, you shake it up, baby. You know, poltergeist aside, Donna looked pretty good, don't you think?"
5,12,SAM,"Dude, don't tell me you've still got the hots for our babysitter."
5,12,DEAN,"What? No. That's weird.  [chuckles] I'm just saying that she, you know, she – she's – she's doing good. You know, with her husband, her kid. This whole Amityville thing being thrown at them, and they're hanging tough."
5,12,SAM,Yeah.
5,12,DEAN,"You ever think that you'd want something like that? Wife, rugrats, the whole nine?"
5,12,SAM,"[shakes his head ] No, not really my thing anymore."
5,12,DEAN,Yeah. What do you got?
5,12,SAM,"Uh, well, that house of theirs, it's old – really old. Um, hundreds of years. And I found a legend. It’s unconfirmed, but still."
5,12,DEAN,Saying?
5,12,SAM,"Supposedly, in the 1720s, the house was owned by a guy named Isaiah Pickett. [He turns his laptop to show DEAN a site titled “Witchcraft.”] Legend has it he hung a woman in his backyard for witchcraft – a woman named Maggie Briggs."
5,12,DEAN,"Okay, so an angry ghost witch?"
5,12,SAM,"If it's true. [The camera focuses on GARY, who is staring at them.] That still doesn't explain what ""Murdered Chylde"" means."
5,12,DEAN,"No, or where the bitch is buried."
5,12,SAM,"You know, I mean, it's a long way back, but I can see if I can find something in the town records."
5,12,DEAN,It's worth a shot.
5,12,MANAGER,Gary! Curly fries are up!
5,12,SAM,"Bupkis. Can't even find proof a woman named Maggie Briggs existed, much less where she was planted."
5,12,DEAN,"All right. Well, we've got a minute to breathe here, so, uh, let's pick it up first thing."
5,12,SAM,"Yeah, you bet. See you in a few."
5,12,SAM,Aah! What...
5,12,CUT TO,
5,12,CUT TO,
5,12,POLICE OFFICER,"[on radio] Yeah, this is Collins out on Route 30. I think we got him."
5,12,SAM,Who?
5,12,OFFICER COLLINS,"Your family's worried sick about you, son."
5,12,SAM,My – my family? My brother called you?
5,12,OFFICER COLLINS,"Come on, get in before you freeze solid."
5,12,SAM,"Thanks, uh, but, uh, w-where are we?"
5,12,OFFICER COLLINS,"You're home, son."
5,12,SAM,"N-no, officer, I-I'm not staying here."
5,12,GARY’S MOM,"Gary! Oh, my God! Gary! Oh, God! Gary! [She hugs him.]"
5,12,SAM,"Oh, hey! Hey! Hey!"
5,12,GARY’S MOM,Are you all right?
5,12,SAM,"Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Um, w-what's going on here?"
5,12,GARY’S MOM,What do you mean?
5,12,SAM,"Lady, who are you?"
5,12,GARY’S DAD,"Young man, are you drunk?"
5,12,SAM,And who are you?
5,12,GARY’S MOM,"Gary, are you drunk? Answer your father."
5,12,SAM,"My father? Look… [SAM sees GARY’s reflection, rather than his own, in the police car window]  Who is that?! Who the hell is that?!"
5,12,GARY’S DAD,"He's out of his gourd. Young man, I'm very surprised at you."
5,12,SAM,Yeah. Tell me about it.
5,12,SAM,"[in GARY's voice] Oh, yeah. Bring it!"
5,12,GARY,Holy crap.
5,12,DEAN,"Sam. Where the hell you been, man? I've been trying to call you for hours."
5,12,GARY,"I picked up some food. Bacon burger turbo, large chilli-cheese fry, right? Sorry, man. Really.  I-I just – I lost track of time. I didn't mean to freak you out."
5,12,DEAN,"Thanks. Don't know why it took you two hours, but thanks."
5,12,GARY,"Oh, you're gonna want to eat that on the road."
5,12,DEAN,Why?
5,12,GARY,"The maid came in, saw that [the camera pans to weapons laid out for cleaning], and now they're all kind of freaking out."
5,12,DEAN,Why'd you let the maid in?
5,12,GARY,It just happened.
5,12,DEAN,"Whatever. I got to hit the head, and then we'll take off."
5,12,GARY,All right. I-I’ll be outside.
5,12,CUT TO,
5,12,DEAN,Hey. You ready?
5,12,GARY,"Absolutely. [DEAN gets in.] Hey, can I drive?"
5,12,GARY,"Oh, this is so sweet! [He revs the engine.]"
5,12,DEAN,"You want to get the lead out, Andretti? Come on. [GARY puts the car into gear.] Reverse. Reverse!"
5,12,DEAN,It's in reverse.
5,12,GARY,"I am really, really sorry."
5,12,DEAN,Shut up.
5,12,CUT TO,
5,12,DEAN’S VOICE,"This is Dean's other, other cell, so you must know what to do."
5,12,SAM,"Dean, I've called every phone we got. Where are you, man? [We see GARY’s body reflected in the mirror.] So, this is gonna sound crazy, really crazy, but, um – I think I'm in the wrong body.  [chuckles nervously] Could use a little help here. I-I think I got asthma. Call me back."
5,12,MAN’S VOICE,Lucky Star Motel.
5,12,SAM,"Hello, uh, could you please connect me to room 102?"
5,12,MAN,"102? Uh, nah, man, those guys checked out middle of the night."
5,12,SAM,"Wait – ""guys""? Plural?"
5,12,MAN,"Yeah – uh, one leather jacket, one Sasquatch. They left."
5,12,SAM,"Smart kid. [He takes a Star Wars Darth Vader t-shirt off the clothes rack and sighs.] Virgin. [He opens a box he found under the bed, which contains a Busty Asian Beauties magazine.] Frustrated virgin. [He finds a black dagger and a black cloth with a pentagram.] Witchcraft, huh, Gary? You little Satanic bastard."
5,12,GARY’S MOM,[calling from downstairs] Gary! breakfast!
5,12,SAM,Leave me alone.
5,12,GARY’S MOM,Gary!
5,12,SAM,"All right, I'm coming!"
5,12,CUT TO,
5,12,GARY’S DAD,"So, Gary, I'd like to know what happened last night."
5,12,SAM,[exhales sharply] So would I. Believe me.
5,12,GARY’S DAD,"I mean, what happened with the plan, buddy?"
5,12,SAM,The plan?
5,12,GARY’S DAD,"S.A.T.s, M.I.T. – the plan. You want to be an engineer, you need a full ride. So, tell me, how does getting drunk fit with the plan?"
5,12,SAM,"Right, yeah. Listen, buddy, no offense, but at the moment, I could give a rat's ass about your plan."
5,12,GARY’S DAD,Excuse me?
5,12,SAM,"Uh… huh. Listen, h-have I seemed, uh, moody lately? Withdrawn?"
5,12,GARY’S SISTER,Wow.
5,12,SAM,Any – any occult fixations?
5,12,GARY’S MOM,What?
5,12,SAM,Let me guess – I'm amazing at Latin.
5,12,GARY’S MOM,You have an ear for languages.
5,12,SAM,"Hmm. Um, any of the neighbourhood pets go missing recently?"
5,12,GARY’S DAD,Are you smoking drugs?
5,12,GARY’S MOM,Leonard. He is not smoking drugs.
5,12,SAM,"Have any of you seen me w-w-with a book? It'd be big and old, uh, leather-bound, maybe some strange writing on it. Or [sighs] frankly, I'm probably hiding it."
5,12,GARY’S MOM,"Gary, no!"
5,12,SAM,W-what?
5,12,GARY’S MOM,You're allergic to wheat gluten.
5,12,CUT TO,
5,12,SAM,Gluten.
5,12,GARY’S SISTER,You've seriously sprung a leak.
5,12,SAM,What?
5,12,GARY’S SISTER,"If Mom and Dad ever found that creepy old book of yours, you'd be grounded for a decade. And you're bringing it up at breakfast?"
5,12,SAM,"So there is a book. Sydney, where do I keep it?"
5,12,GARY,"So, uh, where we going, anyway?"
5,12,DEAN,To work. The case?
5,12,GARY,"Oh, right. Yeah – the case. Of course. Where, uh, do you want to start?"
5,12,DEAN,"Well, since you couldn't find where Maggie Briggs was buried, now we have to do an all-day tombstone roll to see if we can dig her up."
5,12,GARY,"Wait. M-Maggie Briggs? You mean, like – like, the witch Maggie Briggs?"
5,12,DEAN,"Yeah, Sherlock."
5,12,GARY,"Yeah, she's in the basement."
5,12,DEAN,Come again? W-what basement?
5,12,GARY,"Isaiah Pickett’s house. Okay, there's this legend that he hung her, but he didn't. The real truth is that she was carrying his illegitimate child, and he killed her and then buried her in the basement."
5,12,DEAN,The murdered chylde. That would explain the scratches. How do you know all this?
5,12,GARY,"Oh, I've done all kinds of research on it. [DEAN looks at him in surprise.] I mean, you know, last night."
5,12,DEAN,Yeah. Nice work... I guess.
5,12,GARY,"Aw, man, turn it up!"
5,12,DEAN,Seriously?
5,12,GARY,Hell yeah!
5,12,TEENAGE BOY,Gary?
5,12,TEENAGE GIRL,Are you okay?
5,12,SAM,"Yeah, I'm Gary... Gary is okay."
5,12,TEENAGE BOY,So we're referring to ourselves in the third person now?
5,12,TEENAGE GIRL,We heard about last night. What happened?
5,12,SAM,"Got drunk. No big thing. Look, uh, what's my locker number?"
5,12,TEENAGE BOY,"What, are you – are you still drunk?"
5,12,SAM,"Yeah, yeah, I see, like, three of you right now. Um, so – so, what's my locker number?"
5,12,SAM,"Oh, no, Gary. [He sighs.] This is a very, very bad book."
5,12,GARYS,"Boo-yah! Master chief is in the house, bizatches!"
5,12,DEAN,Are you all right?
5,12,GARY,Yeah. Fine.
5,12,DEAN,"Well, I'll be damned. Willow moss."
5,12,GARY,"Yeah, right. It's, uh, supposed to grow over witches' graves, right?"
5,12,DEAN,[as if SAM should definitely know that] Yeah.
5,12,GARY,"Hey, man, I'm really sorry about this."
5,12,DEAN,Sorry about what?
5,12,DEAN,Sam! [He rushes to GARY and helps him up.] You okay?
5,12,GARY,Let's get the hell out of here!
5,12,DEAN,"Wait, wait, wait. We still got to burn the body, you idiot. Come on."
5,12,CUT TO,
5,12,GARY,"Dude, that was sweet!"
5,12,TEENAGE BOY,"Hey, Gary, wait up!"
5,12,TEENAGE GIRL,Where are you going?
5,12,SAM,I got something to do.
5,12,TEENAGE BOY,You're skipping class? You?
5,12,SAM,"I’m just… not feeling like myself, okay?"
5,12,TEENAGE BOY,"Well, whatever it is, we can talk it out, bro. Come with us."
5,12,SAM,I don't have time. I got to go. I'm sorry. [He turns away.]
5,12,TEENAGE BOY,Hey!
5,12,TEENAGE GIRL,Trevor!
5,12,TREVOR,"Well, what else was I supposed to do?"
5,12,WAITRESS,"Here you go, guys."
5,12,DEAN,"You know, do me a favor, sweetheart. Would you bring me a cheeseburger with extra bacon? And fry an egg on top of it, would you?"
5,12,WAITRESS,Absolutely.
5,12,GARY,"Ooh, that – that sounds good. Ditto."
5,12,WAITRESS,Be right back with your order.
5,12,DEAN,"Okay, who are you and what have you done with Sam?"
5,12,GARY,W-what do you mean?
5,12,DEAN,Bacon cheeseburgers now?
5,12,GARY,"I don't know. I eat them, don't I? Anyways, we are celebrating. [He lifts his glass in a toast.]"
5,12,DEAN,"Yeah, I guess. Another one bites the dust. Nice work today."
5,12,GARY,"You too. I had a, uh, really awesome day, man. Seriously. [He downs his drink.] Whoo! Sweet."
5,12,DEAN,A really awesome day?
5,12,GARY,Yeah. Why not?
5,12,DEAN,"It was a random, D-list ghost hunt. That’s – that's awesome to you?"
5,12,GARY,I can't be in a good mood?
5,12,DEAN,"Yeah, I guess, I just… No, actually. It's not really your style, Sam."
5,12,GARY,"Well, then, it's a new me. I mean, come on. Why shouldn't I be happy? I've got a gun, I'm getting drunk, and [he points his finger at his face] I look like this. [sighs] I don't know. You ever feel like your whole future is being decided for you?"
5,12,DEAN,"Uh, yeah, Sam, I feel like that a lot."
5,12,GARY,"No matter how much you fight it, you can't stop the plan. The stupid, stupid plan. So, I don't know. I guess it's, uh, it's just nice to do a little ass-kicking for a change, that's all. Uh, you know what? I – I'm drunk. [chuckles] Sorry. Just – just forget it."
5,12,DEAN,"No, no. It's all right. It’s, uh… I'll drink to that. [They clink glasses and drink.] Wow, you know, is it just me, or are we actually drinking together?"
5,12,GARY,"We don't do it that often, huh?"
5,12,DEAN,"[scoffs] Yeah, you could say that."
5,12,GARY,"Well, we should. You're a good guy, Dean."
5,12,DEAN,"Oh, you are drunk."
5,12,WAITRESS,Here you go.
5,12,DEAN,Mmm. Thank you.
5,12,WAITRESS,Enjoy.
5,12,GARY,"No, but I mean it. You really are a good guy. [He takes a bite of his burger.] Mmm! The bread alone! Mmm!"
5,12,CUT TO,
5,12,CRYSTAL,"Love that jacket on you, by the way."
5,12,GARY,"Thanks. Actually, the whole outfit is new."
5,12,GARY,We're gonna do it!
5,12,SAM,Hey! What the hell's going on?!
5,12,TREVOR,You can scream all you want. [loudly] No one can hear you! My parents are out of town!
5,12,TREVOR,Where are you?
5,12,GARY,"Uh, I can't really tell you right now, but, man, you wouldn't believe it."
5,12,TREVOR,"Well, where's Dean?"
5,12,GARY,"Uh, the Cloverleaf on Route 6. Why?"
5,12,TREVOR,You mean you haven't killed him yet?
5,12,SAM,"What? Wait, wait, wait, wait. W-what do you mean? Kill Dean?"
5,12,GARY,Building up to it.
5,12,TREVOR,"Look, Gary, we got problems here. For one, I'm looking at your body right now – with this other dude in it."
5,12,GARY,What?
5,12,TREVOR,"Yeah, he's been in your house. He's hanging out with your parents."
5,12,GARY,"Okay just... calm down. Whatever he says, no one's gonna believe him, right? I mean, w-we're still good."
5,12,TREVOR,"Would you just hurry up and kill the son of a bitch already, would you?"
5,12,GARY,Don't rush me. I'll do it.
5,12,TREVOR,"Yeah, you better."
5,12,GARY,"Got to go. [He hangs up. CRYSTAL smacks the whip on her palm.] Oh, man. I am in way over my head."
5,12,TREVOR,I don't think he's gonna do it.
5,12,TEENAGE GIRL,"Just relax, this is Gary we're talking about."
5,12,SAM,What the hell is going on here? How do you know who Dean is?
5,12,TREVOR,Everybody knows Dean. He’s Hell’s most wanted.
5,12,SAM,"Oh, no. No. Have you idiots been talking to demons?"
5,12,TREVOR,"Oh, right. We're the idiots."
5,12,SAM,[sighs] You're just kids. You have no idea what you're messing with.
5,12,TREVOR,"Well, we know that there's a price on Dean's head, and we're the ones that are gonna collect."
5,12,SAM,What's that supposed to mean?
5,12,TEENAGE GIRL,"About a month ago, we were down here –"
5,12,TREVOR,Nora.
5,12,NORA,"We’re not allowed to talk about him? We were down here, goofing around with that book."
5,12,TREVOR,"Um, I wouldn't exactly call praying to our dark overlord “goofing around.”"
5,12,NORA,"Don’t be a loser, Trev."
5,12,SAM,"Yeah, Trev."
5,12,NORA,"Anyway, all of a sudden, the lights flickered and Gary went into this weird trance. He closed his eyes, picked up a pencil, and drew this. [She shows SAM a drawing of DEAN.]"
5,12,TREVOR,And you know what's really weird? Gary can't draw.
5,12,NORA,He said he heard a voice in his head. The demons were putting out a bounty on this guy.
5,12,SAM,A bounty?
5,12,NORA,"Yeah, like, every witch or Satanist across the whole country. But Gary – Gary’s the one who spotted you."
5,12,SAM,"And the ""Freaky Friday"" crap?"
5,12,NORA,Another spell from the book. Gary's idea – go in Trojan horse-style. He's really smart.
5,12,TREVOR,"That is, if he has the beanbags to go through with it."
5,12,SAM,Listen to me. You are making a terrible mistake. We're talking about a demon deal – killing somebody. This isn't a game. You're crossing a line you won't come back from. Believe me.
5,12,TREVOR,What?
5,12,NORA,Nothing. I-I...
5,12,TREVOR,"Nora, don't tell me you're actually listening to this jerk."
5,12,NORA,"I don't know. M-maybe. I-I mean, what if he has a point?"
5,12,TREVOR,"I don't believe this. First Gary, now you. I can't – you know what? Fine. You want something done right..."
5,12,NORA,"What, you're gonna – you're gonna go kill Dean yourself, tough guy?"
5,12,TREVOR,Don't have to. I can do this. [He holds up the witchcraft book open to a page about demon summoning.]
5,12,NORA,"N-no, no. Y-you can't be serious."
5,12,TREVOR,"I'm calling up one of these bad boys, turning these punks over, and getting paid. Dolla, dolla bills, y'all!"
5,12,NORA,I-I really don't think that that's a good idea.
5,12,SAM,"It's not. It's a very, very bad idea."
5,12,TREVOR,No one asked you.
5,12,DEAN,You're not Sam. Who the hell are you?
5,12,GARY,Ow!
5,12,SAM,Don't do this. I'm begging you.
5,12,NORA,"Trevor, I think he's right."
5,12,TREVOR,"Hey, you want to get into Vassar, don't you?"
5,12,SAM,Please! Stop! [TREVOR commences the spell.] You're gonna get us all killed!
5,12,TREVOR,Ad ligandum eos pariter eos coram me! [Nothing seems to have happened.] Maybe I said it wrong. [He turns and sees NORA slumped on the floor.] Nora?
5,12,SAM,"No! No, no! Don't touch her!"
5,12,TREVOR,"Nora, you okay?"
5,12,NORA/DEMON,"Oh, yeah. I'm peachy."
5,12,NORA/DEMON,"So, what'd you call me here for, Skippy? Unless... it's dinnertime?"
5,12,TREVOR,"What? I-I... n-no. Uh, we have Dean Winchester."
5,12,NORA/DEMON,You do? Where?
5,12,SAM,"Trevor, keep your mouth shut."
5,12,TREVOR,The Cloverleaf Motel over on Route 6.
5,12,NORA/DEMON,"Sam? Is that you in there? [laughs] Well, aren't you just 98 pounds of nothing."
5,12,SAM,The kid is a moron. He doesn't have any idea where Dean is.
5,12,NORA/DEMON,"[laughs] So, if Sam’s in this body, who's in Sam’s?"
5,12,TREVOR,A dangerous warlock. Named Gary.
5,12,NORA/DEMON,You mean to tell me you've got Dean Winchester and Sam Winchester's meat suit? An empty vessel just waiting to be filled. And you're handing them both over to me?
5,12,TREVOR,"Uh, y-yeah. I guess."
5,12,NORA/DEMON,Well... I got to hand it to you. I'm impressed.
5,12,TREVOR,"Thanks. Um, so if you don't mind my asking... there's a reward?"
5,12,NORA/DEMON,Sure. My undying gratitude.
5,12,TREVOR,"[chuckles] What, are you serious?"
5,12,SAM,"Be quiet, you idiot!"
5,12,NORA/DEMON,"Consider yourself lucky, kid."
5,12,TREVOR,"[sighs] Um, wait a minute! We worked our asses off here, and, uh, I want my reward! [NORA/DEMON stares at him.] Please?"
5,12,NORA/DEMON,[chuckles] Okay. I'm sorry. You're right. What can I get you?
5,12,TREVOR,"Well, h-how about a million bucks?"
5,12,SAM,"Oh, for God's sake, Trevor, just shut up and run!"
5,12,NORA/DEMON,A million doesn't buy you much these days. Why not make it 10?
5,12,TREVOR,"Okay, $10 mill. And I want... I want Mindy Schwartz to fall in love with me."
5,12,NORA/DEMON,Love... money. [chuckles] Sticking to the basics. I can respect that. But here's my counter.
5,12,NORA/DEMON,Yep. Tastes like moron. [She smiles at SAM.]
5,12,SAM’S VOICE,"[beep] Uh, this is gonna sound crazy – really crazy – but I think, uh, I think I'm in the wrong body. [chuckles nervously] [beep] Dean, the guy right next to you is not me! [beep] Dean, check your friggin' voicemail. Damn it."
5,12,DEAN,"All right, pal. Either you start talking or I start water boarding."
5,12,GARY,"Oh, my God. Please, don't hurt me. Please! I'm sorry! I'm so, so sorry!"
5,12,DEAN,"Hey, pull it together, champ."
5,12,GARY,I don't want to die. I don't want to die.
5,12,DEAN,Where's Sam?
5,12,GARY,In my – my friend's basement. His parents are out of town.
5,12,DEAN,Parents? How old are you?
5,12,GARY,17.
5,12,DEAN,17? Huh.
5,12,GARY,Nora?
5,12,NORA/DEMON,Not at the moment.
5,12,SAM,[grunting] Whew! [breathing heavily] Damn it!
5,12,NORA/DEMON,"Boy, you earned your dessert tonight, kiddo. Tell me – what is it you want? Anything."
5,12,GARY,Anything?
5,12,NORA/DEMON,Lay it on me.
5,12,GARY,I want to be a witch. For real. And really powerful.
5,12,NORA/DEMON,"Mm. Good choice. I get it. No daddy, no M.I.T. No plan. You get to be big and strong, and no one can tell you what to do anymore. There's just one small formality first. You got to meet the boss."
5,12,GARY,The boss?
5,12,NORA/DEMON,"You know – your Satanic majesty, or whatever the kids are calling it these days."
5,12,GARY,The devil?
5,12,NORA/DEMON,Mm-hmm.
5,12,GARY,"Uh... no. O-okay. Um, it's okay. I... don't really want to bother him."
5,12,NORA/DEMON,"Oh, but he's gonna want to meet you. Relax. It'll be easy. He's just gonna ask you one little question, and all you got to do is say “yes”. And then, you get your reward."
5,12,GARY,"Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus."
5,12,NORA/DEMON,What was that?
5,12,GARY,"Uh, n-nothing."
5,12,NORA/DEMON,Were you trying exorcize me?! You little piece of crap! [She grabs GARY by the throat and lifts him off the ground.]
5,12,DEAN,"Spiritus, omnis satanica potestas."
5,12,GARY,Omnis incursio infernalis adversii.
5,12,DEAN,Omnis congregatio.
5,12,GARY,Et secta diabolica.
5,12,DEAN,"Ergo, draco maledicte."
5,12,GARY,Ecclesiam tuam securi tibi facias libertate servire.
5,12,DEAN,"Te rogamus. Adios, bitch!"
5,12,GARY,"Uh, it’s ""adinos.”"
5,12,NORA/DEMON,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
5,12,GARY,"Animae domum redeant. Fas atque nefas instauretur. Potestate et auctoritate, sic fiat."
5,12,DEAN,"So, we good?"
5,12,SAM,"Yeah. We're good. Oh, man, it's nice to be back."
5,12,GARY,Yeah. Awesome.
5,12,DEAN,So… [clears throat] Gary.
5,12,GARY,I know – my bad.
5,12,DEAN,"""My bad""? Kid, ""my bad"" ain't gonna cut it. See, if you were of voting age... you'd be dead. Because we would kill you. So either you straighten up and fly right or we will kill you. Are we clear?"
5,12,GARY,Crystal.
5,12,DEAN,Good.
5,12,GARY,Crap.
5,12,SAM,"Gary, take it from someone who knows – chin up, man. Your life ain't that bad."
5,12,GARY,"Uh, you met my parents."
5,12,SAM,"Yeah. So what? It's your life. You don't like their plan for you, tell them to cram it. Rebel a little bit. In a healthy, non-Satanic way, of course. By the way, you know why Nora’s into witchcraft?"
5,12,GARY,What do you mean?
5,12,SAM,"She doesn't like Satan, you moron. She likes you."
5,12,GARY,Really?  You think?
5,12,SAM,"Yeah, I know. I'm telling you, kid – I wish I had your life."
5,12,GARY,You do? Thanks.
5,12,SAM,Get out of here.
5,12,DEAN,That was a nice thing to say.
5,12,SAM,"I totally lied. That kid's life sucked ass. [SAM and DEAN get into the IMPALA.] All that apple-pie, family crap? It's stressful. Trust me – we didn't miss a damn thing."
5,12,DEAN,Or we don't know what we're missing.
5,12,SAM,"Oh, come on, man. Turn it down. [DEAN does so.]"
5,12,DEAN,"Welcome back, Kotter."
5,13,ANNA,I remember now. I'm an angel.
5,13,CASTIEL,You really shouldn't have come.
5,13,CASTIEL,You have to stop it.
5,13,DEAN,Stop what?
5,13,DEAN,Mom?
5,13,JOHN,John Winchester.
5,13,DEAN,"My parents are Mary and John Winchester, and I am your grandson."
5,13,DEAN,No!
5,13,CASTIEL,"Destiny can't be changed, Dean. All roads lead to the same destination."
5,13,DEAN,"Oh, I take it all back. I love the devil."
5,13,DEAN,"Now, that's what I call peace on earth."
5,13,DEAN,Anna?
5,13,DEAN,"I was just, uh, working on a case."
5,13,ANNA,This is what you dream about.
5,13,DEAN,This is awkward. Why are you gate-crashing my head? Why don't you just swing by the motel?
5,13,ANNA,I can't find you.
5,13,DEAN,Oh. Cas did this thing.
5,13,ANNA,"Cas. Right. Now, there's a friend you can count on."
5,13,DEAN,What?
5,13,ANNA,He didn't tell you?
5,13,DEAN,Tell me what?
5,13,ANNA,Where I've been. Of course not. Why would he?
5,13,DEAN,Where have you been?
5,13,ANNA,"Prison. Upstairs. All the torture, twice the self-righteousness."
5,13,DEAN,Why wouldn't he have told us where you were?
5,13,ANNA,Because he's the one who turned me in. Don't look so shocked. He was always a good little soldier. Did anything under orders.
5,13,DEAN,I didn't know. Are you okay?
5,13,ANNA,No. And I don't have long. I broke out. Barely. They're looking for me. If they find me—
5,13,DEAN,Okay. What do you need?
5,13,ANNA,"Meet me. Two-two-five Industrial. And, please, just—"
5,13,ANNA,Hurry.
5,13,ANNA,Hello? Who's there?
5,13,CASTIEL,"Hello, Anna."
5,13,ANNA,Well. If I didn't know any better...
5,13,ANNA,I'd say the Winchesters don't trust me.
5,13,CASTIEL,They do. I don't. I wouldn't let them come.
5,13,ANNA,And why is that?
5,13,CASTIEL,"If you're out of prison, it's because they let you out. And they sent you here to do their dirty work."
5,13,ANNA,And what makes you so sure?
5,13,CASTIEL,Because I've experienced...heaven's persuasion.
5,13,ANNA,You mean when you gave me to them.
5,13,CASTIEL,That was a mistake.
5,13,CASTIEL,"Anna, whatever they sent you here to do—"
5,13,ANNA,They didn't send me. I escaped.
5,13,CASTIEL,No one escapes.
5,13,ANNA,"All these centuries, and you're underestimating me now?"
5,13,CASTIEL,"If you're not one of them, then what do you want?"
5,13,ANNA,I want to help.
5,13,CASTIEL,You want to help?
5,13,ANNA,Yes.
5,13,CASTIEL,Then what are doing with that knife?
5,13,ANNA,I'm not allowed to defend myself?
5,13,CASTIEL,Against whom? That blade doesn't work against angels. It's not like this one.
5,13,CASTIEL,Maybe you're not working for Heaven. But there's something you're not telling me.
5,13,ANNA,Sam Winchester has to die.
5,13,ANNA,I'm sorry but we have no choice. He's Lucifer's vessel.
5,13,CASTIEL,He's not the only one.
5,13,ANNA,"What, that guy Nick?"
5,13,ANNA,He's burning away as we speak. No.
5,13,ANNA,"Sam is the only vessel that matters. You know what that means? If Lucifer can't take Sam, his whole plan short-circuits. No fight with Michael, no Croatoan virus."
5,13,ANNA,The Horsemen go back to their day jobs.
5,13,CASTIEL,"Even if you could...kill Sam, Satan would just bring him back to life."
5,13,ANNA,Not after I scatter his cells across the universe.
5,13,ANNA,They'll never find him. Not all of him.
5,13,CASTIEL,We'll find another way.
5,13,ANNA,How's that going?
5,13,ANNA,"How's the Colt working out? Or the search for God? Is anything working? If you want to stop the devil, this is how."
5,13,CASTIEL,The answer's still no. Because Sam is my friend.
5,13,ANNA,You've changed.
5,13,CASTIEL,"Maybe too late, but I have."
5,13,CASTIEL,"Anna, we've been through much together, but you come near Sam Winchester and I'll kill you."
5,13,YOUNG MAN,Oh my God!
5,13,YOUNG MAN,Hey.
5,13,YOUNG WOMAN,Oh my God.
5,13,YOUNG MAN,Hey. Are you okay?
5,13,YOUNG WOMAN,We have to get her to a hospital.
5,13,DEAN,Really? Anna? I don't believe it.
5,13,CASTIEL,It's true.
5,13,DEAN,"So she's gone all Glenn Close, huh? That's awesome."
5,13,CASTIEL,Who's Glenn Close?
5,13,DEAN,"No one, just this psycho bitch who likes to boil rabbits."
5,13,SAM,"So the plan to kill me, would it actually stop Satan?"
5,13,DEAN,"No, Sam, come on."
5,13,SAM,"Cas, what do you think? Does Anna have a point?"
5,13,CASTIEL,"No. She's, uh, Glenn Close."
5,13,DEAN,I don't get it. We're looking for the chick that wants to gank Sam.
5,13,DEAN,Why poke the bear?
5,13,CASTIEL,Anna will keep trying. She won't give up until Sam is dead. So we kill her first.
5,13,CASTIEL,Zod ah ma ra la—
5,13,CASTIEL,—ee est la gi ro sa.
5,13,CASTIEL,I've found her.
5,13,DEAN,Where is she?
5,13,CASTIEL,Not where. When.
5,13,CASTIEL,It's nineteen seventy-eight.
5,13,SAM,What?
5,13,SAM,Why nineteen seventy-eight? I wasn't even born yet.
5,13,CASTIEL,You won't be if she kills your parents.
5,13,SAM,What?
5,13,CASTIEL,Anna can't get to you because of me. So she's going after them.
5,13,DEAN,Take us back right now.
5,13,CASTIEL,And deliver you right to Anna? I should go alone.
5,13,DEAN,"They're our parents. Cas, we're going."
5,13,CASTIEL,It's not that easy.
5,13,SAM,Why not?
5,13,CASTIEL,Time travel was difficult even with the powers of heaven at my disposal.
5,13,SAM,Which got cut off.
5,13,DEAN,"So, what, you're like a Delorean without enough plutonium?"
5,13,CASTIEL,"I don't understand that reference. But I'm telling you, taking this trip, with passengers no less—"
5,13,CASTIEL,—it'll weaken me.
5,13,DEAN,"They're our mom and dad. If we can save them, and not just from Anna... I mean if we can set things right, we have to try."
5,13,CASTIEL,Ready?
5,13,SAM,Not really.
5,13,DEAN,Bend your knees.
5,13,DRIVER,Get out of the street!
5,13,SAM,Did we make it?
5,13,DEAN,"Unless they're bringing Pintos back into production, I, uh, I'd say yes."
5,13,SAM,Cas?
5,13,DEAN,Hey.
5,13,SAM,"Hey, hey, hey."
5,13,DEAN,Take it easy. Take it easy. Are you all right?
5,13,CASTIEL,I'm fine. I'm much better than I expected.
5,13,SAM,Cas?
5,13,SAM,He's breathing. Sort of. What do we do?
5,13,SAM,"I mean, the mustaches alone..."
5,13,DEAN,"So I paid for Cas for five nights up in the, uh, honeymoon suite. I told the manager, 'Do not disturb no matter what.' You know what he said to me? 'Yeah. Don't sweat it. Want to buy some dope?'"
5,13,DEAN,"Dope. We ought to stick around here, buy some stock in Microsoft."
5,13,SAM,"Yeah, we might have to if Cas doesn't recover. Is he all right?"
5,13,DEAN,"What do I look like—Dr. Angel, Medicine Woman? He'll wake up. He's, you know, tough for a little nerdy dude with wings."
5,13,SAM,"If he landed like that, hopefully, so did Anna. Should buy us some time."
5,13,DEAN,"So, did you find 'em?"
5,13,SAM,"Yeah. Uh, the Winchesters. Four-eight-five Robintree."
5,13,DEAN,Let's go pop in on the folks.
5,13,DEAN,"Sam. Sam. Wait, wait, wait, wait."
5,13,SAM,"Dean, Anna could be here any second."
5,13,DEAN,What exactly are we gonna march up there and tell 'em?
5,13,SAM,"Uh, the truth."
5,13,DEAN,"What, that their sons are back from the future to save them from an angel? Gone Terminator? Come on. Those movies haven't even come out yet."
5,13,SAM,"Well, then tell her demons are after 'em. I mean, she thinks you're a hunter, right?"
5,13,DEAN,"Yeah, a hunter who disappeared right when her dad died. She's gonna love me."
5,13,DEAN,Just follow my lead.
5,13,MARY,How was work?
5,13,JOHN,"It was, uh, great."
5,13,MARY,Ah! Not until you wash up.
5,13,JOHN,I love when you get bossy.
5,13,DEAN,"Hi, Mary."
5,13,MARY,You can't be here.
5,13,DEAN,I'm sorry if this is a bad time.
5,13,MARY,You don't understand. I'm not—
5,13,MARY,I don't do that anymore. I have a normal life now. You have to go.
5,13,DEAN,"I'm sorry, but this is important, okay?"
5,13,MARY,"Sorry, sweetie, they're just..."
5,13,DEAN,Mary's cousins.
5,13,DEAN,"Yeah, we couldn't stop through town without swinging by and saying 'hey', now, could we?"
5,13,DEAN,Dean.
5,13,JOHN,You look familiar.
5,13,DEAN,"Really? Yeah, you do, too, actually, you know? We must have met sometime. Small towns, right? Got to love 'em."
5,13,JOHN,I'm John.
5,13,DEAN,This is Sam.
5,13,JOHN,"Sam. Uh, Mary's father was a Sam."
5,13,DEAN,"Uh, it's a—it's a family name."
5,13,JOHN,"You okay, pal? You look a little spooked."
5,13,SAM,"Oh. Oh, yeah. Just a...long trip."
5,13,DEAN,Yeah.
5,13,MARY,"Well, Sam and Dean were just on their way out."
5,13,JOHN,What? They just got here. Real happy to meet folks from Mary's side. Please come on in for a beer.
5,13,DEAN,Twist my arm.
5,13,JOHN,"Are you sure you're okay, Sam?"
5,13,SAM,"W—oh. Yeah, yeah. Um, I'm just, um—You are so beautiful."
5,13,DEAN,"He means that in a—a non-weird, wholesome, family kind of a way."
5,13,SAM,"Yeah, right."
5,13,DEAN,"We haven't seen Mary in—in quite some time, and—See, she's the spitting image of our mom. I mean, it's—it's—"
5,13,SAM,Eerie.
5,13,JOHN,"So, how are you guys related?"
5,13,DEAN,"You know, uh, distantly."
5,13,JOHN,Oh. So you knew Mary's parents?
5,13,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mary's dad was, uh, pretty much like a grandpa to us."
5,13,JOHN,Oh. That was tragic—that heart attack.
5,13,DEAN,"Yes, it was."
5,13,JOHN,"So, uh, what are you guys doing in town, anyway?"
5,13,DEAN,"Uh, business, you know."
5,13,JOHN,"Oh, yeah? What line of work?"
5,13,SAM,Plumbing.
5,13,DEAN,Scrap metal.
5,13,MARY,"Oh, gosh. It's almost seven. I hate to be rude, but I got to get dinner ready."
5,13,JOHN,Maybe they could stay.
5,13,MARY,I'm sure they have to leave.
5,13,JOHN,"Uh, look, please stay. You know, it would mean a lot to me. I haven't met much of Mary's side of the family."
5,13,JOHN,"Look, Mr. Woodson, I'm begging you to reconsider."
5,13,MR. WOODSON,"I'd like to, John. You're a great mechanic. But times ain't exactly rosy."
5,13,JOHN,E-even just part time. I really need this job.
5,13,MR. WOODSON,"All right, look. Come on in right now, let's talk. Maybe we can figure something out."
5,13,JOHN,You serious?
5,13,ANNA,I'll see you in ten minutes. Don't keep me waiting.
5,13,MARY,You have to leave. Now.
5,13,DEAN,"Okay, just listen—"
5,13,MARY,"No, you listen. Last time I saw you, a demon killed my parents. Now you waltz in here like you're family? Whatever you want—no. Leave me alone."
5,13,SAM,You and John are in danger.
5,13,MARY,What are you talking about?
5,13,DEAN,Something's coming for you.
5,13,MARY,Demon?
5,13,DEAN,Not exactly.
5,13,MARY,"Well, what, then?"
5,13,DEAN,"It's kind of hard to explain, okay? It's—it's—"
5,13,SAM,An angel.
5,13,MARY,What? There's no such thing.
5,13,DEAN,I wish. But they're twice as strong as demons. And bigger dicks.
5,13,MARY,Why would an angel want to kill us?
5,13,DEAN,"It's a long story, and we'll tell you the whole thing, but right now, you've got to trust us, and we got to go. Look at my face and tell me if I'm lying to you."
5,13,MARY,Okay. Where do we go?
5,13,DEAN,"Out of here. We got to move now, though."
5,13,MARY,Okay. But what do I tell John?
5,13,DEAN,Just tell him—
5,13,DEAN,John?
5,13,JOHN,Mr. Woodson? You still here?
5,13,DEAN,"I wish I could say it's good to see you, Anna."
5,13,ANNA,"You too, Dean."
5,13,ANNA,I'm sorry.
5,13,ANNA,Sorry. It's not that easy to kill an angel.
5,13,SAM,No.
5,13,SAM,But you can distract 'em.
5,13,JOHN,Monsters. Monsters?
5,13,MARY,Yes.
5,13,JOHN,Monsters are real.
5,13,MARY,"I'm sorry, I didn't know how—"
5,13,JOHN,And you fight them? All of you?
5,13,SAM,Yeah.
5,13,JOHN,How long?
5,13,MARY,"All my life. John, just try to understand—"
5,13,DEAN,She didn't exactly have a choice—
5,13,JOHN,"Shut up, all of you! Look, not another word, or so help me, I will turn this car around!"
5,13,DEAN,Wow. Awkward family road trip.
5,13,SAM,No kidding.
5,13,MARY,Place has been in the family for years.
5,13,MARY,"Devil's trap. Pure iron fixtures, of course."
5,13,MARY,"Um, there should be salt and holy water in the pantry, knives, guns."
5,13,SAM,All that stuff will do is piss it off.
5,13,MARY,"So, what will kill it? Or slow it down, at least?"
5,13,SAM,Not much.
5,13,MARY,Great.
5,13,DEAN,"He said not much, not nothing. We packed."
5,13,DEAN,If we put this up and she comes close—
5,13,DEAN,—we beam her right off the starship.
5,13,MARY,Mm.
5,13,SAM,"This is holy oil. It's kind of like a, like a devil's trap for angels.  Come on. I'll show you how it works."
5,13,JOHN,"Hey, what's the deal with the thing on the paper?"
5,13,DEAN,It's a sigil. That means—
5,13,JOHN,I don't care what it means. Where does it go?
5,13,DEAN,On a wall or a door.
5,13,JOHN,How big should I make it?
5,13,DEAN,John—
5,13,JOHN,"What? Y'all might have treated me like a fool, but I am not useless. I can draw a damn—"
5,13,JOHN,—whatever it is—a sigil.
5,13,DEAN,Why don't you go help Sam out? Okay? 'Cause this has got to be done in...it's got to be done in human blood.
5,13,JOHN,"So, how big?"
5,13,DEAN,I'll show you.
5,13,JOHN,What?
5,13,DEAN,"All of a sudden, you...you really remind me of my dad."
5,13,SAM,That's really good.
5,13,JOHN,You come to check on me?
5,13,SAM,Uh...I wanted to say I—I'm sorry about all this. I—I know it's a lot.
5,13,JOHN,"Look, how long have you known about this...hunting stuff?"
5,13,SAM,Pretty much forever. My dad raised me in it.
5,13,JOHN,You're serious? Who the hell does that to a kid?
5,13,SAM,"Well, I mean, for the record, Mary's parents did."
5,13,JOHN,"I don't care. You know, what kind of irresponsible bastard lets a child anywhere near—Y-you know, you could've been killed!"
5,13,SAM,"I, uh...came kind of close."
5,13,JOHN,The number it must've done on your head...Your father was supposed to protect you.
5,13,SAM,He was trying. He died trying. Believe me.
5,13,SAM,"I used to be mad at him. I—I mean, I used to... I used to hate the guy. But now I—I... I get it. He was...just doing the best he could."
5,13,SAM,"And he was trying to keep it together in—in—in this impossible situation. See... My mom, um... She was amazing, beautiful, and she was the love of his life. And she got killed. And...I think he would have gone crazy if he didn't do something. Truth is, um, my dad died before I got to tell him that I understand why he did what he did. And I forgive him for what it did to us. I do. And I just—I love him."
5,13,ANNA,Uriel.
5,13,ANNA,You look well.
5,13,URIEL,"You shouldn't have called. We're under strict orders not to come down here, much less take a vessel."
5,13,URIEL,You're not the Anna of now.
5,13,ANNA,"No, but thirty years from now, I'm still your superior. I need you to kill some humans."
5,13,URIEL,Always happy to do some smiting. But what's going on?
5,13,ANNA,"In the future, these people are going to kill you, Uriel. I'm giving you the chance to kill them first."
5,13,URIEL,Thank you.
5,13,MARY,Okay. You said you'd explain everything when we had a minute. We have a minute. Why does an angel want me dead?
5,13,DEAN,'Cause they're dicks.
5,13,MARY,"Not good enough. I didn't even know they existed, and now I'm a target?"
5,13,DEAN,It's complicated.
5,13,MARY,Fine.
5,13,MARY,All ears.
5,13,DEAN,"You're just gonna have to trust me, okay?"
5,13,MARY,I've been trusting you all day.
5,13,DEAN,It's kind of hard to believe.
5,13,MARY,"All right, then. I'm walking out the door."
5,13,DEAN,I'm your son.
5,13,MARY,What?
5,13,DEAN,"I'm your son. Sorry. I don't know how else to say it. We're from the year two thousand and ten. An angel zapped us back here. Not the one that attacked you, friendlier."
5,13,MARY,You can't expect me to believe that.
5,13,DEAN,"Our names are Dean and Sam Winchester. We're named after your parents. When I would get sick, you would make me tomato-rice soup, because that's what your mom made you. And instead of a lullaby, you would sing ""Hey Jude"", 'cause that's your favorite Beatles song."
5,13,MARY,I...I don't believe it. No.
5,13,DEAN,"I'm sorry, but it's true."
5,13,MARY,I raised my kids to be hunters?
5,13,DEAN,"No. No, you didn't."
5,13,MARY,How could I do that to you?
5,13,DEAN,You didn't do it. Because you're dead.
5,13,MARY,What? What happened?
5,13,DEAN,"Yellow-eyed demon. He killed you, and—"
5,13,DEAN,"John became a hunter to get revenge. He raised us in this life. Listen to me. A demon comes into Sam's nursery exactly six months after he's born. November second, nineteen eighty-three. Remember that date. And whatever you do, do not go in there. You wake up that morning and you take Sam and you run."
5,13,SAM,"That's not good enough, Dean."
5,13,SAM,"Wherever she goes, the demon's gonna find her. Find me."
5,13,DEAN,"Well, then what?"
5,13,SAM,She can leave Dad. That's what. You got to leave John.
5,13,MARY,What?
5,13,SAM,"When this is all over, walk away, and never look back."
5,13,DEAN,So we're never born.
5,13,DEAN,He's right.
5,13,MARY,"I—I can't. You're saying that you're my children, and now you're saying—"
5,13,DEAN,"You have no other choice. There's a big difference between dying and never being born. And trust me, we're okay with it, I promise you that."
5,13,MARY,"Okay, well, I'm not."
5,13,SAM,"Listen, you think you can have that normal life that you want so bad, but you can't. I'm sorry. It's all gonna go rotten. You are gonna die, and your children will be cursed."
5,13,MARY,There—there has to be a way.
5,13,SAM,"No, this is the way. Leave John."
5,13,MARY,I can't.
5,13,SAM,This is bigger than us. There are so many more lives at stake—
5,13,MARY,It's too late. I'm...I'm pregnant.
5,13,JOHN,"Hey, we got a problem. Those blood things, the sigils—they're gone."
5,13,SAM,Gone as in...
5,13,JOHN,"I drew one on the back of the door. I turned around. And when I looked back again, it was a smudge."
5,13,DEAN,He's right.
5,13,MARY,There's no more holy oil.
5,13,DEAN,Who the hell are you?
5,13,URIEL,I'm Uriel.
5,13,DEAN,"Oh, come on."
5,13,SAM,Go.
5,13,DEAN,Here goes nothin'.
5,13,MARY,John!
5,13,DEAN,Sammy!
5,13,DEAN,Sam!
5,13,ANNA,I'm really sorry.
5,13,JOHN,Anna.
5,13,ANNA,Michael.
5,13,URIEL,Michael. I didn't know.
5,13,MICHAEL,"Goodbye, Uriel."
5,13,MARY,What did you do to John?
5,13,MICHAEL,John is fine.
5,13,MARY,Who—what are you?
5,13,MICHAEL,Shh...
5,13,MICHAEL,"Well, I'd say this conversation is long overdue, wouldn't you?"
5,13,DEAN,Fix him.
5,13,MICHAEL,First...we talk. Then I fix your darling little Sammy.
5,13,DEAN,"How'd you get in my dad, anyway?"
5,13,MICHAEL,"I told him I could save his wife, and he said yes."
5,13,DEAN,I guess they oversold me being your one and only vessel.
5,13,MICHAEL,You're my true vessel but not my only one.
5,13,DEAN,What is that supposed to mean?
5,13,MICHAEL,It's a bloodline.
5,13,DEAN,A bloodline?
5,13,MICHAEL,"Stretching back to Cain and Abel. It's in your blood, your father's blood, your family's blood."
5,13,DEAN,Awesome. Six degrees of Heaven Bacon. What do you want with me?
5,13,MICHAEL,You really don't know the answer to that?
5,13,DEAN,"Well, you know I ain't gonna say yes, so why are you here? What do you want with me?!"
5,13,MICHAEL,I just want you to understand what you and I have to do.
5,13,DEAN,"Oh, I get it. You got beef with your brother. Well, get some therapy, pal. Don't take it out on my planet!"
5,13,MICHAEL,"You're wrong. Lucifer defied our father, and he betrayed me. But still...I don't want this any more than you would want to kill Sam."
5,13,MICHAEL,"You know, my brother, I practically raised him. I took care of him in a way most people could never understand, and I still love him."
5,13,MICHAEL,But I am going to kill him because it is right and I have to.
5,13,DEAN,"Oh, because God says so?"
5,13,MICHAEL,"Yes. From the beginning, he knew this was how it was going to end."
5,13,DEAN,And you're just gonna do whatever God says.
5,13,MICHAEL,"Yes, because I am a good son."
5,13,DEAN,"Okay, well, trust me, pal. Take it from someone who knows—that is a dead-end street."
5,13,MICHAEL,And you think you know better than my father? One unimportant little man. What makes you think you get to choose?
5,13,DEAN,Because I got to believe that I can choose what I do with my unimportant little life.
5,13,MICHAEL,You're wrong. You know how I know?
5,13,MICHAEL,"Think of a million random acts of chance that let John and Mary be born, to meet, to fall in love, to have the two of you. Think of the million random choices that you make, and yet how each and every one of them brings you closer to your destiny. Do you know why that is? Because it's not random. It's not chance. It's a plan that is playing itself out perfectly. Free will's an illusion, Dean. That's why you're going to say yes. Oh, buck up. It could be worse. You know, unlike my brothers, I won't leave you a drooling mess when I'm done wearing you."
5,13,DEAN,"Well, what about my dad?"
5,13,MICHAEL,"Better than new. In fact, I'm gonna do your mom and your dad a favor."
5,13,DEAN,What?
5,13,MICHAEL,Scrub their minds. They won't remember me or you.
5,13,DEAN,You can't do that.
5,13,MICHAEL,"I'm just giving your mother what she wants. She can go back to her husband, her family—"
5,13,DEAN,She's gonna walk right into that nursery!
5,13,MICHAEL,Obviously.
5,13,MICHAEL,And you always knew that was going to play out one way or another.
5,13,MICHAEL,You can't fight City Hall.
5,13,MICHAEL,"He's home. Safe and sound. Your turn. I'll see you soon, Dean."
5,13,SAM,Castiel.
5,13,SAM,"Hey. Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
5,13,DEAN,Cas!
5,13,SAM,We got you.
5,13,DEAN,You son of a bitch. You made it.
5,13,CASTIEL,I...I did? I'm very surprised.
5,13,SAM,Whoa! You're okay.
5,13,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
5,13,DEAN,Bed?
5,13,SAM,"Yeah, yeah."
5,13,DEAN,"Well, I could use that drink now."
5,13,SAM,Yeah.
5,13,DEAN,Well...this is it.
5,13,SAM,This is what?
5,13,DEAN,"Team Free Will. One ex-blood junkie, one dropout with six bucks to his name, and Mr. Comatose over there. It's awesome."
5,13,SAM,It's not funny.
5,13,DEAN,I'm not laughing.
5,13,SAM,They all say we'll say yes.
5,13,DEAN,I know. It's getting annoying.
5,13,SAM,What if they're right?
5,13,DEAN,They're not.
5,13,SAM,"I mean, why, why would we, either of us? But...I've been weak before."
5,13,DEAN,Sam.
5,13,SAM,Michael got Dad to say yes.
5,13,DEAN,That was different. Anna was about to kill Mom.
5,13,SAM,And if you could save Mom...what would you say?
5,13,JOHN,Where'd you even get it?
5,13,MARY,Garage sale. Twenty-five cents.
5,13,JOHN,"Well, I'm glad to hear that, anyway."
5,13,MARY,Hey.
5,13,JOHN,"I mean, you really don't think it's just a...little cheesy?"
5,13,MARY,Mm-mm. I think it's sweet.
5,13,MARY,Can't even put my finger on why I like it. I just...like it.
5,13,JOHN,"Well, then, I love it."
5,13,MARY,"Ohh...quite a kick there. Troublemaker already. It's okay, baby. It's all okay. Angels are watching over you."
5,16,BOBBY,"C’mon. How many times have you two died, anyway?"
5,16,DEAN,No!
5,16,CASTIEL,"There is someone, beside Michael, strong enough to take on Lucifer."
5,16,SAM,Who’s that?
5,16,CASTIEL,God. I’m going to find God.
5,16,BOBBY,What is it you want.
5,16,CASTIEL,An amulet. It burns hot in God’s presence. It will help me find him.
5,16,BOBBY,I’ve got nothing like that.
5,16,CASTIEL,You don’t. (looks at Dean; Dean looks at his amulet)
5,16,YOUNG DEAN,(holding the amulet) What is it?
5,16,YOUNG SAM,"Uncle Bobby gave it to me, said it was real special."
5,16,YOUNG DEAN,"Thank you, Sam. I love it."
5,16,CASTIEL,May I borrow it?
5,16,DEAN,No.
5,16,CASTIEL,Dean. Give it to me.
5,16,DEAN,(with emphasis) Don’t lose it.
5,16,ROY,Looking for this?
5,16,DEAN,Mornin’.
5,16,ROY,Shut up. Hands where I can see 'im.
5,16,DEAN,"Wait a minute. Is that you, Roy? It is, isn’t it. Which makes you Walt. Hiya Walt."
5,16,WALT,Don’t matter.
5,16,DEAN,"Well, is it just me, or do you two seem a tad upset?"
5,16,WALT,"You think you can flip the switch on the Apocalypse and just walk away, Sam?"
5,16,SAM,Who told you that?
5,16,WALT,We ain’t the only hunters after you. (Walt pumps his shotgun.) See you in the next life.
5,16,SAM,"Hear me out. I can explain, okay? Please."
5,16,ROY,(shifts to follow Dean’s movement) Stay the hell down.
5,16,WALT,Shoot 'im.
5,16,ROY,Killin’ Sam was right but Dean…
5,16,WALT,"He made us and we just snuffed his brother, you idiot. You want to spend the rest of your life knowing Dean Winchester’s on your ass, ‘cause I don’t. Shoot 'im."
5,16,DEAN,"Go ahead, Roy, do it. But I’m going warn you, when I come back I’m going to be pissed. C’mon! Let’s get this show on the road."
5,16,WALT,"Come on, already."
5,16,DEAN,Sammy?
5,16,SAM,"Come on, let’s go."
5,16,DEAN,Weird dream.
5,16,SAM,Got your lighter?
5,16,DEAN,"Whoa, I haven’t seen this in years."
5,16,SAM,Fire 'em up.
5,16,DEAN,"(smiling) I remember this! It’s Fourth of July, 1996."
5,16,SAM,"Dad would never let us do anything like this. Thanks, Dean. This is great."
5,16,SAM,Fire in the hole!
5,16,DEAN,Sam?
5,16,CASTIEL,(on radio) Dean!
5,16,DEAN,Cas?
5,16,CASTIEL,"(on radio) Yeah, it’s me."
5,16,DEAN,You gotta stop poking around in my dreams. I need some me time.
5,16,CASTIEL,(on radio) Listen to me very closely. This isn’t a dream.
5,16,DEAN,Then what is it?
5,16,CASTIEL,"(on radio) Deep down, you already know."
5,16,DEAN,I’m dead.
5,16,CASTIEL,(on radio) Condolences.
5,16,DEAN,Where am I?
5,16,CASTIEL,(on radio) Heaven.
5,16,DEAN,Heaven? How did I get to heaven?
5,16,CASTIEL,"(on radio) Please, listen. This spell, this connection, it’s difficult to maintain."
5,16,DEAN,"Wait. If I’m in heaven, then where’s Sam?"
5,16,CASTIEL,(on radio) What do you see?
5,16,DEAN,What do you mean ‘what do I see’?
5,16,CASTIEL,(on radio) Some people see a tunnel or a river. What do you see?
5,16,DEAN,Nothing. My dash. I’m in my car. I’m on a road.
5,16,CASTIEL,"(on radio) Alright. A road. For you it’s a road. Follow it, Dean. You’ll find Sam. (The radio is breaking up.) Follow the road. (The radio dies.)"
5,16,SAM,Thank you.
5,16,FATHER,"So, Sam. I hear you’re new to McKinley."
5,16,SAM,"Um, yes sir. Two weeks."
5,16,FATHER,Stephanie over here just can’t seem to stop talking about you.
5,16,STEPHANIE,"Dad, shut up."
5,16,SAM,Ummm.
5,16,DEAN,Wow. Just wow.
5,16,SAM,Dean? What are you doing in my dream?
5,16,FATHER,"So, what does your father do for a living? (pause for Sam’s response) Hm. You don’t say."
5,16,SAM,Heaven.
5,16,DEAN,Yup.
5,16,SAM,"Okay, how are we in heaven?"
5,16,DEAN,"All that clean living, I guess."
5,16,SAM,"No, no. Okay. You… I get, sure. But me? Maybe you haven’t noticed, but I’ve done a few things?"
5,16,DEAN,You thought you were doing the right thing.
5,16,SAM,"Last I checked, it wasn’t the road to heaven that was paved with good intentions."
5,16,DEAN,"Yeah, well, if this is the Skymall it sucks. I mean, where’s the triplets and the latex, you know? C’mon, a guy has needs."
5,16,SAM,"You know, when you bite the dust they say your life flashes before your eyes."
5,16,DEAN,Your point?
5,16,SAM,"This house, it’s one of my memories."
5,16,DEAN,"When I woke up, I woke up in one of my memories. The Fourth of July we burned down that field?"
5,16,DEAN,"Wait, so… playing footsie with brace-face in there? Then that’s a trophy moment for you?"
5,16,SAM,"Dean, I was eleven years old. This was my first real Thanksgiving."
5,16,DEAN,What are you talking about? We had Thanksgiving every year.
5,16,SAM,We had a bucket of extra-crispy and Dad passed out on the couch.
5,16,SAM,I don’t remember this.
5,16,DEAN,"Hey. (They look at the family) We should, uh…"
5,16,SAM,Definitely.
5,16,SAM,"Okay, what the hell was that?"
5,16,DEAN,"I don’t know, but we are taking the escalator back downstairs. (He hits the radio) Cas!"
5,16,SAM,What are you doing?
5,16,DEAN,What’s it look like?
5,16,SAM,Like you’ve lost your mind.
5,16,DEAN,"Cas talked to me before using this phone-home radio thing, so I— Cas!"
5,16,CASTIEL,(on TV) I can hear you.
5,16,DEAN,"Cas. Hey! So I, uh, I found Sam but, but something just happened. There was this weird beam of light."
5,16,CASTIEL,(on TV) Don’t go into the light.
5,16,DEAN,"Okay. Thanks, Carol Ann. What was it?"
5,16,CASTIEL,"(on TV) Not what, whom. Zachariah. He’s searching for you."
5,16,SAM,And if he finds us?
5,16,CASTIEL,"(on TV) You can’t say yes to Michael and Lucifer if you’re dead, so Zachariah needs to return you to your bodies."
5,16,SAM,Great! Problem solved.
5,16,CASTIEL,"(on TV) No. You don’t understand. You, hm. You’re behind the Wall. This is a rare opportunity."
5,16,DEAN,For what?
5,16,CASTIEL,(on TV) You need to find an angel. His name is Joshua.
5,16,DEAN,"Hey, man, no offense but we are kind of ass full of angels, okay. You find him."
5,16,CASTIEL,(on TV) I can’t. I can’t return to heaven.
5,16,SAM,So what’s so important about Joshua?
5,16,CASTIEL,"(on TV) The rumor is, he talks to God."
5,16,DEAN,"And, so?"
5,16,CASTIEL,(on TV) You think maybe—just maybe—we should find out what the hell God has been saying?
5,16,DEAN,Jeez. Touchy.
5,16,CASTIEL,(on TV) Please. I just need you to follow the road.
5,16,SAM,What road?
5,16,CASTIEL,"(on TV) It’s called the Axis Mundi. It’s a path that runs through heaven. Different people see it as different things. For you, it’s two-lane asphalt. The road will lead you to the Garden. You’ll find Joshua there. And Joshua… can take us to God. (The pictures starts to break up badly.) The Garden. Quick. Hurry."
5,16,SAM,So... What do you think?
5,16,DEAN,"I think we hit the yellow bricks, find this Joshua cat."
5,16,SAM,(looks surprised) Really?
5,16,DEAN,What? You don’t?
5,16,SAM,"No, uh. I’m just surprised you do. Last time I checked you wanted to break God’s nose, now you think he can help?"
5,16,DEAN,"He’s the only one who can. I mean, come on, Sam. We are royally boned. So prayer? The last hope of a desperate man."
5,16,SAM,Wasn’t there a street out here?
5,16,DEAN,There was.
5,16,SAM,Dean. What are you doing?
5,16,DEAN,Looking for a road.
5,16,SAM,You… (Dean opens the closet under the stairs) You think the road is in a closet?
5,16,DEAN,"(turns on the light) We’re in heaven, Sam, okay? I mean, our memories are coming true. Cas is on TV. Finding a road in a closet would be pretty much the most (he sees something on the floor) normal thing to happen to us today."
5,16,SAM,What?
5,16,DEAN,I used to have one of these… when I was a kid.
5,16,SAM,That was the road?
5,16,DEAN,I guess.
5,16,DEAN,"Kind of trippy, right?"
5,16,SAM,"Yeah. (Sam looks at Dean’s shirt.) More trippy. Um. Apparently, you ‘wuv hugs’."
5,16,DEAN,Shut up.
5,16,DEAN,Wait a minute. I know where we are.
5,16,SAM,Where?
5,16,DEAN,We’re home.
5,16,MARY,(off camera) Dean…
5,16,MARY,"Hey, Dean. You hungry?"
5,16,MARY,You want the crust cut off?
5,16,DEAN,Yeah. I’d love that.
5,16,SAM,Mom?
5,16,DEAN,"I guess this is not your memory, Sam. Sorry."
5,16,SAM,"Dean, uh. We should… go. Keep looking for the road."
5,16,DEAN,"Just… just give me a minute, okay?"
5,16,SAM,Dean…
5,16,DEAN,Sam. Please. One minute.
5,16,MARY,"(on phone) Hello? … No, John. … We’re not having this conversation again. … Think about what? … You’ve two boys at home. …"
5,16,DEAN,I remember this. Mom and Dad were fighting and then he moved out for a couple days.
5,16,SAM,Dad always said they had the perfect marriage.
5,16,DEAN,It wasn’t perfect until after she died.
5,16,MARY,(on phone) Fine. Then don’t. … There’s nothing more to talk about.
5,16,SAM,What happens next?
5,16,DEAN,"It’s okay, Mom. Dad still loves you. I love you, too. I’ll never leave you."
5,16,MARY,You are my little angel. (She smiles too wide.) How 'bout some pie? Okay.
5,16,DEAN,What?
5,16,SAM,I just never realized how long you’ve been cleaning up Dad’s messes.
5,16,DEAN,(frowning) Whatever. Let’s keep moving.
5,16,SAM,I’ve seen this somewhere before.
5,16,DEAN,Where?
5,16,DEAN,Where are we?
5,16,SAM,No way.
5,16,SAM,"Bones! Hey, c’mere! C’mere!"
5,16,SAM,"Hey, hey, hey, hey…"
5,16,DEAN,Bones?
5,16,SAM,Yeah. Bones was my dog. Hey. (Sam stands up and goes to a cheap coffee table. He opens up a pizza box.
5,16,DEAN,Your… your dog?
5,16,SAM,Yeah.
5,16,DEAN,Is this Flagstaff?
5,16,SAM,"(looks happy) Yeah. (He pets Bones.) Hey, boy."
5,16,DEAN,This is a good memory for you?
5,16,SAM,"(laughing) Yeah. I mean, I was on my own for two weeks. I lived on Funyuns and Mr. Pibb. (He feeds Bones some of his pizza.)"
5,16,DEAN,(unimpressed) Wow.
5,16,SAM,What?
5,16,DEAN,"Well, you don’t remember, do you? You ran away on my watch. I looked everywhere for you. I thought you were dead. And when Dad came home…"
5,16,SAM,"Dean, look, I’m sorry. I never thought about it like that."
5,16,DEAN,Forget it. Let’s roll.
5,16,SAM,"Stay. Bones-y, stay."
5,16,DEAN,What memory is this?
5,16,SAM,"(obviously lying) No idea. (He sniffs.) Alright, come on. Dean… Road. God. Remember?"
5,16,DEAN,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This? (He looks at Sam accusingly.) This is the night you ditched us for Stanford, isn’t it? This is your idea of heaven? Wow. (He laughs painfully) This was one of the worst nights of my life."
5,16,SAM,I can’t control this stuff.
5,16,DEAN,Seriously? I mean this is a happy memory for you?
5,16,SAM,"I don’t know. I mean, I was on my own. I finally got away from Dad."
5,16,DEAN,"(turning away) Yeah, he wasn’t the only one you got away from."
5,16,SAM,"Dean, I’m sorry. I just, uh…"
5,16,DEAN,"I know. You didn’t, you didn’t think of it like that."
5,16,SAM,Dean!
5,16,DEAN,C’mon! Your heaven is somebody else’s Thanksgiving. Okay. It’s bailing on your family. What do you want me to say?
5,16,SAM,"Man, I never got the crusts cut off my PB & J. I just don’t look at family the way you do."
5,16,DEAN,"Yeah, but I’m your family."
5,16,SAM,I know…
5,16,DEAN,"I mean, we’re supposed to be a team. It’s supposed to be you and me against the world, right?"
5,16,SAM,"Dean, it is!"
5,16,DEAN,(after a pause) Is it?
5,16,DEAN,Go! Go!
5,16,ZACHARIAH,Wow. Running from angels. On foot. In heaven. With out-of-the-box thinking like that I’m surprised you boys haven’t stopped the Apocalypse already.
5,16,ZACHARIAH,"Guys. What’s the problem? I just want to send you back to Earth, that’s all."
5,16,ZACHARIAH,"I mean, that is, after I tear you a cosmos of new ones. You’re on my turf now, boys. And by the time I through with you, you’re going to be begging to say yes."
5,16,ZACHARIAH,"Guys, c’mon. You can run but you can’t run."
5,16,ASH,Shh. (He waves them forward.) Hurry! This way.
5,16,SAM,Wait. Who are you?
5,16,ASH,"Buenos dias, bitches."
5,16,DEAN,Ash?
5,16,ASH,Welcome to my blue heaven.
5,16,DEAN,"Good God, the Roadhouse. It even smells the same."
5,16,ASH,"(picking up his cape and mask) Bud, blood and beer nuts. It’s the best smell in the world. (He walks behind the bar and snaps his fingers.) How 'bout a cold one? Up here? No hangover."
5,16,SAM,So… no offense…
5,16,ASH,"(interrupting) How did a dirt bag like me end up in a place like this? I’ve been saved, man. I was my congregation’s number one snake handler."
5,16,SAM,(smiling) And you said this was your heaven?
5,16,ASH,Yup! My own… personal… (Ash shotguns his beer while Sam and Dean watch. He burps.)
5,16,SAM,And when the angels jumped us? We were…
5,16,ASH,In your heaven.
5,16,SAM,So there’re two heavens?
5,16,ASH,"No. More like a hundred billion. So, no worries, it’ll take those angels boys a minute to catch up."
5,16,DEAN,(completely confused) What?
5,16,ASH,"See, you gotta stop thinking of heaven as one place. It’s more like a butt-load of places all crammed together. Like Disneyland except without all the anti-Semitism."
5,16,SAM,Disneyland?
5,16,DEAN,So everybody gets a little slice of paradise.
5,16,ASH,Pretty much. A few people share—special cases. What not.
5,16,DEAN,What do you mean ‘special’?
5,16,ASH,"Aw, you know. Like, uh, soul-mates. (Silence greets his statement. Dean and Sam don’t look at each other.) Anyway. Most people can’t leave their own private Idaho’s."
5,16,DEAN,But you ain’t most people.
5,16,SAM,Who?
5,16,ASH,"He wrote the Kama Sutra. Huh, that boy’s heaven? Ah, sweaty. Confusing."
5,16,DEAN,All this from a guy who used to sleep on a pool table.
5,16,ASH,"Yeah. Now that I’m dead, I’m living, man, a whole lot more."
5,16,SAM,So how’d you find us?
5,16,ASH,"I rigged up my very own (he pulls a laptop from under the bar) holy-rolling police scanner. (He hits the power button and it starts up, displaying a mess of sound graphs and making an annoying piercing sound.) That’s angels. Blabbing Enochian, okay? I’m fluent. (He turns it off and puts in back under the counter.) I heard that you were up. Of course I had to come find you. Again."
5,16,DEAN,(surprised) Again?
5,16,ASH,"This ain’t the first time here. I mean, you boys die more than anyone I’ve ever met."
5,16,DEAN,(even more surprised) Really.
5,16,ASH,"Ah, yeah… you don’t remember. God! Angels. Must’ve Windexed your brain."
5,16,SAM,"So, uh. I mean, have you found anybody else? Ellen and Jo?"
5,16,ASH,(taken aback) Ellen and Jo are dead?
5,16,SAM,"Uh, yeah. Yeah. A few months now. Sorry."
5,16,ASH,"Um, hmm. Uh, they went down fighting?"
5,16,SAM,(nods) Yeah. 'Til the end.
5,16,DEAN,"(bitterly) Yeah, a lot of good it did. How ‘bout our folks?"
5,16,SAM,Pamela!
5,16,PAMELA,Nice to see you boys again.
5,16,ASH,(fake shivering) Ooo.
5,16,SAM,So this is how you get around up here?
5,16,ASH,"Hm, more or less. It’s awesome to finally have an application—a practical application—for string theory."
5,16,DEAN,So!
5,16,PAMELA,So. (She reaches over and swats him lightly on the head.) That’s for getting me killed.
5,16,DEAN,"Yeah. That’s… probably less than I deserve. Makes you feel any better, we got Ash killed too."
5,16,ASH,I’m cool with it. (He snaps his fingers.)
5,16,DEAN,He’s cool with it. So you… you good?
5,16,PAMELA,I’m good. Really. Remember my death scene? Gut shot. Coughing blood. You told me I was going someplace better.
5,16,DEAN,I was lying.
5,16,PAMELA,You were right! My heaven? It is one long show at the Meadowlands. It’s amazing! You should see it.
5,16,DEAN,(nodding his head) Yeah.
5,16,PAMELA,You don’t believe me.
5,16,DEAN,"No, I do, it’s just, you know. Spending eternity trapped in your own little universe while the angels run the show, that’s lonely. You know. That’s not Nirvana. That’s the Matrix."
5,16,PAMELA,I don’t know. Attic’s still better than the basement.
5,16,DEAN,"Yeah, but (he holds his hand out) you know this place feels real, but it’s Memorex. Real is down there."
5,16,PAMELA,"Yeah, well, close enough. Look, Dean, I’m happy. I’m at peace."
5,16,DEAN,"What? Are you trying to sell me a time share? I mean, what’s with the pitch?"
5,16,PAMELA,(chuckling) I know that Michael wants to take you out for a test drive.
5,16,DEAN,(interrupting) Pamela…
5,16,PAMELA,Just saying. What happens if you play ball with them? Worst case.
5,16,DEAN,A lot of people die.
5,16,PAMELA,And then they come here. Is that really so bad? Look. Maybe… you don’t have to fight it so hard. That’s all I’m trying to say.
5,16,SAM,Hey! Found a short cut to the Garden.
5,16,ASH,Oh yeah.
5,16,ASH,All Access Pass to the Magic Kingdom.
5,16,DEAN,(standing behind him) Good.
5,16,DEAN,Not good?
5,16,ASH,That Zachary fella’s going to be watching every road to the Garden.
5,16,PAMELA,Watch your ass. (Sam nods and leaves.) And Dean.
5,16,PAMELA,Yup. Just how I imagined.
5,16,ASH,"Ah, gentlemen. I don’t mean to be a downer or anything but… I’m sure I’ll see you again soon."
5,16,DEAN,"Well, keep a sixer on ice for us."
5,16,ASH,(nods) Yeah.
5,16,DEAN,What the… Why we back home?
5,16,SAM,I don’t know. So what are we going to do?
5,16,DEAN,"Keep looking for the road again, I guess."
5,16,MARY,Honey. Why are you up?
5,16,DEAN,Look. I’m-I’m sorry. I love you but you’re not real and we don’t have time—
5,16,MARY,Did you have another nightmare? Tell me.
5,16,DEAN,I gotta go.
5,16,MARY,"Then how 'bout I tell you my nightmare, Dean? The night I burned."
5,16,DEAN,"(shaky) Sammy, let’s get out of here."
5,16,MARY,Don’t you walk away from me. (Dean stops) I never loved you. You were my burden. I was shackled to you. Look what it got me. (She blinks and her eyes turn yellow.)
5,16,SAM,Dean.
5,16,MARY,"The worst was the smell. The pain, well. What can you say about your skin bubbling off? But the smell was so… You know, for a second I thought I’d left a pot roast burning in the oven. But… it was my meat."
5,16,MARY,"And then, finally, I was dead. The one silver lining was that at least I was away from you. (She takes a big breath.) Everybody leaves you, Dean. You noticed? Mommy. Daddy. Even Sam."
5,16,MARY,"You ever ask yourself why? Maybe it’s not them. Maybe, it’s you. (She chuckles.)"
5,16,ZACHARIAH,"Easy now, kitten."
5,16,SAM,(accusingly) You did this.
5,16,ZACHARIAH,"And I’m just getting started. I mean, guys. Did you really think you could just sneak past me into Mission Control?"
5,16,SAM,You son of a bitch.
5,16,ZACHARIAH,"You know, I’d say the same thing about you, Sam, but I have actually grown quite fond of your mother. Or at least the Blessed Memory of her."
5,16,ZACHARIAH,I think we’re going to be logging a lot of quality time together. I’ve discovered she’s quite the... MILF.
5,16,DEAN,"You can gloat all you want, you dick, you’re still bald."
5,16,ZACHARIAH,"In heaven, I have six wings and four faces, one of whom is a lion. You see this because you’re…"
5,16,ZACHARIAH,(continuing) ...limited.
5,16,ZACHARIAH,"Let’s brass tack this, shall we?"
5,16,DEAN,"You gonna ball-gag us until we say yes? Huh, yeah, I’ve heard that one too."
5,16,ZACHARIAH,I’m going to do a lot more than that. I’ve cleared my schedule. Get him up.
5,16,ZACHARIAH,"Let me tell you something. I was on the fast track once. Employee of the month, every month, forever. I would walk these halls and people would AVERT THEIR EYES! (The house rumbles and shakes.) I HAD ‘‘RESPECT’’! And then they assigned me you. Now look at me. (He chuckles unhappily.) I can’t close the deal on a couple of flannel-wearing maggots? Everybody’s laughing at me… and they’re right to do it. So! Say yes, don’t say yes; I’m still going to take it out of your asses. It’s personal now, boys, and the last person in the history of creation you want as your enemy is me. And I’ll tell you why. Lucifer may be strong, but I’m… ‘‘petty’’. I’m going to be the angel on your shoulder for the rest of eternity."
5,16,JOSHUA,Excuse me. Sir?
5,16,ZACHARIAH,I’m in a meeting.
5,16,JOSHUA,I’m sorry. I need to speak to those two.
5,16,ZACHARIAH,(shocked) Excuse me?
5,16,JOSHUA,"It’s a bad time, I know, but I’m afraid I have to insist."
5,16,ZACHARIAH,You don’t get to insist jack-squat.
5,16,JOSHUA,"No, you’re right. But the boss does. His orders."
5,16,ZACHARIAH,(uncertain) You’re lying.
5,16,JOSHUA,"I wouldn’t lie about this. Look, fire me if you want. Sooner or later, he’s going to come back home and you know how he is with that whole wrath thing."
5,16,SAM,This is heaven’s Garden?
5,16,DEAN,It’s-it’s nice… ish. I guess.
5,16,JOSHUA,"You see what  you want to here. For some it’s God’s throne room; for others it’s Eden. You two, I believe it’s the Cleveland Botanical Gardens. You came here on a field trip."
5,16,SAM,You’re Joshua.
5,16,JOSHUA,(nods) I’m Joshua.
5,16,SAM,"So, you talk to God."
5,16,JOSHUA,"Mostly, He talks to me."
5,16,SAM,"Well, we need to speak to Him. It’s important."
5,16,DEAN,Where is he?
5,16,JOSHUA,On Earth.
5,16,DEAN,Doing what?
5,16,JOSHUA,I don’t know.
5,16,SAM,Do you know where on Earth?
5,16,JOSHUA,"No, sorry. We don’t exactly speak face-to-face."
5,16,DEAN,I… I don’t get it. God’s not talking to nobody so…
5,16,JOSHUA,"Why’s he talking to me. I sometimes think it’s because I can sympathize—gardener to gardener—and, between us, I think he gets lonely."
5,16,DEAN,"(disgusted) Well, my heart’s breaking for him."
5,16,SAM,"(interrupting) Well, can you at least get him a message for us?"
5,16,JOSHUA,"Actually, he has a message for you. Back off."
5,16,DEAN,What?
5,16,JOSHUA,He knows already. Everything you want to tell him.
5,16,DEAN,But…
5,16,JOSHUA,He knows what the angels are doing. He knows that the Apocalypse has begun. He just doesn’t think it’s his problem.
5,16,DEAN,(stunned) Not his problem?
5,16,JOSHUA,"God saved you already. He put you on that plane. He brought back Castiel. He granted you salvation in heaven (he turns to face Sam directly) and after everything you’ve done too. It’s more than he’s intervened in a long time. He’s finished. Magic amulet or not, you won’t be able to find him."
5,16,DEAN,But he can stop it. He can stop all of it.
5,16,JOSHUA,"I suppose he could, but he won’t."
5,16,DEAN,Why not?
5,16,JOSHUA,Why does he allow evil in the first place? You could drive yourself nuts asking questions like that.
5,16,DEAN,So he’s just going to sit back and watch the world burn?
5,16,JOSHUA,"I know how important this was to you, Dean. I’m sorry."
5,16,DEAN,"(emotional) Forget it. Just another dead-beat dad with a bunch of excuses, right. I’m used to that. I’ll muddle through."
5,16,JOSHUA,"Except… you don’t know if you can, this time. You can’t kill the Devil, and you’re losing faith, in yourself, your brother, and now this?"
5,16,JOSHUA,God was your last hope. I just… I wish I could tell you something different.
5,16,SAM,(concerned) How do we know you’re telling the truth?
5,16,JOSHUA,You think that I would lie?
5,16,SAM,It’s just that… you’re not exactly the first angel we’ve met.
5,16,JOSHUA,"I’m rooting for you boys! I wish I could do more to help you, I do! But... I just trim the hedges."
5,16,DEAN,So what now.
5,16,JOSHUA,"You go home again. I’m afraid this time, won’t be like the last. This time, God wants you (he lifts a hand) to remember."
5,16,SAM,You alright?
5,16,DEAN,Define alright.
5,16,CASTIEL,Maybe… maybe Joshua was lying.
5,16,SAM,"I don’t think he was, Cas. I’m sorry. (He sighs.)"
5,16,CASTIEL,You son of a bitch. I believed in…
5,16,CASTIEL,I don’t need this anymore.
5,16,CASTIEL,It’s worthless.
5,16,SAM,Cas. Wait.
5,16,SAM,"We’ll find another way. We can still stop all this, Dean."
5,16,DEAN,(finally looking up) How?
5,16,SAM,"I don’t know, but we’ll find it. You and me, we’ll find it."
5,20,TEASER,INT. LAB
6,1,Sid,Really? Pest control.
6,1,Sam,"Dean, they're already dead, and you know it."
6,3,SAM,Wow.
6,3,DEAN,"[ Reading a report. ] ""Suspect exited vehicle brandishing a firearm. We were forced to fire."""
6,3,SAM,"[ Imitating Castiel ] ""Hello."""
6,4,CROWLEY,Name's Crowley.
6,4,BOBBY,You're Crowley?
6,4,CROWLEY,"I can give you anything you want, mate. All I need is –"
6,4,BOBBY,My soul.
6,4,DEAN,You sold your soul?
6,4,CROWLEY,"No, more like pawned it.  I fully intend to give it back."
6,4,DEAN,"Well then, give it back!"
6,4,CROWLEY,I can't.
6,4,DEAN,Can't or won't?
6,4,CROWLEY,"I won't, alright. It's insurance."
6,4,BOBBY,Rufus Turner. He's a hunter.
6,4,DEAN,One of your old friends?
6,4,BOBBY,Friends?  He’s not the Christmas card type.
6,4,BOBBY,Agent Willis speaking.
6,4,SAM,So you know Bobby Singer?
6,4,SAM,I thought the sheriff hated you?
6,4,BOBBY,She did till five days ago.
6,4,DEAN,What happened five days ago?
6,4,BOBBY,The dead started rising all over town.
6,4,CROWLEY,"Bobby, are you just going to sit there?"
6,4,BOBBY,"No, I'm gonna Riverdance."
6,4,CROWLEY,You really wasted that crossroads deal.
6,4,BOBBY,Son of a bitch.
6,4,CROWLEY,Hello – King of the Crossroads.
6,4,DEAN,Are you okay?
6,4,SAM,"Yeah, I'm great."
6,4,DEAN,There's been a few times that you've got me wondering.  Something’s different with you.
6,4,SAM,I'm okay.
6,4,DEAN,"You went to hell, Sam."
6,4,TV,Yesterday this Galveston shoreline was being pounded by ten foot swells and winds up to 150 miles per hour…
6,4,TV,"…but today, well, there's not a cloud in sight.  Hurricane Tiffany has broken up over the Gulf –"
6,4,CROWLEY,"Been making merry, have we?"
6,4,BOBBY,Bite me.
6,4,CROWLEY,"If that's your thing.  (snaps fingers to turn off TV and steps toward Bobby)  That Swan dive of Sam's was a thing of beauty.   Tens all the way round.  Standing ov from the Romanian judge.  You should be proud, Bobby. As deaths go, it wasn’t too shabby.  Cheer up, mate, we just saved the sodding world together.  Me, I've been celebrating."
6,4,BOBBY,I'd hate to see what you call celebrating.
6,4,CROWLEY,"Yes, you would."
6,4,BOBBY,Drink?
6,4,CROWLEY,(looks appalled) No!
6,4,BOBBY,"Let me get this straight – we just (mocking Crowley's accent) “saved the sodding world together,” and you're too good to drink with me?"
6,4,CROWLEY,Obviously. (Crowley points to a bottle on the television) I doubt that you have my brand.
6,4,BOBBY,"What's your poison, your highness?"
6,4,CROWLEY,(breaths in deep) Craig.  Aged 30 years at least. I've been drinking it since grade school.
6,4,BOBBY,"Well, I got old rotgut aged 6 days (Bobby takes a drink as Crowley watches)"
6,4,CROWLEY,"Swill like that is gonna burn a hole in your soul – oops sorry, my soul. But that’s why you called.  Our little deal."
6,4,BOBBY,"Yeah, well, it's about time you hold up your end and give it back."
6,4,CROWLEY,Give it back?
6,4,BOBBY,"Our deal was, we ice Lucifer, you rip up the lease."
6,4,CROWLEY,(smirks) Oh. (turns away from Bobby) You didn't read your contract.
6,4,BOBBY,"The hell you talking about, contract?"
6,4,CROWLEY,"Paragraph 18, subsection B, which is on you naughty bits – I only have to make “best efforts” to give you back your soul."
6,4,BOBBY,Meaning what?
6,4,CROWLEY,Meaning… (makes a straining gesture and sighs) I’d like to – but I can't.
6,4,BOBBY,You lying sack of – (Crowley cuts him off)
6,4,CROWLEY,"Ten years (Crowley walks across the room towards Bobby), you come to daddy.  Until then, I suggest you start drinking the good stuff."
6,4,BOBBY,I figured you'd say that.  So you can rot here till you change your mind.
6,4,CROWLEY,Why?  ’Cause you asked nicely?
6,4,BOBBY,No. (Bobby walks past Crowley to the back of the room) ’Cause I'm going Dateline on your ass. (Bobby turns off the light and we see a Devil's Trap painted on the floor in glowing paint.
6,4,CROWLEY,I hope that's paint. Really. (sighs) What am I going to do?
6,4,CROWLEY,"Doggie breath.  (Bobby is covering his face)  Bracing, isn't it?"
6,4,CROWLEY,"Ball’s in your court, Robert. Ten years of living or ten years as Alpo."
6,4,BOBBY,(holding his knife in a threatening manner) This ain't over.
6,4,CROWLEY,I wouldn't have it any other way.  (Crowley walk out of the trap and pauses in front of Bobby) Happy hunting. Crowley walks off leaving Bobby fuming.
6,4,SAM,No EMF. Find anything in there?
6,4,DEAN,"Yeah, I've got some kind of a claw. (Dean picks up the claw from the ground)"
6,4,SAM,What in the hell has a claw like that? (Dean pulls out his phone)
6,4,DEAN,That is a good question. (Dean makes a call)
6,4,SAM,Maybe he's in the can.
6,4,BOBBY,Yeah?
6,4,DEAN,"What happened, you fall and can't get up?"
6,4,BOBBY,What's up?
6,4,DEAN,"Six bodies, chests cracked wide open.  No EMF, no sulfur, no hex bags."
6,4,DEAN,"Alright, check your Wang."
6,4,BOBBY,That's a new one.
6,4,DEAN,Yeah. We need an ID ASAP.
6,4,BOBBY,"Dean, I'm a little busy."
6,4,DEAN,"Well then, kick Bo Derek out of your bathtub."
6,4,BOBBY,I'll call you back. (He hangs up the phone)
6,4,BOBBY,Balls! (He slams a book shut)
6,4,BOBBY,Balls!
6,4,BOBBY,Come on.  Come on. (Bobby tries the engine one more time and sighs) Balls.
6,4,BOBBY,You're hunting a Lamia.
6,4,DEAN,Come again?  (Takes a bite of his sandwich)
6,4,BOBBY,"Juices hearts, chugs the blood. (sighs) Never heard of one popping up…"
6,4,DEAN,"Yeah, well, looks like this freak is immigrating. It’s snacking on cheese heads."
6,4,BOBBY,There’s a couple of ways.  Easiest is a silver knife blessed…
6,4,DEAN,(still chewing) Gotcha. (He hangs up the phone)
6,4,BOBBY,You're welcome.
6,4,FEMALE VOICE,"Hey, I'm still here!"
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,"Hey there, cranky.  You were gone so long, I just assumed alcoholic coma."
6,4,BOBBY,Where were we?
6,4,BOBBY,Right. Talk.
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,"Look at you, all in a rush.  Foreplay… (uncrosses her legs and recrosses them) …gets you more play."
6,4,BOBBY,"I want Crowley's name. (The crossroads demon looks at him and smiles)  His real name, back when he was flesh and blood."
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,(changes eyes from red to normal) Does tying up demons in your basement make you feel better about that time that you killed your wife?
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,What's that?
6,4,BOBBY,You don't recognize them?  They're yours.
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,It won't work.  It's a myth.
6,4,BOBBY,Then you got nothing to worry about.
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,(gasping in pain) I can't.
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,(her flesh burned) You don't know what he’ll do to me.
6,4,BOBBY,Right now you better worry about me.
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,You don't get it. He's the King.
6,4,BOBBY,King of the Crossroads. I've heard the speech.
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,(groaning in pain) No. King of Hell.
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,You gonna get that or what?
6,4,CUT TO,
6,4,BOBBY,(looks around) Marcy.
6,4,MARCY,Bobby Singer. How long have we been neighbors?
6,4,BOBBY,(guessing) Six months?
6,4,MARCY,"Well, don't you think it's time you welcomed me to the neighborhood? (Marcy offers the tray to Bobby and uncovers it) My famous ginger peach cobbler."
6,4,MARCY,"Take a whiff. Seriously, I'm a genius."
6,4,BOBBY,It's stupid horror flicks. Guilty pleasure.
6,4,MARCY,I love scary movies.  Hey have you seen “Drag Me To Hell”?
6,4,BOBBY,(awkward pause) Trying to avoid it.
6,4,MARCY,"But it's fantastic. (Marcy takes a deep breath) Saturday, seven o'clock, my house. I'll fix you dinner and I'll whip up a batch of my famous white chocolate popcorn and we'll watch it.  Deal?"
6,4,BOBBY,"That sounds super, Marcy, but uh –"
6,4,MARCY,"Okay, no worries.  Um, hey, one other thing.  Uh, my wood chipper – it’s a piece of crap, you know. It just broke down on me and – and I hear that you’re quite handy.  Maybe you could come over and take a look. You know, just whenever –"
6,4,BOBBY,Yeah.  I'll see what I can do.
6,4,MARCY,"(smiling, pleased)  Okay."
6,4,MARCY,"Well, okay… (Marcy holds Bobby's hand for a little longer) …okay, I'll see you soon."
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,"Aww. She sounds nice. (Bobby walks past the demon, ignoring her)  Are you going to make sweet love to her before you stab her to death, Bobby?  (Bobby relights the pilot of the flame thrower) That is your usual thing, right?"
6,4,BOBBY,I want Crowley's name now! (The demon continues to scream and we see her flesh blister and burn)  Crowley's name!
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,"(whimpering) Okay, okay. (Bobby take the flame off the tub)  MacLeod.  Fergus MacLeod.  I swear.  We call him Lucky the Leprechaun behind his back."
6,4,BOBBY,"MacLeod's Scottish, Einstein."
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,"You got what you want, now send me back. (Bobby grabs a can of lighter fluid and soaks what's in the tub)  No! (Bobby keeps pouring lighter fluid)  We had a deal."
6,4,BOBBY,I gave it my best effort.
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,No!
6,4,BOBBY,"Yeah, Garth, what do you got? (Bobby listens to Garth) Never heard of a vamp doin’ that.  It doesn't sound like our kind of thing.  Better drop a dime to the FBI."
6,4,BOBBY,"Willis, FBI. (Bobby listens to the caller) No, Garth, not me, the FBI.  The real FBI!  How are you still alive?"
6,4,BOBBY,"Yeah, Castle."
6,4,BOBBY,Yeah.
6,4,BOBBY,Yeah.
6,4,BOBBY,Willis.
6,4,BOBBY,"Uh huh. Of course she's one of ours.  And if she says she's got to dig that grave up, you better damn well let her."
6,4,RUFUS,"(out of breath) Oh, good, you’re home!  Listen. You gotta help me bury a body."
6,4,BOBBY,Why'd you bring it here?
6,4,RUFUS,"The law is on my tail!  What was your guess?  (Bobby looks at Rufus) What, what, what?  They got lucky."
6,4,BOBBY,"Yeah, or you’re getting slow."
6,4,RUFUS,"Yeah, I'm getting slow – says mister sits on his ass all day taking calls."
6,4,BOBBY,"(looking at the body) Vamp, shifter – what?"
6,4,RUFUS,None of the above.  (Rufus pulls the lips on the body back to expose the teeth and looks over at Bobby)
6,4,BOBBY,Okami?  Where’d you shiv it?
6,4,RUFUS,Get this.  Billings.  (Rufus closes the mouth)
6,4,BOBBY,The only time I ever saw one of these was in Japan.
6,4,RUFUS,Duh. No one's ever seen one of these except in Japan.
6,4,BOBBY,"For what it's worth, Sam and Dean are tracking a Lamia in Wisconsin."
6,4,RUFUS,Get out.  I thought they never leave Greece.
6,4,BOBBY,"Monsters lately.  Is it me, or is it weird?"
6,4,RUFUS,"Yeah well, it’s definitely something. (Rufus stops pondering and snaps his head up)  So, you got a shovel?"
6,4,RUFUS,"Man, I know what I want for Hanukkah."
6,4,CUT TO,"Bobby and Rufus approach a deep, rectangular hole in the ground. Rufus drops the body into the hole."
6,4,CUT TO,Bobby and Rufus are finishing filling in the hole.
6,4,RUFUS,So the son of a bitch's  name is Fergus McCloud?
6,4,BOBBY,That's the son of a bitch's name.
6,4,RUFUS,(raking the dirt over the ground) Where are you gonna look?
6,4,BOBBY,"(rests on shovel to look at Rufus) Scotland.  Crowley let slip that he likes Craig. It's, uh –"
6,4,RUFUS,"(Rufus stops raking) It's Scotch.  Only made and sold in a tiny area on the north tip of Caithness county.  It's peaty and sharp, with a long finish of citrus and tobacco notes. (Rufus goes back to raking as Bobby stares at him.  Rufus notices and stops)  Hey, what?  What am I, a heathen? (Rufus throws out his arms)  I know what Craig is."
6,4,BOBBY,"Well, I got a hunch that that's where Crowley lived and died back when he was a human, a few hundred years before he got the big squeeze in hell and came out a demon."
6,4,RUFUS,(stops to look at Bobby)  You know I've got contacts over there. (pauses) I could make a few calls. (starts to rake again)
6,4,BOBBY,"(rests on shovel again) Well, I ain't askin' for no help."
6,4,RUFUS,(rests on his rake) I ain't askin' for your permission.
6,4,BOBBY,Yeah.
6,4,DEAN,What's another way to kill a Lamia?
6,4,BOBBY,"Well, what happened to the silver knife…"
6,4,DEAN,That didn't pan out.  What's plan B?
6,4,SAM,(in pain) Dean. (Sam is pulled away from the pillar)
6,4,DEAN,"Come on Bobby, get the lead out!"
6,4,BOBBY,Where are you?
6,4,DEAN,In a church. In a rectory.
6,4,BOBBY,Is there a kitchen?
6,4,BOBBY,Find salt...
6,4,AGENT ADAMS,Mr. Singer.  I'm Agent Adams. (Adams puts away his badge) I believe you know Sheriff Mills.
6,4,BOBBY,My mom.  Just a sec.
6,4,DEAN,Rosemary! (The creature growls)
6,4,BOBBY,"Great, great.  Now blend the herbs…"
6,4,BOBBY,Cook well.
6,4,DEAN,Sammy!
6,4,DEAN,(voice heard as the lighter clicks) Fire in the hole!
6,4,BOBBY,"Okay.  Great. Great. Enjoy the roast, Mom."
6,4,AGENT ADAMS,"(has a sketch in his hand) Have you seen this man?  Rufus Turner, aka Luther Vandros, aka Ruben Studdard."
6,4,BOBBY,"No, I've never seen that dick."
6,4,AGENT ADAMS,How do you know he's a dick?
6,4,BOBBY,Lucky guess.
6,4,AGENT ADAMS,Funny.  ’Cause I got a couple of guys working the highway said they saw him pull in here.  Carrying a body.
6,4,BOBBY,"Well, that's ridiculous.  Look, it's a workday, I gotta…"
6,4,AGENT ADAMS,I just want to take a look around.
6,4,BOBBY,"You got a warrant, sonny?"
6,4,AGENT ADAMS,"(walking forward to be in Bobby's face) Well, do I need one, sir?"
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,"(patting both men on the chest)  Okay fellas, put the rulers away.  Zip up. (talks to Agent Adams)  Look, Bobby here is a kind of a (looks at Bobby for the right word) crank.  And he ain't what you call a fan of big brother, but me and him – (to Bobby)  How long I been arresting you now?  Ten years?"
6,4,BOBBY,Thereabouts.
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,"Yeah, we got a history, so... what do you say just let me scope the place out?  That okay?  You could just wait outside."
6,4,AGEBT ADAMS,(looks at Sheriff Mills then turns for the door) Five minutes.
6,4,BOBBY,Why did you send him outside?
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,’Cause I didn't think you’d want him in here.
6,4,BOBBY,I don't. I've got a body in the basement.
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,My point.
6,4,BOBBY,"Yeah, but I've got another body buried in the yard. (Sheriff Mills' eyes get wide)"
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,"Damn it.  (She goes to the front door to look outside, then looks at Bobby.)  He's not there."
6,4,BOBBY,(irritated sigh) Balls!
6,4,AGENT ADAMS,"Mr. Singer, come with me, please."
6,4,AGENT ADAMS,Do you mind explaining this?
6,4,BOBBY,"What, you never had a septic tank explode on you?  I got it pretty well cleaned up, but watch where you step."
6,4,RUFUS,"Get back – I’m two states over, Bobby. I can't."
6,4,BOBBY,The Okami ain't dead.
6,4,RUFUS,Of course it is.
6,4,BOBBY,Did you use a bamboo dagger?
6,4,BOBBY,Blessed by a Shinto priest?
6,4,RUFUS,"I'm not an imbecile, Bobby."
6,4,BOBBY,Did you stab it seven times?
6,4,RUFUS,(pauses) Five times.
6,4,BOBBY (exasperated),It's seven!
6,4,RUFUS,"No, I'm pretty sure it's five."
6,4,BOBBY,"Well, clearly it's seven times."
6,4,BOBBY,What was it feeding on when you found it?
6,4,RUFUS,Single white females –
6,4,BOBBY,(out of breath) Where's your bedroom?
6,4,MARCY,"Bobby, I'm trying to keep my cool but, what are you doing in my house with a shotgun?"
6,4,BOBBY,(stops searching to look at Marcy) Have you seen anything (pauses for the right word) weird?
6,4,MARCY,(raises eyebrows) You mean besides you?
6,4,MARCY,"(screaming) Bobby, no!  Look out!"
6,4,BOBBY,"I, uh – I thought your chipper was broke."
6,4,MARCY,(covered in blood and in shock) I just said that to get you over here.
6,4,BOBBY,"(pauses) Oh. Well, I guess I could come over for dinner some night.  Might be fun."
6,4,MARCY,I don't think so.
6,4,BOBBY,(has an “it figures” look and nods) Story of my life.
6,4,BOBBY,Don't act so surprised.
6,4,RUFUS,How about Godzilla?
6,4,BOBBY,Put her down.
6,4,BOBBY,Wood chipper.
6,4,RUFUS,"Oh, okey dokey. Wood chipper, that – that pretty much trumps everything."
6,4,RUFUS,"Look, listen, Bobby, thank you.  I screwed up."
6,4,BOBBY,Forget it.  I figure –
6,4,RUFUS,"Alrighty, then add one more thing to the list.  I got a lead on your boy Crowley."
6,4,RUFUS,"Fergus Roderick MacLeod. Born in Canisbay, Scotland, 1661."
6,4,BOBBY,Great. I don't know what that's gonna get me.
6,4,RUFUS,"Well, then, behind door number 2, Bob, Crowley had a son."
6,4,BOBBY,(very interested) Did he now?
6,4,RUFUS,Moved across the pond when his parents bit it.  Captained a trading ship –
6,4,RUFUS,…that went down in Massachusetts in 1723.
6,4,RUFUS,Couple of Cousteau wannabes found the wreck about 30 years ago.
6,4,BOBBY,They fish out his bones?
6,4,RUFUS,They did find his signet ring though.
6,4,RUFUS,…the Deep” exhibit at the Maritime Museum at Andover.
6,4,BOBBY,I need that ring.
6,4,RUFUS,"Oooh.  Oooh Are you, um – you askin' for my help, Bob?"
6,4,BOBBY,(irritated) I'm asking for a ring.  And –
6,4,BOBBY,(making a face) …help getting it.
6,4,RUFUS,"(chuckles) I'm way ahead of you, brother."
6,4,RUFUS,"You’re, um... you’re thinking hostage exchange, aren't you?"
6,4,RUFUS,"Get the ghost, you can swap Crowley his son for your soul."
6,4,BOBBY,Something like that.
6,4,RUFUS,Let's hope that works out.
6,4,BOBBY,Dean.  You alright?
6,4,DEAN,"Yeah.  Yeah, the Lamia grilled up fine."
6,4,BOBBY,I sense a “but” coming on.
6,4,DEAN,"It's Sam, Bobby."
6,4,DEAN,"He's just – he's different.  You know, I get it.  You go through something like that and – and you change, but (sees Sam outside the hotel window talking on the phone) something's not right to me."
6,4,BOBBY,Dean.
6,4,DEAN,…about that year.
6,4,BOBBY,Dean. I got another call.
6,4,DEAN,You what?
6,4,BOBBY,I got take this.  It's –
6,4,BOBBY,…important.
6,4,DEAN,(laughs) More important than Sam? (Dean hears a click on the line) Bobby?
6,4,BOBBY,Rufus?
6,4,RUFUS,"The good news is I snagged the ring, Bobby."
6,4,BOBBY,Tell me that ain't –
6,4,RUFUS,Three guesses and one of them – it ain't the paramedics.
6,4,RUFUS,"Listen, Bobby. Bobby, I gotta stash –"
6,4,BOBBY,"Well, don't swallow it."
6,4,RUFUS,"(pauses) Right!  I'm swallowing it, Bobby! (Rufus swallows the ring)"
6,4,BOBBY,"Don't swallow it! (Bobby can hear Rufus swallowing, then drinking something)"
6,4,BOBBY,Damn it.
6,4,BOBBY,"Still there, Dean?"
6,4,DEAN,"Bobby, what the hell?"
6,4,BOBBY,"I, uh – sorry."
6,4,DEAN,"You know you are the one person that I can talk to about this stuff, about Sam –"
6,4,DEAN,Bobby?
6,4,BOBBY,"I – I hear you, son. I – it just ain’t a good time."
6,4,DEAN,"Forget it.  I mean I'm baring my soul like a freaking girl here and, uh –"
6,4,DEAN,"That's fine but, seriously, a little selfish."
6,4,BOBBY,Where's your brother?
6,4,DEAN,Outside.
6,4,BOBBY,Get him.
6,4,BOBBY,Sam.  Dean.
6,4,BOBBY,Sometimes…
6,4,BOBBY,I'm selfish? Me? I do everything for you!  Everything! You need some lores scrounged up –
6,4,BOBBY,You need someone to bitch to about each other –
6,4,BOBBY,Every damn time!
6,4,BOBBY,Jack with a side of squat!
6,4,DEAN,Bobby –
6,4,BOBBY,Do I sound like I'm done?
6,4,BOBBY,God knows I know.  But I got a news flash for you.  You ain't the center of the universe!
6,4,BOBBY,…that Crowley owns my soul!  And the meter is running!
6,4,BOBBY,And – and be damned!  So how about you two sack up and help me for once?
6,4,SAM,"Bobby, all – all you got to do is ask."
6,4,DEAN,Anything you need... we're there.
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,I got a call from Marcy Wards. Seems she had a little “home invasion?”  Told her I’d look into it. (The Sheriff smiles) Didn't bother filing a report.
6,4,BOBBY,Thanks. (takes a deep breath) I need a favor.
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,Luther Vandros show up?  Tell him I'm a fan.
6,4,BOBBY,"His real name is Rufus Turner.  He's being held in Andover, Mass., on a burglary charge. I need you to get him extradited here."
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,Extradited?  Extradited for what?
6,4,BOBBY,Murder.
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,"(laughs, then sees that Bobby is not joking) You’re not joking? (Bobby shakes his head)  Do you have any idea what it takes to extradite a prisoner?  I'd need a court order, permission from the DA... I –I would have to call in every marker I've got and hand out a few to boot."
6,4,BOBBY,So you're saying there's a chance.
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,"And if by some miracle we can get him here, then what?  Then your pal's here on a murder charge.  How are you gonna get him out from under that one?"
6,4,BOBBY,Let me handle the B side.
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,"(laughs) I like you, Bobby. (Bobby lowers his head a bit) But this could nuke my career."
6,4,BOBBY,"(sighs) Look, I've done a lot for this town.  Some you know about. (Tilts head) Some you don't. And I'm not real good at this whole asking for help thing but –"
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,"I'm sorry, Bobby.  I can't."
6,4,RUFUS,Miss me?
6,4,BOBBY,How did you –
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,"(shakes her head) Don't ask.  You got one hour, then I call the feds and tell them he busted out."
6,4,BOBBY,Thanks.
6,4,SHERIFF MILLS,"I lose my job over this, I am taking it out of your ass!"
6,4,BOBBY,Please tell me the ring is still in your stomach.
6,4,BOBBY,I'll go boil some water.
6,4,RUFUS,What?
6,4,BOBBY,Gavin MacLeod?
6,4,GAVIN,Yes. (pause) Is – is this hell?
6,4,BOBBY,That's gonna depend on you.  (Gavin stares at Bobby) You Fergus MacLeod's boy? (Gavin nods)  You and me... we're gonna have a nice long chat.
6,4,CUT TO,Bobby is performing another summoning ritual.  This time Crowley shows up and he looks very annoyed.
6,4,BOBBY,"Well, you look like hammered crap."
6,4,CROWLEY,And you're a vision as always.
6,4,CROWLEY,"Don't we both know how this game ends?  Really Bobby, you gotta know when to fold 'em."
6,4,BOBBY,"Word on the street is that ever since Lucifer went to the pokey, you’re the big kahuna downstairs."
6,4,CROWLEY,I see you've been reading the trades.
6,4,BOBBY,Trouble in Paradise?
6,4,CROWLEY,"Mate.  You... have no idea. (Crowley gets a glass and pours a drink he has brought himself)  I thought… when I got the corner office… (Crowley drops some antacid in the drink) I thought it was all going to be rainbows and two-headed puppies. (turns to look at Bobby)  But, if I'm being honest, it's been hell. (takes a drink)"
6,4,BOBBY,I thought that was the point.
6,4,CROWLEY,(finishes his drink and puts the glass on the table) You know what the problem with demons is?
6,4,BOBBY,They're demons.
6,4,CROWLEY,"Exactly.  Evil lying prats.  The whole lot of them.  And stupid.  Try to show them a – a new way, a better way.  And what do you get?  Bugger all.  You know, there's days that I think Lucifer's whole “Spike anything with black eyes” plan wasn't half bad.  Hmm.  Feels good to get it off my chest.  We should make this a thing."
6,4,BOBBY,(sarcastically) Do I look like Dr. Phil to you?
6,4,CROWLEY,A little. (Bobby gives him a dirty look)  Anyhoo.  Obviously not here for a social call.  So on with it.
6,4,BOBBY,I want –
6,4,CROWLEY,"Save you the recap.  In fact I'll do the shorthand for you. (points at Bobby and speaks in a mock Bobby voice) I want my soul back, idjit. (points at self) 'Fraid not. (points at Bobby and speaks in mock voice) But I'm surly and I got a beard. Gimme! Blah, blah, blah. Homespun cornpone insult, witty retort from yours truly. The bottom line is, you get bubkes.  Are we done?"
6,4,BOBBY,Just getting started.
6,4,CROWLEY,"Gavin?  (Gavin stares at Crowley)  Is that you?  It – it's been so long. (Gavin continues to stare)  I love you so – (Crowley can no longer pretend and laughs) Sorry.  Your soul for my boy, is that it, right?  I've got to give you credit for thinking outside the box on that one, but – problem is... I loathe the little bastard.  You want to torture him, just let me pull up a chair and watch.  Hell, burn his bones and send him down to me and we can have a family reunion.  That right, son?  You picked the wrong bargaining chip this time, my friend."
6,4,BOBBY,"He ain't a chip.  (Crowley looks confused) I was just using him to dig up dirt on you.  And since Gavin hates you maybe even more than you hate him, he was more than happy to squawk."
6,4,CROWLEY,"What did you tell him, son?"
6,4,GAVIN,(smiles wickedly) Everything.
6,4,BOBBY,"(walking toward Crowley) I know it all now.  Fergus.  You may be king of the dirt bags here but, in life, you were nothing but a two-bit tailor who sold his soul in exchange for an extra three inches below the belt."
6,4,CROWLEY,"Just trying to hit double digits. (Bobby smiles at Crowley)  So, you got a glimpse behind the curtain. And?"
6,4,BOBBY,And – now I know where you’re planted.
6,4,CROWLEY,Dean. It's been a long time.  We should get together.
6,4,DEAN,We'll have to do that when I get back.
6,4,CROWLEY,Back?
6,4,DEAN,"Me and Sam – we've gone international.  In fact, we're in your neck of the woods.  (As Dean speaks we see the scenery and the boys by an open grave.)"
6,4,DEAN,Did you really use to wear a skirt?
6,4,CROWLEY,A kilt.  I had very athletic calves.  What's the game?
6,4,DEAN,In fact we just dug yours up.
6,4,CROWLEY,(to Bobby) This is ridiculous.  The whole burning bones thing – it's a myth.
6,4,BOBBY,I know an employee of yours who would disagree.
6,4,CROSSROADS DEMON,What's that?
6,4,BOBBY,You don't recognize them?  They're yours. (inside a bag are human bones)
6,4,CROWLEY,That's where she got to.
6,4,BOBBY,"You demons.  You think you're something special.  But you're just spirits.  Twisted, perverted, evil spirits.  But, end of the day, you're nothing but ghosts with an ego.  (Crowley has his jaw set)  We torch your bones, you go up in flames."
6,4,DEAN,That's me flicking my Bic for you.
6,4,BOBBY,Your bones for my soul.  Going once… (sound of Dean playing with the lighter)
6,4,BOBBY,(hears Dean playing with the lighter) Going twice.
6,4,CROWLEY,(exasperated) Bollocks.
6,4,BOBBY,You can go ahead and leave in the part about my legs.
6,4,BOBBY,Pleasure doing business with you.
6,4,CROWLEY,Now if you don't mind. (Crowley's gaze goes up to the devil's trap over his head)
6,4,CROWLEY,I believe (Sam and Dean turn at Crowley's voice) those are mine.
6,4,DEAN,"You know, now that I think about it, maybe I'll just (clicks lighter) napalm your ass anyhow."
6,4,SAM,"Dean, he's a dick, but a deal’s a deal."
6,4,CROWLEY,"(to Sam) I don't need you fight my battles for me, Moose.  Get bent."
6,4,CROWLEY,"Now, if you'll excuse me.  I've a little hell to raise."
6,4,DEAN,"Hey, any time we get to punk Crowley works for us."
6,4,SAM,Yeah.
6,4,BOBBY,"Still, knowing how much you love flying the friendly skies –"
6,4,BOBBY,I guess a nine hour plane trip was no picnic.
6,4,BOBBY,"What did you do, drink your way through it?"
6,4,DEAN,I was fine.
6,4,SAM,"No, he white knuckled his way through four puke bags."
6,4,DEAN,"But at least I was sober.  If some nutjob decided to try something, I was ready.  I had a fork."
6,4,BOBBY,(laughs) Listen.  Um – about the things I said earlier.  I was in a tough spot and I – I guess I was –
6,4,SAM,We take you for granted.
6,4,DEAN,"You've been cleaning up our messes for years, Bobby.  Without you, I don't even want to think about where me and Sam would’ve ended up."
6,4,BOBBY,"Okay then, let’s roll credits on this chick flick."
6,4,BOBBY,"Try some of the local grub, I hear it's... exotic."
6,4,DEAN,"Oh yeah, no, definitely. We are.  I hear they have an olive garden."
6,4,BOBBY,"Willis. (listens to the other person)  Yeah, he is.  One of our best agents, in fact."
6,7,Sam,You're sure it's vampires?
6,7,Samuel,Definitely.
6,7,Dean,Their alpha's building an army. We don't scare them anymore.
6,7,Samuel,I'm your grandfather.
6,7,Dean,Samuel? We all thought you were dead.
6,7,Samuel,We're guessing whatever pulled Sam up pulled me down.
6,7,Sam,"So, whatever this is, we're both a part of it."
6,7,Dean,But you don't know what that is.
6,7,Bobby,"Dean, you all right?"
6,7,Dean,"It's Sam, Bobby. He's just -- he's different. Something's not right to me."
6,7,Dean,What is wrong with him?
6,7,Castiel,"I don't know, Dean. I'm sorry."
6,7,Samuel,Almost like you let him get turned. Get a man on the inside. Help us find that alpha vamp we've been looking for?
6,7,Sam,"You think I'd do something like that, risk my own brother?"
6,7,Dean,"You got my back. No matter what happens, I can always count on you, right Sammy?"
6,7,Sam,"Of course, Dean."
6,7,Veritas,What are you? You're not human.
6,7,Sam,"Please, just let me explain."
6,7,Dean,Why the hell should I believe anything you say?
6,7,Sam,I need help.
6,7,Castiel,You're right. He looks terrible.
6,7,Castiel,You did this?
6,7,Sam,Cas? What's -- [Grunts] Let me go.
6,7,Castiel,Has he been feverish?
6,7,Dean,Have you?
6,7,Sam,No. Why?
6,7,Castiel,Is he speaking in tongues? Are you speaking in tongues?
6,7,Sam,No. What are you... Are you diagnosing me?
6,7,Dean,You better hope he can.
6,7,Sam,You really think that this is --
6,7,Dean,"What, you think that there's a clinic out there for people who just pop out of hell wrong? He asks, you answer! Then you shut your hole. You got it?"
6,7,Castiel,How much do you sleep?
6,7,Sam,I don't.
6,7,Dean,At all?
6,7,Sam,Not since I got back.
6,7,Dean,And it never occurred to you that there might be something off about that?!
6,7,Sam,"Of course it did, Dean. I-I just never told you."
6,7,Dean,What?
6,7,Castiel,Sam... What are you feeling now?
6,7,Sam,[scoffs] I feel like my nose is broken.
6,7,Castiel,"No, that's a physical sensation. How do you feel?"
6,7,Sam,"Well, I think --"
6,7,Castiel,Feel.
6,7,Sam,I... don't know.
6,7,Sam,What? Uh...
6,7,Castiel,This will be unpleasant.
6,7,Sam,What --
6,7,Castiel,"Bite down on this. If there's someplace that you find soothing, you should go there. In your mind."
6,7,Dean,Did you find anything?
6,7,Castiel,No.
6,7,Dean,So that's good news?
6,7,Castiel,"I'm afraid not. Physically, he's perfectly healthy."
6,7,Dean,Then what?
6,7,Castiel,It's his soul. It's gone.
6,7,Dean,"[scoffs] Um... I'm s-- I'm sorry. One more time, like I'm 5. What do you mean, he's got no --"
6,7,Castiel,"Somehow, when Sam was resurrected, it was without his soul."
6,7,Dean,"So, where is it?"
6,7,Castiel,My guess is... Still in the cage with Michael and Lucifer.
6,7,Dean,"So, is he even still Sam?"
6,7,Castiel,"Well, you pose an interesting philosophical question."
6,7,Dean,"Well, then, just get it back."
6,7,Castiel,Dean.
6,7,Dean,"Well, you pulled me out."
6,7,Castiel,"It took several angels to rescue you, and you weren't nearly as well guarded. Sam's soul is in Lucifer's cage. There's a difference, a big difference. It's not possible."
6,7,Dean,"Okay, well, there's got to be a way."
6,7,Sam,"So, are you gonna untie me?"
6,7,Dean,No.
6,7,Sam,"Listen, I'm not gonna --"
6,7,Dean,"Sam, how the hell am I even supposed to let you out of this room?"
6,7,Sam,"Dean, I'm not some psycho. I didn't want you to get hurt. I was just trying to stop the vamps."
6,7,Sam,I'm sorry. It won't ever happen again. Please let me go.
6,7,Dean,"You're kidding, right?"
6,7,Sam,"Well, what are you gonna do, just keep me locked up in here forever?"
6,7,Dean,You say that like it's a bad thing.
6,7,Sam,"Okay, fine, look, I get it. I get it, Dean. I was wrong. But I'm telling you I-I'm trying to get right. It's still me."
6,7,Dean,Is it?
6,7,Sam,Yes. So just let me go.
6,7,Dean,No way in hell.
6,7,Sam,"I didn't want it to come to this. You're not gonna hold me, Dean -- Not here, not in a panic room, not anywhere. You're stuck with the soulless guy, so you might as well work with me."
6,7,Sam,Let's fix this.
6,7,Dean,I'm gonna be watching every move you make.
6,7,Sam,Fine. Sounds about right to me.
6,7,Dean,"Cas, clean him up."
6,7,Dean,"All right, if we're gonna figure out what happened to your soul, then we need to find who yanked you out."
6,7,Dean,You say you don't know?
6,7,Sam,No idea.
6,7,Dean,"Then we start a list. If it's so hard to spring someone out of the box, then who's got that kind of muscle?"
6,7,Castiel,I don't know. You have no memory of your resurrection?
6,7,Sam,I woke up in a field. That's all I got.
6,7,Dean,No clues? None?
6,7,Sam,I've got one.
6,7,Dean,"Gramps throw a barbecue, leave us off the e-vite list?"
6,7,Christian,Sam! [Laughs] Ahh. Dean.
6,7,Dean,"Hello, Newman. Where's the man?"
6,7,Samuel,Come right on in.
6,7,Dean,Need to ask you a few questions.
6,7,Samuel,What's wrong?
6,7,Dean,"The day you got back, what happened?"
6,7,Samuel,We've been over this.
6,7,Dean,"Well, recap it for our wingman."
6,7,Samuel,This Castiel? You're scrawnier than I pictured.
6,7,Castiel,This is a vessel. My true form is approximately the size of your Chrysler building.
6,7,Dean,"All right, all right, quit bragging. So, you were dead, and..."
6,7,Samuel,"And, pow, I was on Elton ridge. Don't know how. Don't know why. I got nothing to hide, guys."
6,7,Dean,"Well, you mind if Cas here double-checks?"
6,7,Sam,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay."
6,7,Christian,What the hell?
6,7,Dean,Angel cavity search.
6,7,Samuel,"I'm fine, Christian. Just give us a minute."
6,7,Christian,But --
6,7,Samuel,Just give us a minute.
6,7,Samuel,What the hell was that about?
6,7,Castiel,His soul is intact.
6,7,Samuel,"What? Of course I have a -- What's going on, Sam?"
6,7,Sam,Whatever dragged me out... left a piece behind.
6,7,Sam,Did you know?
6,7,Samuel,"No, but I... I knew it was something. I... You're a hell of a hunter, Sam, but... the truth is, sometimes you scare me. So, what's the deal here? How do we fix this? How do we get his soul back?"
6,7,Dean,"We don't know yet, but we have to."
6,7,Samuel,"Well, I'm here to help, of course. What leads you working?"
6,7,Sam,A bunch of dead ends and you.
6,7,Samuel,"Well, then, we'll just have to dig."
6,7,Castiel,"Sam, Dean... I have to get back."
6,7,Dean,You're leaving?
6,7,Castiel,I'm in the middle of a civil war.
6,7,Dean,"You better tear the attic up, find something to help Sam."
6,7,Castiel,Of course. Your problems always come first. I'll be in touch.
6,7,Samuel,Would've asked him to stick around for a beer.
6,7,Dean,"So, what's with the book club outside?"
6,7,Samuel,Putting together a hunt.
6,7,Dean,That's a lot of guys for one hunt.
6,7,Sam,"You found him, didn't you?"
6,7,Dean,Who?
6,7,Sam,He's got a lead on the alpha vamp.
6,7,Dean,Do you?
6,7,Samuel,Maybe. Yeah.
6,7,Dean,How'd you track him down?
6,7,Samuel,We're good.
6,7,Dean,"That's all I get? ""We're good""?"
6,7,Sam,When's the run?
6,7,Samuel,Dawn.
6,7,Sam,You didn't call me? Why?
6,7,Dean,"'Cause of me. You don't trust me very much, do you? Especially when it comes to big game like this."
6,7,Samuel,That's not true.
6,7,Dean,"Okay, well, then, we're in."
6,7,Samuel,"No offense, but --"
6,7,Dean,So you don't trust me.
6,7,Samuel,"No, I just don't know you. Not like I know Sam."
6,7,Dean,All right. You call the plays. 100%. I'm here to listen.
6,7,Samuel,[Chuckles] Since when?
6,7,Dean,Big daddy bloodsucker? I ain't gonna miss that. But this is your deal. Okay? I get it. I'll follow your lead. I trust you.
6,7,Dean,I don't trust him. Dude's hiding something.
6,7,Sam,What?
6,7,Dean,"I can feel it. And if you weren't Robo-Sam, you'd feel it, too."
6,7,Sam,Huh.
6,7,Dean,What?
6,7,Sam,Just...You. Saying you don't trust family.
6,7,Dean,"Look, we hang close, we blend in, we see what we can pick up."
6,7,Sam,You think Samuel's connected to this whole soul thing?
6,7,Dean,I still think he's the only lead we got.
6,7,Christian,"You lost, Dean?"
6,7,Dean,Had to make a phone call. Just needed some privacy.
6,7,Christian,Oh. Samuel's locked office is pretty private.
6,7,Dean,Wasn't locked.
6,7,Christian,Who you calling?
6,7,Dean,Your wife. Let her know I'm not gonna make it over tonight.
6,7,Christian,"You know, I've tried playing nice, Dean, but I think I'm done."
6,7,Dean,"Wait, are you trying to tell me that you're a bigger knob than you've been letting on?"
6,7,Christian,"I'm the guy who's been here, doing my job. Who are you? You think we need you here? You walk around like you're playing pro tennis. Only action you seen lately is between your slut girlfriend's legs."
6,7,Christian,You sure you want to come with us tomorrow? Accidents happen.
6,7,Dean,"Hmm. Don't worry, man. I got your back."
6,7,Samuel,The house is just over the hill. About a dozen vamps and the alpha. We got one shot at this son of a bitch.
6,7,Samuel,"Christian, take flank. The rest of you are with me and Sam. Dean, Gwen... hang back, sweep any stragglers we flush out. Problem, Dean?"
6,7,Dean,"No, sir."
6,7,Gwen,I'm in the rear with the reject?
6,7,Samuel,"All right, let's go."
6,7,Sam,Don't worry. It's fine.
6,7,Dean,"No, nothing's fine. You're not fine. Go. Go."
6,7,Gwen,"Sorry about the ""reject"" thing."
6,7,Dean,"Ah, I've been called worse."
6,7,Gwen,"Just, uh, get sick of getting left behind. Think it's probably 'cause I remind him of his daughter or something."
6,7,Dean,"Well, you just speak your mind."
6,7,Gwen,I'll take that as a compliment.
6,7,Dean,You should.
6,7,Gwen,You're welcome.
6,7,Gwen,We're supposed to wait here!
6,7,Girl,Dean!
6,7,Samuel,Sam!
6,7,Samuel,"Careful, now!"
6,7,Sam,Yeah. Got him.
6,7,Samuel,Get in.
6,7,Gwen,Where were you?
6,7,Samuel,Everything all right here?
6,7,Gwen,"Just, uh, chopped up a runner. No big deal. How'd it go?"
6,7,Samuel,"Rough, but one alpha down."
6,7,Dean,Where is it? Want to pay my last respects.
6,7,Samuel,"Well, bring marshmallows. Already on the pyre."
6,7,Dean,Things go okay back there?
6,7,Sam,Fine.
6,7,Dean,Nothing weird?
6,7,Dean,"I saw you walk that alpha out the door, Sam. Now, call me crazy... But that seems weird."
6,7,Sam,[Sighs] Oh.
6,7,Dean,"""Oh."""
6,7,Sam,You weren't supposed to know about that.
6,7,Dean,Know what?
6,7,Sam,"It's just something Samuel's been doing. Catching things, taking them somewhere, grilling them for info."
6,7,Dean,"Grill. Torture, right? And not telling me -- that was his idea?"
6,7,Sam,"No, it was mine."
6,7,Dean,Why?
6,7,Sam,"Honestly? 'Cause you'd mess it up. You shoot first, ask questions later, and we needed to ask questions."
6,7,Dean,"You know, I-I don't care if you've got soullessness or the freakin' mumps, man -- You know better than this! Do you even want your soul back?"
6,7,Sam,How does that have anything to do --
6,7,Dean,"Have you been to the place where Samuel takes them? I mean, have you been in on these interrogations?"
6,7,Sam,"No, but I hear --"
6,7,Dean,And why? And did it ever occur to you that this is really shady?
6,7,Sam,He's our grandfather.
6,7,Dean,"Yeah. Yeah, a guy who talks a great game. But you can't assume that family means the same thing to him as it does to us. He's not Dad. Wow. You don't see it, do you?"
6,7,Sam,What?
6,7,Dean,"You've got no instinct. [Scoffs] I mean, you are seriously messed up."
6,7,Sam,Thanks.
6,7,Dean,"I'm not kidding, man. Nobody's forcing you to work with me, okay? But if we do this... I drive the bus, I call the shots, and you tell me everything, whether you think it's important or not, because -- trust me -- you can't tell the difference. Or, you know what, go -- go with Samuel. See how that goes. It's up to you."
6,7,Sam,Samuel?
6,7,Samuel,"Damn, kid. Learn how to knock. Where's your brother?"
6,7,Sam,Gone.
6,7,Samuel,"What do you mean, ""gone""?"
6,7,Sam,"I mean he left about an hour ago. He and I just weren't seeing eye-to-eye anymore, I guess."
6,7,Samuel,That's too bad.
6,7,Sam,I want in.
6,7,Samuel,In?
6,7,Sam,"On the interrogations, on everything. I can help. This family -- this is it for me now. Whatever you need, I'll do."
6,7,Samuel,"Yeah, I know you will."
6,7,Sam,Great.
6,7,Samuel,"But until we can figure out this soul business of yours, I need you to keep doing what you're doing."
6,7,Sam,But I can --
6,7,Samuel,No you can't.
6,7,Samuel,I'm sorry.
6,7,Sam,Right.
6,7,Dean,Hey.
6,7,Sam,You didn't think I'd come back.
6,7,Dean,I figured 60/40.
6,7,Sam,"So, Samuel didn't take the bait. So I went with plan ""b."""
6,7,Dean,"We had a plan ""b""?"
6,7,Sam,Fired up the GPS on one of his cellphones. We should be able to track him right to the alpha.
6,7,Dean,The old man won't notice?
6,7,Sam,Trust me. He thinks Velcro is big news.
6,7,Sam,There. Got him.
6,7,Sam,Dead man's blood?
6,7,Dean,Smart. Lock the place down with vamp repellent.
6,7,Samuel,Where is it? Answer the question. Where is it? How do we find it?
6,7,Alpha Vampire,Ouch. Stop. That hurts [spoken in a sarcastic manner].
6,7,Samuel,This -- This is club med compared to what we have planned for you. I got -- I got all the time in the world.
6,7,Alpha Vampire,"Well, that makes two of us."
6,7,Alpha Vampire,"Are you two going to hide all night? Come on out, boys."
6,7,Alpha Vampire,How can I help you?
6,7,Dean,"We got some questions for you, skippy, since you're going nowhere fast."
6,7,Alpha Vampire,Don't be so sure.
6,7,Dean,"Yeah? Locked down pretty tight. And with all that dead blood rushing through your veins, not sure you got enough juice to fire up that psychic bat-signal of yours, do you?"
6,7,Alpha Vampire,True. Not near enough juice for that... Dean.
6,7,Dean,I didn't realize we were on a first-name basis.
6,7,Alpha Vampire,"Of course we are. After all, you were my child... for a time. Dean, tell me... did you enjoy it?"
6,7,Dean,"I'm asking the questions here, fright night."
6,7,Alpha Vampire,"When your kind first huddled around the fire, I was the thing in the dark! Now you think you can hurt me? I have all night, boys. Anyway, I'm happy to tell you whatever you want to know."
6,7,Sam,Why?
6,7,Alpha Vampire,"Why? Because soon, I'll be ankle-deep in your blood, sucking the marrow from your bones."
6,7,Sam,So you're really it. The first of your species.
6,7,Alpha Vampire,The very first.
6,7,Sam,But if you're the first... who made you?
6,7,Alpha Vampire,We all have our mothers. Even me.
6,7,Dean,What does that mean?
6,7,Dean,"And what's with the big surge of vamps lately? I mean, it's like --"
6,7,Alpha Vampire,Like we're going to war.
6,7,Sam,Why? What's going on? Why did Samuel bring you here?
6,7,Alpha Vampire,You smell cold. You have no soul. What an oddity. Do you feel how empty you are? What is it like to have no soul? Answer my question.
6,7,Sam,You first. You're the one in the cage.
6,7,Alpha Vampire,"The thing about souls -- If you've got one, of course -- is they're predictable. You die, you go up or down. Where do my kind go?"
6,7,Dean,"All right, enough with the sermon, freak."
6,7,Alpha Vampire,"I'm trying to answer the question. Now, when we ""freaks"" die... where do we go? Not heaven, not hell. So?"
6,7,Dean,Legoland?
6,7,Alpha Vampire,"[Sighs] Little rusty on our Dante, boys?"
6,7,Sam,Purgatory.
6,7,Dean,Purgatory? Purgatory's real?
6,7,Alpha Vampire,"Oh, stupid cattle. [Chuckles] Of course! And it is filled with the soul of every hungry thing like me that ever walked this earth. Now, where is it? That is the mystery. And that is what your kindhearted granddaddy is trying to beat out of me."
6,7,Sam,Samuel brought you here... to find out where Purgatory is?
6,7,Alpha Vampire,I keep telling him -- how would I know such a thing? But he refuses to untie me.
6,7,Sam,You know exactly where it is. Why does Samuel care about any of this?
6,7,Alpha Vampire,He doesn't care. He does as he is told.
6,7,Dean,"Well, if the old man's Kermit... whose hand's up his ass?"
6,7,Samuel,"Evening, guys."
6,7,Dean,"Wow, you know, I have seen some stupid in my time, but you take the crown. Putting Jaws in a fishbowl? How do you think that's gonna end? I don't know what kind of game you're running --"
6,7,Samuel,"What, do you think I'm doing this for kicks?"
6,7,Dean,"I think you've got the rest of these feebs convinced that you're John Wayne. So whatever you're doing, whatever you're hiding... it's gonna put you and everyone around you in the ground."
6,7,Gwen,Hi.
6,7,Dean,Gwen. [Sighs] And I thought we had something special.
6,7,Alpha Vampire,Are you scared of me? I would be.
6,7,Alpha Vampire,Go ahead. [The Alpha Vampire escapes the cage].
6,7,Samuel,Grab your stuff.
6,7,Dean,How long till the alpha's 100%?
6,7,Samuel,Hour. Maybe less.
6,7,Samuel,We need to get him dosed up and back in the cage.
6,7,Dean,No.
6,7,Samuel,"What do you mean, ""no""?"
6,7,Dean,"I mean, I don't know what your big plan was, but playing catch is not on the table."
6,7,Samuel,Dean --
6,7,Dean,"We take the thing's head off, or it kills us all! You know that."
6,7,Dean,"Okay. We split up. Clear every room. You get a shot, you take it. It's not gonna kill him, but dude will move a lot slower without any kneecaps. And if we make it through this, you, me, and Sam are having one hell of a family meeting."
6,7,Christian,You think he ran out?
6,7,Samuel,No!
6,7,Alpha Vampire,"The boy with no soul. I've got big plans for you. It's amazing how that pesky, little soul gets in the way. But not for you. You will be the perfect... animal."
6,7,Sam,Christian?
6,7,Crowley,"Well, that was dramatic."
6,7,Sam,Crowley?
6,7,Crowley,"Hello, boys. What an unexpected treat."
6,7,Samuel,Bring Christian back now.
6,7,Crowley,I'm sorry?
6,7,Samuel,My nephew! The one you just crammed a demon into!
6,7,Crowley,"Oh. No. I had him possessed ages ago. Samuel, really. I keep an eye on my investments."
6,7,Dean,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. You two know each other?"
6,7,Crowley,"Not in the biblical sense. More of a business relationship, I'd say."
6,7,Sam,You're Crowley's bitch.
6,7,Samuel,It's not what you think.
6,7,Crowley,It's precisely what you think. That alpha he's caught me is getting him a gold star.
6,7,Dean,Since when do you give a crap about vampires?
6,7,Crowley,"Since, uh... What's today -- Friday? Since, let's see -- mind your business."
6,7,Sam,"You may as well share with the class, Crowley. We know you're looking for Purgatory."
6,7,Crowley,So you heard about that?
6,7,Sam,Yeah. You want to tell us why?
6,7,Crowley,"Isn't it obvious? Location, location, location. I'm a developer. Purgatory is vast, underutilized, and hell-adjacent, and I want it."
6,7,Dean,What for?
6,7,Crowley,Best shut your gob. Employees don't question management.
6,7,Dean,We ain't your employees.
6,7,Crowley,"Of course you are! Have been for some time now, thanks to gramps. I don't keep Captain Chromedome around for his wit, do I? Samuel knows things. More than any of you, actually. Walking encyclopedia of the creepy and the crawly. And I knew... You two are so hung up on family-loyalty nonsense, he said jump, you'd get froggy."
6,7,Dean,"Yeah, well, the game's over."
6,7,Crowley,"Yeah, well, afraid not, not if you want to see Sam's soul ever again."
6,7,Sam,You're bluffing.
6,7,Crowley,"Tell them, Samuel."
6,7,Samuel,"He pulled us both back, me and Sam."
6,7,Sam,What? You knew?
6,7,Dean,"No, Cas says it takes big-time mojo to pull something like that off, and you're nothing but a punk-ass crossroads demon."
6,7,Crowley,"Was a punk-ass crossroads demon. Now? King of hell. Believe me, I've got the mojo. I snap my fingers, Sam gets his soul back. Or you can be...You, and I shove Sam right back in the hole. Can't imagine what it's like in there... and I can imagine so many things. So, we clear? Me, Charlie... you, angels. Job's simple enough -- bring me creatures. Aim high on the food chain, please. Everybody wins. It's been a pleasure. See you soon."
6,7,Gwen,You're letting a demon call the shots?
6,7,Samuel,"Nothing's changed. We hunt. Period. Don't worry about him. I'll take care of it. You trust me or not? Get the van, Gwen."
6,7,Sam,"Working with a demon, huh?"
6,7,Sam,You're not who I thought you were.
6,7,Samuel,"You don't know anything about me, son."
6,7,Dean,"So, what's so important that you're the king of hell's cabana boy, huh? What'd he offer you? Girls? Money? Hair?"
6,7,Samuel,"I got my reasons. You gonna make a move, go ahead."
6,7,Dean,Or what?
6,7,Samuel,"Or nothing. I'm not gonna do anything to you, Dean. You boys... you're my family. So the way I see it, you got two choices -- Put a bullet in your grandfather or step aside."
6,7,Sam,He sold us out.
6,7,Dean,I know.
6,7,Dean,Let it go.
6,7,Sam,Why?
6,7,Dean,Get out of here.
6,7,Sam,"So, what now?"
6,7,Dean,We can't work for Crowley.
6,7,Sam,Are you sure about that?
6,7,Dean,I don't think you understand. Demons bone you every time.
6,7,Sam,"Oh, no, I get it. I do, believe me."
6,7,Sam,Just running the math -- Do we really have another choice?
6,7,Dean,We could stab him in his throat.
6,7,Sam,"And get my soul back how? I'm just saying, seems like we got to play ball, at least for the moment."
6,7,Dean,"I have done some stupid things in my time, but punching a demon's clock?"
6,7,Sam,"Look, just till we find another way."
6,7,Dean,And then?
6,7,Sam,"And then we track Crowley down and give that son of a bitch what's coming to him. You with me, Dean?"
6,8,CROWLEY,"Crowley thinks you're just gonna what, Dean?"
6,8,CROWLEY,Is that Bobby Singer? Give him a kiss for me.
6,8,CROWLEY,"Good news, boys! I've got a job for you."
6,8,DEAN,I'm gonna say this once. You can take your job and shove it up your ass.
6,8,CROWLEY,Is that any way to talk to your boss?
6,8,DEAN,"You're not my boss, dickbag."
6,8,CROWLEY,"Dean, Dean. Been through this. Quit clutching your pearls. You've been working for me for some time now. Sam here, longer."
6,8,SAM,We didn't know.
6,8,CROWLEY,Like that makes a difference to you. You'd sell your brother for a dollar right now if you really needed a soda.
6,8,CROWLEY,"Look, I'm sending you –"
6,8,DEAN,No.
6,8,CROWLEY,Beg pardon?
6,8,DEAN,"I've done some shady stuff in my time, but I am not doing this. No."
6,8,CROWLEY,Ten quid says you will.
6,8,CROWLEY,"You like pain, Sam? You like Hell?"
6,8,CROWLEY,"You need to stop thinking of this as some kind of deal. This is a hostage situation, you arrogant little thug. I own your brother! Do you understand me?"
6,8,CROWLEY,"Come on, Dean, smile. It's not that bad. Here's incentive – you bag me a live alpha, and I'll give you little Sammy's soul back, with a cherry on top."
6,8,SAM,"What, alpha vamp not good enough for you?"
6,8,CROWLEY,"Best mind where you poke your nose, if you want to keep it. Your merry little hike up the food chain starts here."
6,8,CROWLEY,Businessman found dead in his car – chest ripped open...
6,8,CROWLEY,...heart missing. Sounds like?
6,8,SAM,Werewolf.
6,8,DEAN,"No, it's not a full moon."
6,8,CROWLEY,Werewolves turning on the full moon – so '09.
6,8,SAM,"He's right. Samuel and I ganked one about six months back on the half-moon. Things have been out of whack for a while now, I guess."
6,8,DEAN,"Yeah, I guess."
6,8,CROWLEY,"So, it's settled then. You bag the howler, bring it home to papa. See you soon, boys."
6,8,SAM,"So, the vic's a real class act. Owned a bunch of slum-grade apartments. Couple houses, too."
6,8,DEAN,So this is it? This is – this is what you're gonna do?
6,8,SAM,What am I doing?
6,8,DEAN,"Crowley. He's so far up our asses we're – we're – we're coughing sulfur, but you – you're just gonna work the case?"
6,8,SAM,"Well, he's got us by the short and curlies. What else are we supposed to do?"
6,8,DEAN,"It's just – you know, man, I... I'm working for a demon now. I don't even know who you are. I just... I just need a second to adjust."
6,8,SAM,"Look... this is a crap situation. I get it. But, Dean, I am still me – same melon, same memories. I-I still like the same music. I still think about Suzie Heizer."
6,8,DEAN,Biology class Suzie Heizer?
6,8,SAM,"Can you blame me? Look, I know you don't trust me. And I can't take back what I did. But I'm going to prove it to you. I'm still your brother."
6,8,MAN 1,Okay.
6,8,MAN 2,I got it.
6,8,DEAN,How you doing? Agents Holt and Wilson.
6,8,DETECTIVE,Feds?
6,8,SAM,Yeah.
6,8,DETECTIVE,What are the Feds doing here?
6,8,SAM,"Oh, we're specialists. They call us in to answer the questions of mouth-breathing dick monkeys."
6,8,SAM,"So, you gonna walk us through this, or, uh..."
6,8,DETECTIVE,Dock worker. Guy on the morning shift found him – chest ripped wide open.
6,8,DEAN,Same as the body in the car?
6,8,DETECTIVE,"Yeah, second one in two days."
6,8,SAM,Internal organs missing on both vics? Like their hearts?
6,8,DETECTIVE,"Uh... looks like it, yeah. How'd you know?"
6,8,SAM,"So, this guy, he – he have any enemies?"
6,8,DETECTIVE,"Yeah, plenty, but, uh, I don't think it was a wolf or possibly a cougar that had a beef with the guy. You do realize these were animal attacks?"
6,8,DEAN,"An animal out here. What, you think it came for the sailing?"
6,8,SAM,Morning.
6,8,DEAN,You didn't sleep. 'Cause you don't... sleep.
6,8,SAM,Right.
6,8,DEAN,Yeah. That's not creepy at all.
6,8,SAM,"Not like I can help it. So, you gonna just lay there staring at me..."
6,8,SAM,...or you want to hear what I dug up?
6,8,SAM,"All right. So, we know that werewolves are basically id gone wild, right? I mean, whoever they hate, they kill when they wolf out. So, I've been playing connect the victims."
6,8,DEAN,And?
6,8,SAM,And I think I found a common denominator. So come on. Uh...
6,8,SAM,"Get the lead out, huh?"
6,8,DEAN,"Let me get dressed, Robocop."
6,8,WOMAN,"Yes, can I help you?"
6,8,SAM,Is Cal Garrigan at home? We've got a few questions we'd like to ask him.
6,8,WOMAN,"[with a smile] Yeah. Um, come in."
6,8,WOMAN,"Honey, um, why don't you go play in your room for a little while, okay?"
6,8,WOMAN,Excuse the mess. Please sit.
6,8,WOMAN,Um... can I get you guys anything?
6,8,DEAN,"No, thank you. Um, so Cal is your boyfriend?"
6,8,WOMAN,That's right.
6,8,DEAN,And where is he?
6,8,WOMAN,"Uh, sleeping, I think."
6,8,DEAN,You mind telling him up and at 'em? He's got some guests.
6,8,WOMAN,"Yeah. Yeah, of course."
6,8,WOMAN,Cal...
6,8,CAL,"Lucky, shh!"
6,8,WOMAN,These are Agents...
6,8,DEAN,Holt and Wilson. Morning... ish.
6,8,CAL,Hey. What's this?
6,8,DEAN,"You out late last night, Cal?"
6,8,CAL,"Just, uh, you know, a couple beers with friends."
6,8,DEAN,How many's a couple?
6,8,CAL,"I don't know. Three, four tops."
6,8,SAM,"If all you had was beer, then how come you're sweating vodka? And looks to me like you slept in those clothes. Am I right?"
6,8,CAL,I don't know. I – I guess.
6,8,DEAN,"So what you're saying is, you got blind drunk, you blacked out. Something tells me this isn't the first time."
6,8,SAM,"So, Cal, truthfully, who knows what you've really been up to at night?"
6,8,CAL,"Look, what's this about?"
6,8,SAM,We're investigating the death of Ronald Garrigan.
6,8,CAL,My brother?
6,8,DEAN,Sorry for your loss.
6,8,CAL,"Yeah, I thought that was some kind of animal attack."
6,8,SAM,"No love lost between the two of you, huh?"
6,8,CAL,"Look, we had our differences, I guess. You love your brother, of course, but... Ron had a lot of problems. He was, uh, volatile."
6,8,SAM,"Last time he was here, you called the cops?"
6,8,CAL,"Yeah, look, he came in here all messed up, and he was yelling. He shoved Mandy. So, yeah, I called the cops. I don't see how that has to do with –"
6,8,SAM,Your landlord was found dead this week. Were you aware of that?
6,8,CAL,Saw it in the papers. Why?
6,8,SAM,"Well, you two were pretty far behind on your rent, right? He had sent eviction papers?"
6,8,MANDY,I – I'm sorry. That was an animal attack.
6,8,SAM,"Funny enough, yeah – both of 'em were."
6,8,CAL,"So, great, great. Yeah, guys. What in the hell do you think I had to do with 'em?"
6,8,DEAN,Just following procedure. Had to ask. You two have a good day.
6,8,SAM,"So, Cal's a prince."
6,8,DEAN,"Yeah, doesn't even know where he was last night."
6,8,SAM,Bag him now?
6,8,DEAN,No. We make sure.
6,8,SAM,Really?
6,8,DEAN,"Before we hand him over to a lifetime of demon rape? Yeah, really."
6,8,SAM,"Boy, Cal just doesn't know when to quit."
6,8,DEAN,"Three scuzzy bars, one scuzzy strip club, a chili-dog joint, seven or eight nightcaps, and now... scotches in the library. I'm getting cirrhosis just watching this. Other than that, we got squat."
6,8,SAM,Let's just see.
6,8,DEAN,"Dude, sun's up."
6,8,DEAN,This guy's still on two legs. In theory. He ain't wolfing out.
6,8,SAM,"Well, not tonight, anyway."
6,8,DEAN,Let's head back. We can re-attack this in a couple hours.
6,8,CAL,"Catch you later, man."
6,8,CAL,Lucky. What are you doing?
6,8,CAL,No!
6,8,CAL,No!
6,8,MANDY,"Oh, ew, Lucky, that's enough. [calls out] Cal? [more quietly] Typical."
6,8,MANDY,"Oh, Lucky. Honestly."
6,8,MANDY,You are the only decent boyfriend I have ever had.
6,8,DEAN,I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that it's not Cal.
6,8,SAM,"Masterful deduction, Sherlock."
6,8,DEAN,"I mean, a werewolf attack in daylight? This whole thing is just weird."
6,8,SAM,"Dogs and cats living together – mass hysteria. So, you know this means that we're down to one suspect, right?"
6,8,DEAN,I know.
6,8,SAM,"I mean, Mandy is right at the deep end of the vic pool. Can you do it?"
6,8,DEAN,Do what?
6,8,SAM,"Shove her in the trunk, serve her up to Crowley."
6,8,DEAN,"Yeah, Sam, I can do it."
6,8,MANDY,"You still feeling hot, baby?"
6,8,MANDY’S SON,Mm-hmm.
6,8,MANDY,"Here, have some juice. Make you feel better."
6,8,MANDY’S SON,Okay.
6,8,MANDY,"Hey, see? Lucky knows you're not feeling well, and he wants you to feel better."
6,8,MANDY,"He loves you, doesn't he? There's a good boy."
6,8,MANDY,There's a good boy.
6,8,MANDY’S SON,He loves a squeak.
6,8,MANDY,Yeah.
6,8,MANDY,Uh-oh.
6,8,MANDY’S SON,The leg broke off.
6,8,MANDY,"Lucky, look what you did!"
6,8,MANDY,"What, am I interrupting the morning show? Come on. Let's go for a walk."
6,8,MANDY,"Hey, is that blood? Have you killed a bird again? Bad dog!"
6,8,WOMAN,Three o’clock? Does that work?
6,8,MANDY,Okay.
6,8,WOMAN,Okay.
6,8,MANDY,See you later.
6,8,WOMAN,See you then.
6,8,GIRL,Bye.
6,8,MANDY,Bye.
6,8,DEAN,Ma'am.
6,8,MANDY,Agents. What are you doing here?
6,8,DEAN,Nobody called you?
6,8,MANDY,Called me about what?
6,8,MANDY,I'm sorry. I just can't believe it.
6,8,DEAN,I'm really very sorry.
6,8,SAM,"Ma'am, I know this isn't the best time, but we'd like you to come with us."
6,8,MANDY,Why? You think I have something to do with this? With Cal?
6,8,DEAN,"Of course not. We just got a few questions – i's and t's, mostly."
6,8,MANDY,"I, uh... Could we do it later?"
6,8,SAM,I'm afraid not.
6,8,MANDY,"Oh. Uh – uh, my kid has the flu, um, and he was up all night, so –"
6,8,SAM,"Well, is there a neighbor or a friend who can watch him while you're gone?"
6,8,DEAN,I'm sorry. You said your boy was up all night?
6,8,MANDY,"Uh, yeah."
6,8,DEAN,Were you with him all night?
6,8,MANDY,"Um – uh – well, I had, um, half an hour of sleep, maybe."
6,8,DEAN,Can I talk to your son?
6,8,MANDY,Why?
6,8,SAM,"Yeah, what difference does that make, Agent Holt?"
6,8,DEAN,[to SAM] Trust me. It's important. [to MANDY] Please?
6,8,DEAN,"Well, it wasn't her."
6,8,SAM,You don't know that.
6,8,DEAN,She's got an alibi.
6,8,SAM,She's lying.
6,8,DEAN,"You heard the kid, dude. She's not lying."
6,8,SAM,"Fine. She still had time to wolf out, Dean. The last werewolf was in bed, with me, and she wolfed out."
6,8,DEAN,"Don't make this personal. Look, all I'm saying is that between this and the daylight attacks, something's not adding up."
6,8,DEAN,I'm not just gonna hand her over to Crowley until we figure out what. You understand?
6,8,SAM,"Okay. Okay. I understand. How 'bout you go check out Cal's crime scene, see if we're missing anything. I'll come back and keep an eye on Amanda."
6,8,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, how 'bout you go and I'll stay here?"
6,8,SAM,"Dean, I still know how to do my job. I'm just gonna watch her. That's all. Trust me."
6,8,DEAN,Uh-huh.
6,8,MAN,It’s okay.
6,8,WOMAN,It’s okay.
6,8,MAN,"It’ll be okay, boy."
6,8,WOMAN,Oh...
6,8,MAN,We gotta find a vet.
6,8,WOMAN,"Hurry, hurry!"
6,8,SAM,Hey!
6,8,SAM,"Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait! Mister! Hey, mister, wait! That's my dog!"
6,8,SAM,That's my dog.
6,8,DEAN,"Hiya, Lucky. Bad dog."
6,8,DEAN,First things first.
6,8,DEAN,You see this? This is silver. Don't say I didn't warn you.
6,8,DEAN,"Okay, time to go. Now, we can either do this the easy way –"
6,8,DEAN,Hmm?
6,8,DEAN,Or the hard way.
6,8,SAM,"What? Soul or not, that's funny."
6,8,SAM,"Well, I got to tell you, Lucky, you got us stumped. I mean, why shack up with the family? Is it a kinky thing? Do you like to play with your food? Roll over, Lucky. Speak."
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),Go to hell.
6,8,SAM,"Already been. Didn't agree with me. So, look..."
6,8,SAM,"...how about I take this silver knife, and start carving some dog until you behave?"
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),You do what you got to do.
6,8,DEAN,"Hang on, Sam. [to LUCKY (MAN)] Listen, you don't have to tell me why you're with the family. I get it."
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Oh, you do, do you?"
6,8,DEAN,"You killed every threat that came near them. You care about them, in your own whack-a-doodle kind of way. It's obvious. What I want to know is, who was that guy you were kibitzing with? He a skinwalker, too?"
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Look, I can't say anything."
6,8,DEAN,"But if you don't, then you're gonna put the girl and the little boy in danger. And sooner or later, all this crap is gonna come for them. Now, look –"
6,8,DEAN,We don't give a rat's ass about you. We want to help them. That's our angle. That's it.
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"[after a pause] Yeah, that guy, he's a... whatever it is I am. And he's not the only one."
6,8,SAM,How many are you?
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),About 30. We were all -- we were kind of recruited.
6,8,SAM,Recruited?
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Yeah. Me, I was living on the streets. They found me. They told me one small bite, I'd be strong, I'd be fast."
6,8,DEAN,"Sniffing people's butts? Yeah, that's a real step up."
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Well, it was for me."
6,8,DEAN,Where is this little Scooby gang of yours?
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Everywhere. We're out there finding families, and once they take us in, we lay low."
6,8,DEAN,"""Lay low""? What the hell's that mean?"
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Well, we're waiting for the word."
6,8,DEAN,What word?
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Once we're settled, we get the signal... and we all turn on our families. We change them, all in one night. 30 becomes 150."
6,8,DEAN,"God, you're a sleeper cell."
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Yeah, well, that's one way to say it."
6,8,SAM,So you're waiting for word from who? Who organized you?
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),There's a pack leader.
6,8,SAM,Your Alpha?
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),What's an Alpha?
6,8,SAM,"The – the first skinwalker, the strongest."
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Well, he's plenty strong, but, no, I – I don't think so. I'm pretty sure there's guys like him in other towns. We're not the only pack out there."
6,8,DEAN,Fantastic. Then you can help us stop him.
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Oh, no, I can't. No."
6,8,DEAN,"Yes, you can."
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"No, you guys don't get it. No one can. These guys who turned me – they're ruthless."
6,8,DEAN,"Sam, not helping."
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Fetch this, dick."
6,8,DEAN,Listen to me.
6,8,DEAN,"What are you gonna do to that family, really? You gonna put your jaws around that little boy's throat? Clamp down, listen to him cry for his mom? 'Cause I'm gonna guess that these are the only people who in your pathetic life have ever showed you any kindness. So it's either that... or you can help us stop it."
6,8,SAM,So... How are we supposed to get near something that can smell us a hundred yards off?
6,8,DEAN,We don't.
6,8,SAM,The pack leader. We're taking him down?
6,8,DEAN,Yeah. Got a better idea?
6,8,SAM,"No, I... Crowley's not gonna be too happy about that."
6,8,DEAN,"Who gives a rat's ass? We let that thing live one second, and it sends out that psychic dog whistle and [hand motions] phew!"
6,8,SAM,"On the other hand, it could lead us to an Alpha. Then Crowley would give me my soul back."
6,8,DEAN,Are you kidding? 150 people turned into monsters. That's what you want?
6,8,SAM,No. Of course not. I... I'm just asking.
6,8,DEAN,"All right, you know what? That's it."
6,8,SAM,What?
6,8,DEAN,"You say you're ""just folks,"" yeah? That – that you like baseball and apple pie or whatever. But truth is, I don't know what you are 'cause you're not Sam."
6,8,SAM,"Dean, come on."
6,8,DEAN,"I mean, it's your gigantor body and – and maybe your brain, but it's not you. So just... stop pretending. Do us both a favor."
6,8,SAM,"He looks nervous, right?"
6,8,DEAN,Wouldn't you be?
6,8,SAM,"I'd double-cross us. I mean, he's got to realize that's his best bet, if he wants to keep breathing."
6,8,DEAN,"Nah, he'll go through with it."
6,8,SAM,You mean 'cause he loves that family?
6,8,DEAN,Yeah.
6,8,SAM,I'd double-cross us.
6,8,DEAN,"Thanks, Dexter. That's reassuring."
6,8,SAM,Just making conversation.
6,8,DEAN,Here we go.
6,8,SAM,"That big guy, the driver – that's the guy Lucky met in the park."
6,8,DEAN,And there's El Jefe.
6,8,SAM,Take him out.
6,8,DEAN,It's not clean. We got one shot at this – literally.
6,8,SAM,Take the shot.
6,8,DEAN,I'm trying! She's in the way.
6,8,SAM,Take it anyway!
6,8,DEAN,"Come on, come on, come on. Ahh."
6,8,SAM,"So, plan B?"
6,8,DEAN,We've got one?
6,8,MANDY,"Please, whatever you want. Just please let my son go."
6,8,LARGE MAN,"Look, man, there's nothing I can do. The boss is pissed. These murders that you've been doing? You didn't ask for permission! Now you're gonna screw up the whole damn plan. I tried to warn you."
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),I know. I'm sorry.
6,8,MANDY,There – there's been a mistake. T-This has got nothing to do with us.
6,8,LARGE MAN,"It has everything to do with you, sister."
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),[whispers to LARGE MAN] Hey.
6,8,LARGE MAN,"So, you with us or not?"
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Yes, of course I am."
6,8,LARGE MAN,"Fine. Prove it. Turn them. Now. Both of 'em, while we watch, Or I'll kill you all."
6,8,MANDY,"Oh, my..."
6,8,LARGE MAN,What is that?
6,8,MANDY’S SON,Mommy!
6,8,MANDY,It's okay.
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Mandy! Come on, come on."
6,8,MANDY,Who are you? I don't even know you!
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Yes, you do. Trust me, I'm trying to help. Come on, come on!"
6,8,SAM,Dean!
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),Get in.
6,8,MANDY,But I don't –
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),Get in!
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),Bolt it! Bolt it!
6,8,MANDY,"Here, baby, go under here. Okay, stay there, honey. You'll be safe."
6,8,LARGE MAN,[to LUCKY (MAN)] You're protecting them? After what I did for you? I gave you your life back!
6,8,LARGE MAN,Them? You're nothing to them. You're a dog.
6,8,LARGE MAN,I-I was gonna turn them. But now I'm gonna kill 'em.
6,8,MANDY,Lucky?!
6,8,LARGE MAN,So you think this is gonna be a dogfight?
6,8,LARGE MAN,I got a better idea.
6,8,LARGE MAN,"Silver bullet, Lucky."
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),"Hi. One…. I'm not here to bother you. I just...Uh, I just want to say one thing. You and Aidan... You're the only family I ever had. And I know – I know that sounds – I know... I know what I am. It... it's just that no one has ever been so nice to me before, so... So, thank you."
6,8,MANDY,"Get away from this house, you psycho. And if you ever, ever come near me or my son again, so help me..."
6,8,LUCKY (MAN),I know I probably deserve...
6,8,DEAN,"I'll never look at a dog the same. Makes you wonder, though, huh?"
6,8,SAM,What?
6,8,DEAN,"How many packs are out there. What if they're all just waiting for the signal, you know?"
6,8,SAM,So...I was thinking. You were right.
6,8,DEAN,About?
6,8,SAM,I'm not your brother. I'm not Sam.
6,8,DEAN,Okay.
6,8,SAM,"Um, all that ""Blah, blah, blah,"" about being the old me? Crap. Like Lisa and Ben, right? I've been acting like I care about them. But I don't. I couldn't care less."
6,8,DEAN,Is this supposed to make me feel better?
6,8,SAM,"You wanted the real me. This is it. I don't care about them. I don't even really care about you. Except that... I need your help. And you're clearly not gonna stick around for much longer unless I give it to you straight, so... I've done a lot worse than you know. I've killed innocent people in the line of duty. But I'm pretty sure it's not something the old me could've done. And maybe I should feel guilty. But I don't."
6,8,DEAN,"Sam, get to the punch line."
6,8,SAM,"I don't know if how I am is better or worse. It's different. You get the job done, and nothing really hurts. That's not the worst thing. But I've been thinking. And it was... it was kinda harder. But there are also things about it I remember that I... Let's just say I think I should probably go back to being him."
6,8,DEAN,That's very interesting. It's a step.
6,8,SAM,So?
6,8,DEAN,We do what we got to do. And we get my brother back.
6,10,ALPHA,I told you. I don’t know anything about –
6,10,CROWLEY,Sorry. But your exceptional good looks aren’t gonna buy you any mercy. I suggest you talk. What should we use next? Speculum? Or something more exotic?
6,10,ALPHA,"Look, it’s Purgatory. All I know is I go there when I die. It’s not like I can draw you a map."
6,10,CROWLEY,I happen to know you can.
6,10,ALPHA,You’re wrong.
6,10,ALPHA,"You go ahead, mate, see if it makes me –"
6,10,ALPHA,Kill ’em all. We’ll make more.
6,10,CROWLEY,Guess I kinda lost my head.
6,10,DEMON,You’re late.
6,10,DEAN,Traffic was a bitch.
6,10,SAM,One rugaru.
6,10,DEAN,Where’s Crowley?
6,10,DEMON,Banging a hooker in a sweet spot called None Of Your Business.
6,10,DEAN,"Oh, look at that, Sam. Demon trying to be funny."
6,10,SAM,"Oh, is that what just happened?"
6,10,DEMON,"Night, girls."
6,10,DEAN,"Wait, wait. Hold up, hold up. Are we ever gonna see Crowley again or is he just gonna keep sending his demon extras to pick up his laundry?"
6,10,DEMON,"I’m sorry. I know you’re speaking, I see your lips moving, but I can’t understand what you’re saying ’cause I don’t speak Little Bitch."
6,10,DEAN,Remember when we used to gank demons?
6,10,DEAN,"No man, screw it, I’m done."
6,10,SAM,Calm down.
6,10,DEAN,We’ve been going on these freaking Crowley runs and it’s not getting us anywhere.
6,10,SAM,Dean –
6,10,DEAN,"I mean, the only thing that’s really changed, is now I need a daily rape shower."
6,10,SAM,"OK, you’re right. Let’s go with Plan B. Oh yeah, we don’t have one. So till we do, sorry dude, stock up on soap-on-a-rope. Dean, if you wanna get my soul back, that’s what we gotta do, OK?"
6,10,DEAN,Yeah… You even want it back?
6,10,SAM,"I’m working for Crowley, aren’t I?"
6,10,DEAN,What now?
6,10,SAM,I think I know who you can ask.
6,10,DEAN,Evil bitch.
6,10,MEG,"Keep sweet talking me, this could go a whole new direction."
6,10,DEAN,Meg. I’ve been dying to see you again.
6,10,MEG,"Well, here I am, big boy. So, what should we do now?"
6,10,DEAN,How about I rip you to shreds?
6,10,MEG,"Kinky, I like. A little Q&A first, if you don’t mind. Now, where’s your boss?"
6,10,SAM,You think we work for somebody?
6,10,MEG,I happen to know for a fact you’ve been juggling Crowley’s orphans. Now where is he?
6,10,SAM,Don’t know. Don’t care.
6,10,MEG,You’ve been working his beat for months.
6,10,SAM,Doesn’t mean we get face time.
6,10,DEAN,"Something funny, Sam?"
6,10,SAM,"Yeah, Meg."
6,10,DEAN,Really? ’Cause where I’m sitting…
6,10,SAM,Don’t worry. She can’t do jack squat. She’s totally screwed.
6,10,DEAN,"Sam, not helping!"
6,10,SAM,"Look at her, Dean. She’s furious. If she could kill you, she’d’ve done it by now. She’s running."
6,10,MEG,Am I?
6,10,SAM,"Judging by the level of flop sweat on all of you, yeah. Which means you’re running from Crowley. Which makes sense. Crowley would want to hunt down all the Lucifer loyalists now that he’s the big man on campus."
6,10,MEG,How would you know?
6,10,DEAN,"Well, I hope you both lose. But good luck."
6,10,SAM,"So, you know what you gotta do now, right?"
6,10,MEG,Let me guess. You’re gonna tell me.
6,10,SAM,Work with us.
6,10,DEAN,"Whoa, what?"
6,10,MEG,What?
6,10,SAM,"Doesn’t matter. Question is, can you get us what we need?"
6,10,MEG,"I apprenticed under Alastair in Hell just like your brother. So Dean, can I make Crowley do whatever I want?"
6,10,DEAN,"Yeah, she can."
6,10,MEG,It’s a deal then. Hugs and puppies all around!
6,10,DEAN,You gonna untie us?
6,10,MEG,Please. Don’t pretend you don’t enjoy it.
6,10,DEAN,You gonna kiss me?
6,10,DEAN,What are you doing?
6,10,SAM,What do you mean?
6,10,DEAN,"I mean, what are you doing!?"
6,10,SAM,"Dean, you wanted to screw over Crowley. Merry Christmas. What?"
6,10,DEAN,You wanna work with a demon again?
6,10,SAM,We’re working with demons now. I’m doing this because I wanna stop.
6,10,DEAN,She killed Ellen and Jo!
6,10,SAM,"I know. But you can’t look at his emotionally, Dean. We need her."
6,10,DEAN,The hell we do! That little bitch is gonna screw us over so fast –
6,10,SAM,Of course. Which is why we’ll screw her first. Meg and her little posse are dead the second we’re done with them.
6,10,DEAN,"Yeah, if they don’t kill us."
6,10,SAM,They won’t. ’Cause we’re bringing insurance.
6,10,CASTIEL,"I’m here, Sam. Where is the box?"
6,10,SAM,"I can’t believe you fell for that. That was the plot of Raiders, idiot."
6,10,CASTIEL,"I’m mid-battle, Sam."
6,10,SAM,I could give a rat’s ass about your little pissing match with Raphael.
6,10,CASTIEL,"Listen to me, Sam –"
6,10,SAM,"No, you listen! I don’t care what you’re dealing with up in Heaven. You owe me."
6,10,CASTIEL,"You may not care, but believe me –"
6,10,SAM,"I’m sorry, do you think we’re here to talk this out?"
6,10,CASTIEL,"Sam, I can’t just –"
6,10,SAM,"If you don’t help us, I will hunt you down and kill you."
6,10,CASTIEL,"Will you, boy? How?"
6,10,SAM,"I don’t know yet. But I will look until I find out, and I don’t sleep."
6,10,CASTIEL,"You need help, Sam."
6,10,SAM,I need your help.
6,10,DEAN,"You actually showed. Wow, Sam, I owe you a chicken dinner. What happened?"
6,10,SAM,No big. This is what friends do for each other.
6,10,CASTIEL,It’s not working. Crowley’s hidden from me.
6,10,DEAN,"Well, looks like we’re gonna have to try this the hard way."
6,10,SAMUEL,Can I help you? What do you want?
6,10,DEAN,We wanna know where Crowley is.
6,10,SAMUEL,"If I even knew, why would I tell you?"
6,10,DEAN,’Cause you’re our grandfather.
6,10,SAM,"Samuel, I’m gonna get my soul back."
6,10,SAMUEL,Who says you can get it back?
6,10,SAM,Me.
6,10,SAMUEL,"Look, I’d like to help, but I’m sorry."
6,10,DEAN,It’s your grandson’s soul.
6,10,SAMUEL,I can’t.
6,10,DEAN,Mom?
6,10,SAMUEL,He’s gonna give her back to me.
6,10,DEAN,Crowley’s gonna bring mom back from the dead?
6,10,SAMUEL,You tell me you don’t want her back.
6,10,DEAN,"Look, I know how you feel."
6,10,SAMUEL,"No, you don’t. She’s my daughter, and she’s dead, and I can do something about it."
6,10,DEAN,Do you really think Crowley is gonna make good here?
6,10,SAMUEL,He brought Sam back! And me!
6,10,DEAN,"Trust me, don’t go down that road."
6,10,SAMUEL,What are you saying?
6,10,DEAN,"I’m saying, stop trying. It’s gonna go nowhere good. Samuel, I know we’ve had our differences, but I’m your grandson and I’m telling you that this is wrong for so many reasons."
6,10,SAMUEL,You hypocrite!
6,10,DEAN,"I’m asking you to learn from our mistakes! Doing this, this is how the bad guy gets us every time. It’s our Achilles' heel. Apparently it runs in the family. We will figure something else out. Okay?"
6,10,SAMUEL,"I’m sorry Dean, but I –"
6,10,DEAN,Fine. Bring her back. But what are you gonna tell her? You gonna tell her you made a deal with a demon? That you wouldn’t help out her sons?
6,10,SAMUEL,That’s enough! Just get out.
6,10,CASTIEL,It’s very complex.
6,10,DEAN,Mm-hmm.
6,10,CASTIEL,"If the pizza man truly loves this babysitter, why does he keep slapping her rear? Perhaps she’s done something wrong."
6,10,DEAN,You’re watching porn? Why?
6,10,CASTIEL,It was there.
6,10,SAMUEL,"This what you boys do, sit around watching pornos with angels?"
6,10,CASTIEL,We’re not supposed to talk about it.
6,10,DEAN,"Why are you here, Samuel?"
6,10,DEAN,"Well, thanks."
6,10,SAMUEL,I wish you wouldn’t do this.
6,10,SAM,Come with us.
6,10,SAMUEL,"I may be soft, but I’m not suicidal."
6,10,CASTIEL,Why are we working with these abominations?
6,10,MEG,Keep talking dirty. Makes my meatsuit all dewy.
6,10,DEAN,"Alright, simmer down. We know where Crowley is."
6,10,MEG,Great. Do tell.
6,10,SAM,"Yeah, tell you, so you can just leave us for dead."
6,10,MEG,"You boys have serious abandonment issues, you know that?"
6,10,SAM,"We’ll show you, alright? But we’re all going together."
6,10,MEG,"What, I’m just supposed to trust you?"
6,10,SAM,"No, you’re not that stupid. Give me the knife for a minute."
6,10,MEG,"No, I’m not that stupid."
6,10,SAM,Do you want us to take you to Crowley or not?
6,10,SAM,You saw him. He was more interested in killing us than getting the job done. I just did all of us a favor.
6,10,MEG,Hey! You just gonna keep that?
6,10,SAM,You took this from us. I’m taking it back. We leave in one hour.
6,10,DEAN,"You know, Cas, you could help."
6,10,CASTIEL,I’m ambivalent about what we’re attempting.
6,10,DEAN,"Well, breaking into monster Gitmo is not exactly a two-for-one in the champagne room."
6,10,CASTIEL,I’m not sure retrieving Sam’s soul is wise.
6,10,DEAN,"Wait, what? Why?"
6,10,CASTIEL,I want him to survive.
6,10,DEAN,What are you talking about?
6,10,CASTIEL,"Sam’s soul has been locked in the cage with Michael and Lucifer for more than a year. And they have nothing to do but take their frustrations out on him. You understand? If we try to force that mutilated thing down Sam’s gullet, we have no idea what will happen. It could be catastrophic."
6,10,DEAN,You mean he dies.
6,10,CASTIEL,"I mean, he doesn’t. Paralysis. Insanity. Psychic pain so profound that he’s locked inside himself for the rest of his life."
6,10,DEAN,"But you’re saying you don’t know anything for sure. I mean, he could be fine."
6,10,CASTIEL,"He could be, yes."
6,10,DEAN,Okay then.
6,10,CASTIEL,But I sincerely doubt it.
6,10,DEAN,"Well, if he’s not fine, then you fix him."
6,10,CASTIEL,"Dean, I wouldn’t know where to begin."
6,10,DEAN,"Then you figure it out, Cas. Come on. I mean, the guy’s a frigging replicant. He needs his soul. Look, we get it back. And if there are complications, then we will figure out a way to deal with those, too."
6,10,DEAN,Seems pretty quiet.
6,10,CASTIEL,"It’s not, I can feel it. Meet me at the side door."
6,10,DEAN,This all seem a little too easy for you?
6,10,SAM,Way too easy.
6,10,SAM,"Come on, Dean. We gotta move."
6,10,CASTIEL,Wait.
6,10,DEAN,What is it?
6,10,MEG,Damn it. Here come the guards.
6,10,DEAN,Hellhounds. Go!
6,10,DEAN,I knew this was a trap.
6,10,MEG,"What do you want, a cupcake?"
6,10,SAM,"Alright, that should keep them out."
6,10,DEAN,Not for long. How many of them are there?
6,10,MEG,Lots. I’ll be pulling for you … from Cleveland.
6,10,DEAN,What?!
6,10,CASTIEL,"A spell, I think, from Crowley. Within these walls you’re locked inside your body."
6,10,DEAN,"Karma’s a bitch, bitch."
6,10,DEAN,"What are you doing, gonna slash at thin air until you hit something?"
6,10,MEG,At Crowley. Take it and go. You kill the smarmy dick. I’ll hold off the dogs.
6,10,DEAN,How you gonna do that?
6,10,MEG,What was that?
6,10,CASTIEL,I learned that from the pizza man.
6,10,MEG,"Well, A plus for you. I feel so … clean. Okay, gotta go."
6,10,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, is that gonna work on a hellhound?"
6,10,MEG,"Well, we’re about to find out. Run."
6,10,DEAN,Can’t see jack.
6,10,DEAN,Cas?!
6,10,CROWLEY,"Yes. And I have to say, best purchase I’ve made since Dick Cheney."
6,10,DEAN,"Hiya, Crowley. How’s tricks?"
6,10,CROWLEY,"Above your pay grade. Been working. Big things. Alas, you’ll be too dead to participate."
6,10,DEAN,Really?
6,10,CROWLEY,Shame I have to do away with you both. Rather enjoyed your indentured servitude.
6,10,DEAN,Sam?!
6,10,SAM,Yeah.
6,10,DEAN,I’m standing in pee.
6,10,SAM,Consider yourself lucky.
6,10,DEAN,Yikes. That sucks.
6,10,DEAN,"You want forgiveness, find a priest."
6,10,SAMUEL,I just want you to understand.
6,10,DEAN,"Oh, I understand… that you’re a liar. You talk about putting blood first, which is funny ’cause you sound just like my dad. The difference is, he actually did."
6,10,SAMUEL,I am putting blood first.
6,10,DEAN,"Oh, gimme a break!"
6,10,SAMUEL,"Mary’s my blood! My daughter! Don’t come at me like I sold you out, Dean. You sold out your own mother. It was her or Sam, and you chose Sam, plain and simple."
6,10,DEAN,"Oh, that is such crap! You wanna know what really happened? You chose a demon over your own grandsons!"
6,10,DEAN,"I’ll tell you who I am. I’m the guy you never wanna see again. ’Cause I’ll make it out of here, trust me. And the next time you see me, I’ll be there to kill you."
6,10,SAMUEL,Don’t think there’s gonna be a next time.
6,10,DEAN,Whatever gets you through the night.
6,10,Christian!DEMON,"So, Crowley wants to know… well, everything. Told me to carve out of you."
6,10,MEG,Whatever makes you feel like a man.
6,10,DEMON,Ha ha. You talk a mean game. But you’re scared.
6,10,DEMON,Enjoy.
6,10,DEAN,"Alright, alright. Shawshank’s a great flick, but let’s skip the shower scene, huh?"
6,10,DEMON,"Oh, you’ll find out. You’re about to join him."
6,10,DEAN,Frickin’ hate ghouls!
6,10,SAM,Dean?!
6,10,DEAN,"Let me go, son of a bitch!"
6,10,SAM,Dean!
6,10,MEG,"You know, you’re sticking that thing in all the wrong places."
6,10,Christian!DEMON,Really? You sure were squealing.
6,10,MEG,"Knock yourself out. It’s a host body. Some girl from Cheboygan, moved to LA to be an actress. It’s probably not even the worst thing that ever happened to her."
6,10,DEMON,What are you laughing at?
6,10,MEG,"Dean Winchester’s behind you, meatsack."
6,10,SAM,We should go.
6,10,CROWLEY,Whore.
6,10,CROWLEY,"What can I do for you, Sam?"
6,10,SAM,You know damn well. I want my soul back.
6,10,MEG,"And here I thought you just grew some balls, Sam."
6,10,SAM,Well?
6,10,CROWLEY,No.
6,10,DEAN,Meg?
6,10,CROWLEY,I can’t.
6,10,SAM,Can’t or won’t?
6,10,CROWLEY,"I said ‘can’t’. I meant ‘can’t’, you mop-headed lumberjack. I was lucky to get this much of you out. Going back in there for the sloppy bits? No way. I’m good, but those two in there? Forget it."
6,10,SAM,How do I know you’re not lying?
6,10,CROWLEY,"You don’t. But it doesn’t change anything. I’m telling you. Sam, why do you want the thing back? Satan’s got one juicy source of entertainment in there. I’d swallow a rag off a bathhouse floor before I took that soul. Unless you want to be a drooling mess."
6,10,MEG,"Sam, I hate to say it, but he’s right."
6,10,SAM,"Yeah, right. I get it. Thanks. He’s all yours."
6,10,DEAN,"Whoa, what are you, crazy? He’s our only hope."
6,10,SAM,"Dean, you heard him. He can’t get it. He’s useless."
6,10,CROWLEY,"That’s better. You don’t know torture, you little insect."
6,10,CASTIEL,Leave them alone.
6,10,CROWLEY,"Castiel, haven’t seen you all season. You the cavalry now?"
6,10,CASTIEL,Put the knife down.
6,10,CROWLEY,"You that bossy in Heaven? Hear you’re losing out to Raphael. The whole affair makes Vietnam look like a roller derby. Hey, what’s in the gift bag?"
6,10,CROWLEY,Not possible.
6,10,CASTIEL,You didn’t hide your bones as well as you should have.
6,10,CASTIEL,Can you restore Sam’s soul or not?
6,10,CROWLEY,If I could help out in any other –
6,10,DEAN,Answer him!
6,10,CROWLEY,I can’t.
6,10,CASTIEL,Why would I want that?
6,10,DEAN,"Thanks, Cas. Hadn’t it been for you –"
6,10,CASTIEL,Crowley was right. It’s not going well for me upstairs.
6,10,DEAN,If there’s anything we can do –
6,10,CASTIEL,There isn’t. I wish circumstances were different. Much of the time I’d rather be here.
6,10,DEAN,"Look, Cas, we know you got a steaming pile on your plate. There’s no need for apologies. We’re your friends."
6,10,CASTIEL,"Listen, Sam, we’ll find another way."
6,10,SAM,"You really wanna help? Prison full of monsters. Can’t just leave ’em, can’t let ’em go."
6,10,DEAN,"He’s right, you know?"
6,10,SAM,About?
6,10,DEAN,About your soul. We’ll figure something else out.
6,10,SAM,"No, we won’t."
6,10,DEAN,"Why, because Crowley said –"
6,10,SAM,You heard what Crowley said. And I heard what Cas said. Putting this thing back in would smash me to bits.
6,10,DEAN,We don’t know that for sure.
6,10,SAM,"You know what? When angels and demons agree on something, call me nuts, I pay attention."
6,10,DEAN,You say this now? After we practically died trying to –
6,10,SAM,"Exactly! We almost got ourselves killed. I mean, how many times do we risk our asses for this? Enough’s enough."
6,10,DEAN,Sam –
6,10,SAM,I don’t think I want it back.
6,10,DEAN,You don’t even know what you’re saying.
6,10,SAM,"No, I’m saying something you don’t like. You obviously care, a lot. But I think maybe I’m better off without it."
6,10,DEAN,You’re wrong. You don’t know how wrong you are.
6,10,DEAN,"Sam, don’t walk away. Sam! Sam!"
6,12,SAM,"Hey, Dean. It's me."
6,12,SAM (voiceover),About a year.
6,12,DEAN (voiceover),You been back practically this whole time?
6,12,SAM (voiceover),You finally had what you wanted.
6,12,SAM (voiceover),You wanted a family.
6,12,LISA,I need you to go.
6,12,LISA (voiceover),You're a hunter.
6,12,STAN,How you doing?
6,12,PENNY,I'm great. This is great.
6,12,STAN,"Penny, it's gonna be okay. You know, a lot more people die in the shower."
6,12,PENNY,Good to know. Thanks.
6,12,STAN,"I didn't think we'd run into any weather, though."
6,12,PENNY,"Look, can we just land? Please?"
6,12,STAN,Couple minutes. All right? We're close. I'm sorry.
6,12,PENNY,What was that?!
6,12,STAN,What?
6,12,PENNY,Something just flew by the window! It was huge!
6,12,STAN,"Probably just a bird, okay?"
6,12,PENNY,"No! No, Stan, that was not a bird."
6,12,STAN,"Well, then, what was it?"
6,12,PENNY,I don't know.
6,12,STAN,"Penny, there's nothing out there. I promise. Hey, just close your eyes, okay? It's okay. Just lean back. Try to relax. Think of someplace nice. Waves on a beach."
6,12,PENNY,Stan?!
6,12,PENNY,"Oh! Oh, my God! No, no, no, no, no, no!"
6,12,DEAN,Well?
6,12,CASTIEL,His soul is in place.
6,12,DEAN,Is he ever gonna wake up?
6,12,CASTIEL,"I'm not a human doctor, Dean."
6,12,DEAN,Could you take a guess?
6,12,CASTIEL,Okay. Probably not.
6,12,DEAN,"Oh, well, don't sugarcoat it."
6,12,CASTIEL,"I'm sorry, Dean, but I warned you not to put that thing back inside him."
6,12,DEAN,"What was I supposed to do? Let T-1000 walk around, hope he doesn't open fire?"
6,12,CASTIEL,"Let me tell you what his soul felt like when I touched it. Like it had been skinned alive, Dean. If you wanted to kill your brother, you should have done it
outright."
6,12,BOBBY,"Like my daddy always said, just 'cause it kills your liver don't mean it ain't medicine."
6,12,BOBBY,Sam still asleep?
6,12,DEAN,Yeah.
6,12,BOBBY,He'll wake up.
6,12,DEAN,Yeah.
6,12,BOBBY,"Dean, he's been through how much?"
6,12,BOBBY,"Somehow, he always bounces back."
6,12,DEAN,He's never been through this.
6,12,DEAN,Job?
6,12,BOBBY,Might be.
6,12,DEAN,Can I help? Send me to the library? Anything?
6,12,BOBBY,Couple goes up in a light plane. Wreckage was just found in the woods.
6,12,DEAN,Couple of Buddy Hollys?
6,12,DEAN,Doesn't really seem like News of the Weird.
6,12,BOBBY,"Pilot was found seventeen miles away, flambéed."
6,12,BOBBY,"Girl's just gone. No body, no nothing."
6,12,DEAN,"Okay, I'm not changing the channel."
6,12,SAM,Dean.
6,12,DEAN,Sam?
6,12,BOBBY,Good to see you.
6,12,SAM,Wait. I saw you—I—I felt Lucifer snap your neck.
6,12,BOBBY,"Well, Cas kind of—"
6,12,SAM,Cas is alive?
6,12,DEAN,"Yeah, Cas—Cas is fine. Sam, are you okay?"
6,12,SAM,"Actually, um...I'm starving."
6,12,DEAN,"So, Sam..."
6,12,SAM,Yeah?
6,12,DEAN,What's the last thing you remember?
6,12,SAM,The field. And then I fell.
6,12,DEAN,Okay. And then?
6,12,SAM,I woke up in the panic room.
6,12,BOBBY,That's it? You really don't remember—
6,12,DEAN,Let's be glad. Who wants to remember all that hell?
6,12,SAM,"Well, how long was I gone?"
6,12,DEAN,About a year and a half.
6,12,SAM,"What? I was downstairs f— I don't remember anything. So, how'd I get back? Was it Cas?"
6,12,DEAN,Not exactly.
6,12,SAM,"Dean, what did you do?"
6,12,DEAN,Me and Death—
6,12,SAM,Death?! The horseman?
6,12,DEAN,I had leverage. It's done.
6,12,SAM,You sure?
6,12,DEAN,It's over. Slate's wiped.
6,12,BOBBY,"Well, isn't this just neat and clean?"
6,12,DEAN,"Yes, it is—for once."
6,12,SAM,Is there anything else I should know?
6,12,DEAN,No. Another beer?
6,12,SAM,"Uh, yeah."
6,12,DEAN,Hey.
6,12,BOBBY,How is he?
6,12,DEAN,"He's, uh...He's good. Really good. Better than I could have hoped."
6,12,BOBBY,Uh-huh.
6,12,DEAN,What? Why the poopface?
6,12,BOBBY,I'm glad he's better. I really am. But... That kid went straight-up Menendez on me not ten days ago. And now it's all just...erased? Sorry. I'm having a bit of a hard time even looking at him.
6,12,DEAN,It wasn't Sam.
6,12,DEAN,"Well, what do you want to do, Bobby? We tell him everything?"
6,12,BOBBY,"No. Just wish I could, that's all."
6,12,DEAN,"Yeah, but if we start throwing that crap at him, we don't know what's gonna happen. It could—it could crack the wall."
6,12,BOBBY,I know. I know.
6,12,DEAN,"So, you know what? As far as I'm concerned, it's a gift horse, and I'm not looking for teeth. I'm sending Death a damn fruit basket."
6,12,BOBBY,"He's gonna find out, you know. One way or another, someone'll tell him, or he'll figure it out on his own. He's not dumb. He should it hear it from us."
6,12,DEAN,"Can we just leave it alone for the moment, please?"
6,12,BOBBY,Sam still asleep?
6,12,DEAN,"Yeah, let him rest. We'll call him later."
6,12,SAM,Call me from where?
6,12,DEAN,"Oh. Uh, there's this thing
in Oregon."
6,12,SAM,Great. I'm in.
6,12,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa. You just got vertical."
6,12,SAM,Exactly. I'm up. I'm good.
6,12,DEAN,"Well, a few more days of crap cable couldn't hurt."
6,12,DEAN,"All right. You, me, and Bobby."
6,12,BOBBY,"Oh, you two go on ahead. You got this covered. I, uh, forgot I promised that idjit Rufus I'd work the phones for him, so..."
6,12,DEAN,You sure?
6,12,BOBBY,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. You two enjoy catching up,
okay?"
6,12,SAM,What was that?
6,12,DEAN,"One part age, three parts liquor."
6,12,SAM,"Uh, you got it, officer. Thank you. You too."
6,12,SAM,"So, get this—besides the crash, there were two other disappearances in town this week."
6,12,DEAN,Really?
6,12,SAM,"Yeah, last weekend, a college girl vanished
from her apartment. On the seventeenth floor. Then, three days ago, another girl didn't make it home from school."
6,12,DEAN,They know each other?
6,12,SAM,"No. No connection. Just young and female, like the plane-crash girl."
6,12,DEAN,"What would disappear a girl out of the sky, anyway?"
6,12,SAM,Good question.
6,12,SAM,"So you never even tried, huh?"
6,12,DEAN,Tried?
6,12,SAM,"To go live a life...after. You do remember you promised that, right?"
6,12,DEAN,"Yeah, I remember."
6,12,SAM,"So, why didn't you try?"
6,12,DEAN,What makes you think I didn't?
6,12,SAM,'Cause look at you. Look at this. You're exactly the same.
6,12,DEAN,"Yeah, you're probably right."
6,12,DEAN,I was with them for a year—Lisa and Ben.
6,12,SAM,A year?
6,12,SAM,So then what?
6,12,DEAN,Didn't work out.
6,12,DEAN,"You're, uh...Penny Dessertine's sister, right?"
6,12,PENNY'S SISTER,Mm-hmm.
6,12,SAM,"Uh, we'd just like to ask you a few questions."
6,12,PENNY'S SISTER,"Look, the cops already came by. I'm tired. So, if you don't mind --"
6,12,SAM,"I—I understand. Really, I do. I know how hard this must be. We'd just like to figure out what happened. This will be quick. I promise."
6,12,PENNY'S SISTER,Okay. Fine. Come in.
6,12,PENNY'S SISTER,Penny was very shy. To herself. Not at all what you'd call adventurous.
6,12,DEAN,"What, like flying through a lightning storm in a two-seater?"
6,12,PENNY'S SISTER,She was terrified of that thing. She just did it for Stan.
6,12,SAM,Stan?
6,12,PENNY'S SISTER,"They were just starting to get serious. She didn't want to seem, you know...Not interested. I just wish I'd told her to stay home. We don't even have a body to bury."
6,12,SAM,Hey.
6,12,DEAN,What do you got?
6,12,SAM,"Uh...Well, looks like those other two missing girls both baked cookies for the lord."
6,12,DEAN,What is that? Code?
6,12,SAM,"No. Church choir, bake sales, promise-ring clubs—the works. They were good girls. But Penny wasn't even a Christian, so—"
6,12,DEAN,I have another theory. Penny's diary.
6,12,SAM,Did you steal that from her room?
6,12,DEAN,I love that you even asked me that.
6,12,SAM,And why wouldn't I?
6,12,DEAN,"No reason. So girl-nappings. What if it's not about religion, what if it's about purity?"
6,12,SAM,You mean you think they're all—
6,12,DEAN,"Virgins, Sam. Virgins."
6,12,SAM,Penny was twenty-two.
6,12,DEAN,"Yeah, with a pink room."
6,12,SAM,So?
6,12,DEAN,And stuffed teddy bears.
6,12,SAM,Fine. But you really think—
6,12,DEAN,"""I've decided I'm going to give Stan my most precious gift."""
6,12,SAM,Wow. That sounded really creepy coming out of your mouth.
6,12,DEAN,I think I delivered it.
6,12,SAM,"You know, you—you could have led with 'the diary'. You know? Anyways, let's say you're right. Fine. Who would want virgins?"
6,12,DEAN,You got me. I prefer ladies with experience.
6,12,MELISSA,Aaaaaaaah!
6,12,MELISSA,It happened so fast.
6,12,SAM,"It's all right, Melissa. What came at you? You can tell us."
6,12,MELISSA,"It—it looked like a...a giant bat. You think I'm making it up, right? That's what the other man said."
6,12,SAM,"Well, I'm not the other man."
6,12,MELISSA,It came right at me. It was huge. I swear. That's how I got this.
6,12,SAM,"So, it attacked. And then what happened?"
6,12,MELISSA,"I don't know. I passed out, and when I woke up, it was gone."
6,12,SAM,"Is there anything else you can think of? Anything you can tell us, even if it doesn't seem
important?"
6,12,MELISSA,"Well, my ring got lost. Or else that thing stole it, if that makes any sense."
6,12,DEAN,What kind of ring?
6,12,MELISSA,Gold. Promise ring.
6,12,MELISSA,Yeah. Why?
6,12,DEAN,"I got to ask. Uh, Melissa... Look, nobody is, uh, judging anybody here, okay? Believe me. But...Should you really be wearing that ring?"
6,12,MELISSA,"Well, I-I mean, I-I am—"
6,12,DEAN,Really?
6,12,MELISSA,Matt Barne didn't count!
6,12,SAM,"So, what, you think Batman tried to rape her?"
6,12,DEAN,"Well, he does carry a lot of rage. But he rejected her because she was already dehymenated, huh?"
6,12,SAM,You think?
6,12,DEAN,I think it just goes to show that being easy's pretty much all upside.
6,12,SAM,"So, what kind of thing likes virgins and gold?"
6,12,DEAN,P. Diddy?
6,12,SAM,"You know, it's comforting."
6,12,DEAN,What's that?
6,12,SAM,"I died for a year, came back, and you're still not funny."
6,12,DEAN,Shut up. I'm hilarious.
6,12,SAM,This can't be possible.
6,12,DEAN,Try me.
6,12,SAM,"Um, I googled ""fire,"" ""claws,"" ""flying,"" ""stealing virgins,"" and ""gold,"" and it all takes me
to the same place."
6,12,DEAN,Where?
6,12,DEAN,I don't know what that means.
6,12,SAM,"Dragons, dude. See? Told you. Not possible."
6,12,DEAN,"Actually, it might be."
6,12,SAM,How? In what reality?
6,12,DEAN,It's been a strange year. We should get a second opinion.
6,12,BOBBY,Yeah?
6,12,DEAN,What do you know about dragons?
6,12,BOBBY,What? Nothing.
6,12,DEAN,Seriously.
6,12,BOBBY,"Well, they're not like the Loch Ness monster, Dean. Dragons aren't real."
6,12,DEAN,Could you make a few calls?
6,12,BOBBY,To who? Hogwarts?
6,12,DEAN,Humor me.
6,12,BOBBY,Fine.
6,12,DEAN,You're a gentleman and a scholar.
6,12,DEAN,Everything's fine. Sam says hey.
6,12,SAM,You okay?
6,12,DEAN,Yeah.
6,12,SAM,Bobby say anything?
6,12,DEAN,Nope.
6,12,SAM,"Hey, did we hunt a skinwalker lately?"
6,12,DEAN,Doesn't ring a bell. Why?
6,12,SAM,I don't know. Just...déjà vu or something. Are you sure? I could have sworn—
6,12,DEAN,"You got to remember, your eggs are still a little scrambled, right? But, yeah, I'm sure."
6,12,SAM,All right. Yeah. Never mind.
6,12,DEAN,"Hey, Bobby. What do you got?"
6,12,BOBBY,"Can't believe she didn't jump right to mind. Dr. Visyak. Medieval Studies, S.F.U."
6,12,DEAN,"Dr. Visyak, S.F.U. Got it. Thanks. All right. I'm going to San Francisco, figure out how to kill these things. You figure out where they are."
6,12,SAM,W-wait. D-did Bobby say where they like to park?
6,12,DEAN,No.
6,12,SAM,Great. Back to the lore.
6,12,DEAN,Which says what? That they live in Middle-Earth?
6,12,SAM,No. Caves.
6,12,DEAN,You're such a nerd.
6,12,GIRL,Please let me go! Please! No! Aah! No!
6,12,DRAGON 1,"Shut up! Shut up, or I'll break the other one. Now, get in there. Come on."
6,12,PENNY,It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
6,12,DR. VISYAK,Yes?
6,12,DEAN,Dr. Visyak. My name is Dean Winchester.
6,12,DR. VISYAK,Office hours are Monday and Friday.
6,12,DEAN,Bobby Singer sent me. Hello? Hi.
6,12,DR. VISYAK,Bobby Singer. Tell him something for me next time you see him.
6,12,DEAN,Hmm?
6,12,DR. VISYAK,"Actually, just kick him in the jewels. That's more poetic."
6,12,DEAN,"No love lost between you two, huh?"
6,12,DR. VISYAK,No. Just the opposite.
6,12,DEAN,Oh?
6,12,DR. VISYAK,"That's his story to tell. He's the idiot. So, what's this about?"
6,12,DEAN,"Well, uh...Dragons."
6,12,DR. VISYAK,Really?
6,12,DEAN,"What, no twelve-sided-dice joke?"
6,12,DR. VISYAK,We can joke about them because they've disappeared. But they aren't funny.At all.
6,12,DEAN,"Well, one just flew in stateside."
6,12,DR. VISYAK,Are you sure?
6,12,DEAN,Fits the lore to a tee.
6,12,DR. VISYAK,"But how? I mean, why? It's been seven hundred years."
6,12,DEAN,"Banner crop of crazy all the way around these days, doc."
6,12,DR. VISYAK,So you want to know how to kill it.
6,12,DEAN,That's right.
6,12,DR. VISYAK,"Well, you need a blade."
6,12,DEAN,Uh... Okay. What kind of blade?
6,12,DR. VISYAK,One forged with dragon's blood.
6,12,DEAN,"So you need one to kill one, but you got to kill one to make one. How does that work out?"
6,12,DR. VISYAK,"Well, there aren't many dragon swords around anymore. Five or six, tops, worldwide.
I mean, there's the sword of St. George, and, of course, there's Excalibur. And there's—"
6,12,DEAN,"You know a lot about this stuff, don't you?"
6,12,DR. VISYAK,"Well, I sure as hell better. I have one in the basement."
6,12,DEAN,You have one.
6,12,DR. VISYAK,"Finding it took two decades, countless hours, and some really bad sex with an eastern European ambassador, but, yeah."
6,12,DEAN,That is not real. Is that real? Is it Excalibur?
6,12,DR. VISYAK,No. This...Is the Sword of Brunswick. Love of my life.
6,12,DEAN,"So, uh, what's with the cement shoe?"
6,12,DR. VISYAK,"You know, binding sword to stone used to be all the rage. To protect them."
6,12,DEAN,"All right, well, how do we get this puppy out?"
6,12,DR. VISYAK,"Well, come on. You know this one. We need a brave knight who's willing to step up and kill the beast."
6,12,DEAN,"Right. All right, well, I'll, uh, give it a whirl. Do you mind?"
6,12,DR. VISYAK,Oh.
6,12,DR. VISYAK,You okay?
6,12,DEAN,Never better.
6,12,DEAN,"Oh, son of a bitch! That's really on there!"
6,12,DR. VISYAK,"Yeah, afraid so."
6,12,DEAN,"Well, I have another idea."
6,12,DR. VISYAK,What?
6,12,DEAN,"Well, you're not gonna like it."
6,12,BOBBY,Sam. Where's Dean?
6,12,SAM,"Hey, um...He went to go see your friend. So, look, I'm trying to figure out where this thing lairs up. Uh, little help, maybe?"
6,12,BOBBY,What are the parameters?
6,12,SAM,"Caves, basically. But there's nothing around for miles."
6,12,BOBBY,"So, less literal, then. What else you got local that's cold, dark, and wet?"
6,12,SAM,"Huh. Well, um...There's no subway lines. Sewers. That could be it. Thanks."
6,12,BOBBY,All right.
6,12,SAM,"Wait, Bobby. Wait. Um...You okay?"
6,12,BOBBY,"Yeah, of course. Why? What's wrong?"
6,12,SAM,Besides the way you been acting and talking? Nothing. Is there something I should know?
6,12,BOBBY,No. All you need to know is where Godzilla's holed up.
6,12,SAM,"Well, Bobby, what happened this last year?"
6,12,BOBBY,"It had its moments. No more than usual. It's got nothing to do with you, Sam. How could it?"
6,12,SAM,Right. 'Course.
6,12,BOBBY,Call me if you need anything.
6,12,SAM,"Castiel, um...I'm back. So, if you got a minute..."
6,12,CASTIEL,Sam. It's so good to see you alive.
6,12,SAM,Yeah. You too.
6,12,CASTIEL,—that would be awkward.
6,12,SAM,"Um...Was a crazy year, huh? I-I-I just talked to Bobby. He—he told me everything that happened."
6,12,CASTIEL,"Frankly, I'm surprised that you survived. I was begging Dean not to do it."
6,12,SAM,"Yeah. No, I-I-I can understand that."
6,12,CASTIEL,"You know, it's a miracle it didn't kill you."
6,12,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, it's a miracle, all right."
6,12,CASTIEL,"So, how does it feel?"
6,12,SAM,What?
6,12,CASTIEL,"Well, to have your soul back, of course."
6,12,SAM,"Right. Y-you mean 'cause I was walking around with no soul. Uh... Really good, Cas.
I'm real good. You know what? I'm—I'm just hazy on a few of the details, though. Um...
You think maybe you could...walk me through?"
6,12,DR. VISYAK,You know what? I-I-I don't like this at all. You do realize that this is the single most valuable artifact you have ever touched.
6,12,DEAN,"It's also the only weapon we got. Look, I know what I'm doing, okay? I actually learned it all from Bobby. Hey, whatever happened there, you know he's at least a genius at this.
Do you want me to kill that dragon or not?"
6,12,DR. VISYAK,Okay.
6,12,DEAN,Trust me.
6,12,DEAN,"You rocks think you're so smart. All right. Welcome to the 21st century. All right, stand back."
6,12,DEAN,Okay. Now...
6,12,DEAN,"You've got insurance for this, right?"
6,12,SAM,"And what are we supposed to do with this, Dean? Give it a booster shot?"
6,12,DEAN,It's what we got. All right? We're just gonna have to get a little closer. That's all. Where are we on the caves?
6,12,SAM,"Nowhere. Sewers, on the other hand...Here. Check this out."
6,12,SAM,"So, two of the disappearances happened within a mile of here. So I think we start there and work our way around."
6,12,DEAN,Awesome. Who doesn't love sewers? Let's go.
6,12,DEAN,What?
6,12,SAM,"Nothing. Uh, yeah, let's go."
6,12,DEAN,"Ugh! God. Just when I get used to a smell, I hit a new flavor. Dude, we have been here
for hours. There is nothing. I think the lore is off. Hey, what if, uh...What if dragons like
nice hotels?"
6,12,SAM,What is that?
6,12,DEAN,What?
6,12,DEAN,Holy crap.
6,12,DEAN,"Okay, maybe there are dragons here."
6,12,SAM,Wait. Dean...Not now. Check this out.
6,12,SAM,"A little arts-and-crafty for a giant bat, right?"
6,12,PENNY,Hello? Is someone there? Hello?
6,12,DEAN,Hey. We're gonna get you out.
6,12,PENNY,Quick. He's coming back.
6,12,DRAGON,Where do you think you're gonna stick that?
6,12,DRAGON,Aah! Where did you get that?
6,12,DEAN,Comic-Con.
6,12,DRAGON,Aah!
6,12,DEAN,"Hey, Sam. Ask me what time it is."
6,12,SAM,Why don't you cut to the chase and just roll in it?
6,12,DEAN,I rarely have wealth.
6,12,SAM,Dean...
6,12,DEAN,Yeah?
6,12,SAM,I am so...so sorry. I can't even begin to say.
6,12,DEAN,For what?
6,12,SAM,You know what.
6,12,DEAN,Did Bobby...
6,12,SAM,Cas.
6,12,DEAN,Cas. Friggin' child.
6,12,SAM,"You should have told me, Dean."
6,12,DEAN,You weren't supposed to know.
6,12,SAM,What I did? To Bobby? To you? Of course I should know.
6,12,DEAN,"Sam, Death didn't just shove your soul back in, okay? He put up the great wall of Sam between you and the things that you don't remember. And trust me when I say that the things you don't know could kill you. That's not a joke."
6,12,SAM,"All right. But I have to set things right. Or what I can, anyway."
6,12,DEAN,It wasn't you.
6,12,SAM,"You know, I kind of feel like I got slipped the worst mickey of all time...and I woke up to find out that I had burnt the whole city down. And you can say it wasn't me, but...I'm the one with the zippo in my pocket, you know? So I'm not sure it's that cut and dry. And, look, I a-appreciate you trying to protect me. I really do. But I got to fix... What I got to fix. So I need to know what I did."
6,12,DEAN,But you don't know how dangerous that could be.
6,12,SAM,What would you do? Right. Same thing.
6,12,DEAN,Sam...
6,12,BOBBY,"Boys, something I think you ought to see."
6,12,BOBBY,"Now, as near as I can figure it, this dates back around the fourteenth century."
6,12,SAM,What language is it?
6,12,BOBBY,"Da Vinci code. Real obscure Latinate. Gonna take me my golden years to translate it all.
Oh, and, uh, FYI—that ain't paper."
6,12,DEAN,What is it?
6,12,BOBBY,It's human skin. Okay. I'm fairly clear on this first bit. It basically describes this place. It's like the backside of your worst nightmares. It's all blood and bone and darkness.
6,12,BOBBY,"Filled with the bodies and souls of all things hungry, sharp, and nasty."
6,12,DRAGON 2,Where are they?
6,12,DRAGON 1,I ran into trouble.
6,12,DRAGON 2,You're damn lucky I got enough.
6,12,DRAGON 1,"This is your lucky day, little girl. Come on, come on."
6,12,SAM,Monsters?
6,12,BOBBY,"It's monsterland. According to this, it goes by many names, most of which I can't pronounce, but I'm thinking you know Purgatory."
6,12,DEAN,"Purgatory? Awesome. Well, that is good to know. So, you're saying that these, uh, dragon freaks were squatting in the sewers and reading tone poems about purgatory?"
6,12,BOBBY,"Oh, no, no, no. They're reading an instruction manual."
6,12,DEAN,What?
6,12,BOBBY,"Yeah. If you're nuts enough to want access to a place that gnarly, this book will show you how to open a door."
6,12,DEAN,"Door to purgatory. Well, I know a demon who would have loved to have known about that. So, how do you open the door?"
6,12,BOBBY,Ask Cloverfield. I'm pretty sure he's got that page.
6,12,DRAGON 1,"Ego coniuro vos, insolubiliter ad mei potenciam aligati! Ad me...Sine prestolacione venire..."
6,12,GIRL,Let me go! Please stop!
6,12,DRAGON 1,...Debeatis aperiat!
6,12,GIRL,No! Please don't!
6,12,DRAGON,Huc sine mora debeas mater!
6,12,BOBBY,It gets worse.
6,12,SAM,Worse?
6,12,BOBBY,This ain't talking about how to take a vacation over there. This is all about opening a door to let something in.
6,12,SAM,Bring something here. What?
6,12,BOBBY,I'm working on it.
6,12,DEAN,Could you give us something?
6,12,BOBBY,I got a name.
6,12,DEAN,Okay.
6,12,BOBBY,Mother.
6,12,SAM,Mother? M-mother of what? Mother of dragons?
6,12,BOBBY,I wish. It says it a few times here. Mother of all.
6,12,DRAGON 1,Welcome.
6,12,DEAN,"What the hell does ""mother of all"" mean?"
6,12,BOBBY,I don't know.
6,13,SAMUEL,You okay?
6,13,SAM,Yeah.
6,13,SAMUEL,How's the arm?
6,13,SAM,It'll hold till we get out of town.
6,13,SAMUEL,"Just don't bleed out, all right?"
6,13,SAM,"Yeah, well, that's the plan."
6,13,SAMUEL,Cop.
6,13,SAMUEL,"Evening, Deputy."
6,13,DEPUTY ATKINS,"Agent Roark, Agent Wynand, mind stepping out of the van a moment?"
6,13,SAMUEL,We're just on our way to the office. Everything okay?
6,13,DEPUTY ATKINS,No. I can't get Sheriff Dobbs on the phone. I can't get anyone!
6,13,SAMUEL,"We spoke to Dobbs earlier. Maybe he's just, uh—"
6,13,DEPUTY ATKINS,(noticing Sam's bloody sleeve) is that blood?
6,13,SAMUEL,"Hey, look, there's no need to get riled."
6,13,DEPUTY ATKINS,You're coming with me.
6,13,SAMUEL,All right. We'll follow you back.
6,13,DEPUTY ATKINS,"I don't think so. Get in my car, or you're under arrest."
6,13,SAM,You're gonna arrest two federal agents? Really? (laughs) Have a good night. (Sam turns away)
6,13,DEPUTY ATKINS,If you think—
6,13,SAMUEL,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, just hold—"
6,13,SAMUEL,You think there were maybe calmer ways we could have done all that?
6,13,SAM,Do we care? Let's go.
6,13,DEAN,What are you watching?
6,13,SAM,"Just trying to catch up. So...Mel Gibson really took a turn this past year, huh?"
6,13,DEAN,"Or he's possessed. Seriously, think about it. So, I just got off the blower with Bobby."
6,13,SAM,"Oh, yeah? You got anything else on this, uh, 'Mother of All' thing?"
6,13,DEAN,"Uh, no, nothing solid. He says it's quiet."
6,13,SAM,Quiet like quiet or quiet like too quiet?
6,13,DEAN,When is it ever just quiet?
6,13,SAM,Right. (Sam checks his cell phone and sees he has received a text message of coordinates) Hmm.
6,13,DEAN,"What? What are these, coordinates? Who's it from?"
6,13,SAM,"I have no idea.
(Sam looks the coordinates up on a map)"
6,13,DEAN,Well?
6,13,SAM,"Uh, Bristol, Rhode Island, where three women disappeared in the last week. Apparently, the, uh, victims seemed to vanish into thin air."
6,13,DEAN,Could be something. Who's the text from?
6,13,SAM,I don't know. It just kept ringing.
6,13,DEAN,What's that about?
6,13,SAM,"Could be another hunter looking for backup, throwing us a case? Who knows how many hunters I even met, working with the Campbells, you know? But I think we should go."
6,13,DEAN,"Whoa, wait. We're just gonna drop everything?"
6,13,SAM,"Dude, two minutes ago, you weren't doing anything."
6,13,DEAN,"You got mysterious coordinates from a mysterious Mr. ""X,"" leading to a mysterious town? That doesn't throw up red flags to you?"
6,13,SAM,I don't know. Maybe. But that doesn't mean we can just ignore a bunch of missing girls. Right?
6,13,DEAN,"Okay. We'll check it out. But if things get squirrelly, we dump out, okay?"
6,13,SAM,Yeah.
6,13,DEAN,What?
6,13,SAM,Nothing.
6,13,DEAN,"(looking through missing persons leaflets) Well, freak's got a type—brunettes. Whoa. This one's got a little bit of a wild side. It's all in the eyes, Sam. See it?"
6,13,SAM,"All right, well, aside from your little deep insight there, these women actually have nothing in common—different jobs, different friends, different everything. So, what's the connection?"
6,13,DEAN,"I don't know. Why don't you figure that out? I'm gonna go hit the poop deck. (Dean heads to the bathroom, marked with the sign 'poop deck')"
6,13,WOMAN,(approaches Sam)Agent Roark? It's good to see you again.
6,13,SAM,It is.
6,13,WOMAN,"Oh, you remember my husband? (gestures to her husband)"
6,13,SAM,Right.
6,13,WOMAN,Don.
6,13,SAM,"Of course, right. Um, hi."
6,13,WOMAN,"So, you're back 'cause it started again, right—the disappearances?"
6,13,SAM,"Uh, yeah. Yeah, right. Um...So, if either of you two hear anything, please let me know."
6,13,WOMAN,"Where's your partner? The big bald guy? Agent Wynand, right?"
6,13,SAM,"Agent Wynand, of course. Well—"
6,13,DEAN,"Sex rehab. Yeah, you've heard of plushies, right?"
6,13,DEAN,"Hi. Pleasure.(shakes woman's hand) How you doing? Hi.(shakes Don's hand) Uh, so, Agent, we should, uh—"
6,13,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, of course."
6,13,WOMAN,"Of course. Uh, nice chatting with you, Agent Roark."
6,13,SAM,You too.
6,13,WOMAN,(in Sam's memory) Cuff me.
6,13,DEAN,What was that? She just cougar-eyed you.
6,13,SAM,I think Samuel and I have worked a case in this town.
6,13,DEAN,"You think? (Dean shows Sam a polaroid he got from the wall of customers who won the restaurant's eating challenge, which shows Sam and Samuel in the background, behind a winner) Come on. Let's get the hell out of here."
6,13,DEAN,"Hey, come on. Hop to, would you?"
6,13,SAM,"We can't go, Dean."
6,13,DEAN,"Uh, yeah, we can."
6,13,SAM,"No, listen—five guys went missing a year ago. They never found the bodies. I mean, that's got to be the job me and Samuel worked, right?"
6,13,DEAN,Great. What difference does it make?
6,13,SAM,"A year ago, five guys go missing, and—and now suddenly all these women go missing. Something's here. So either we just didn't stop it, or we only thought we did."
6,13,DEAN,"Okay, but why the gender bend, huh? First it's dudes. Now it's chicks? That's a totally different M.O."
6,13,SAM,"I don't know. Who knows? The point is, something's still here."
6,13,DEAN,Great. We'll call Bobby. He can deal with it.
6,13,SAM,Why? We can deal with it.
6,13,DEAN,"Are you serious? Sam, there is a reason that hunters don't hit the same town over again—'cause we have a habit of leaving messes behind."
6,13,SAM,Right. I agree.
6,13,DEAN,One of dad's rules -- you never use the same crapper twice.
6,13,SAM,Everyone uses the same crapper twice.
6,13,DEAN,Not us. You know what I mean.
6,13,SAM,"Okay, look—this creature is still walking around 'cause of me, right? I mean, I let it go. Dad also said, ""you finish what you start."" Okay, I get it."
6,13,DEAN,Do you?
6,13,SAM,"Yes. You're afraid I'll stroll down memory lane and I'll kick this wall in my head so hard, Hell comes flooding through, right? And then all of a sudden, I'm some drooling mess on the floor."
6,13,DEAN,It's not a joke.
6,13,SAM,"Okay. I know. But listen—what's happening here right now—it's because I messed up somehow, in some big way. So every person who gets taken, every person who dies—that's on me. I have to stop it. And you'd do the same thing."
6,13,DEAN,All right. I'll follow up with the brunettes. You see what you get from the cops.
6,17,ELLEN,"I think these are John Winchester's boys. Hey, I'm Ellen. That's my daughter Jo."
6,17,DEAN,Ow.
6,17,ELLEN,"The can of whoop-ass I ought to open on you. You better put me on speed dial, kid."
6,17,DEAN,"Yes, ma'am."
6,17,JO,"Those are hellhounds out there, Dean. We let the dogs in, you guys hit the roof, make a break for the building next over. I can wait here with my finger on the button. If I can get us a shot on the devil, we have to take it."
6,17,ELLEN,I will not leave you here alone.
6,17,CASTIEL,"It's Civil War up there. If we can beat Raphael, we can end this."
6,17,BALTHAZAR,"You did more than rebel, you tore up the whole script and burned the pages for all of us. Do you have any idea what souls are worth, what power they hold?"
6,17,AGENT ADAMS,Have you seen this man? Rufus Turner.
6,17,BOBBY,"No, never seen that dick."
6,17,BOBBY,I ain't asking for no help.
6,17,RUFUS,I'm not asking for your permission.
6,17,RUFUS,Just like old times.
6,17,BOBBY,Long as I get to drive. (Rufus laughs)
6,17,SAM,What are you?
6,17,SAM,Bobby!
6,17,BOBBY,"It's my fault. (Bobby takes a sip of Rufus' favourite drink, Johnny Walker Blue)"
6,17,MAN,Piece of crap.
6,17,MAN,"Oh, damn it."
6,17,SAM,(whispers) Say something.
6,17,DEAN,(whispers) No. You.
6,17,SAM,(whispers) No. You.
6,17,SAM,(clears throat) Uh...
6,17,BOBBY,"You two just gonna stand there like the ugly girl at the prom, or you gonna pitch in? This so-called Eve, mother of whatever, ain't gonna gank herself. What's wrong with you two?"
6,17,DEAN,"Bobby, you haven't slept in days."
6,17,BOBBY,"I sleep. What are you, my wife now?"
6,17,DEAN,"I'm just saying that, you know, taking five might be a good thing."
6,17,BOBBY,For whom?
6,17,SAM,"Look, Bobby, it was – it was tough for all of us, seeing Rufus go like that."
6,17,BOBBY,You think this—? This ain't about Rufus.
6,17,DEAN,"Bobby, he wasn't just a poker buddy."
6,17,BOBBY,"You know when I knew Rufus was done for? The day I met him. The only question was, who first – him or me? Now, you want to stand there and therapise, or you want to get me some coffee? (Sam & Dean exchange a look) Make it Irish."
6,17,DEAN,"Well, he's doing fantastic."
6,17,SAM,"Yeah, this isn't about Rufus at all."
6,17,DEAN,"Well, what do you want to do? I mean, we can't just sit here and watch him poop out his liver."
6,17,SAM,"Well, we could get him out of the house. There's a job."
6,17,DEAN,Really? What've you got?
6,17,SAM,"(pulls a newspaper clipping out of his jacket pocket) Look. Chester, Pennsylvania. Three people got kicked off in the last week, all freaky. Last guy got karate-chopped by his garage door. And these are all blood relatives."
6,17,DEAN,"What are you thinking, family curse?"
6,17,SAM,Could be.
6,17,DEAN,"Hey, grumpy – (Dean yells to Bobby, who has walked up behind them) You, uh—?"
6,17,BOBBY,"I don't want to do crap. Leave me alone. Just, get out of my house, both of you. You're driving me nuts."
6,17,DEAN,Bobby.
6,17,BOBBY,Now! For the love of Pete.
6,17,SAM,"You know, maybe we should wait 'til she gets back."
6,17,DEAN,"Dude, she just called from the road, said she'd be here in two shakes. You really want to sit around and smell him stew in his juices?"
6,17,SAM,"Yeah, yeah. Drive."
6,17,BOBBY,What the...?
6,17,ELLEN,Tell me you haven't been drinking this whole time.
6,17,BOBBY,You're worse than the boys. I'm working.
6,17,ELLEN,"My God. I'm gone a week, and this place goes completely to hell. What is wrong with you, Bobby Singer?"
6,17,BOBBY,Get a pen. It's a long list.
6,17,ELLEN,"You smell like a bar, you know that?"
6,17,BOBBY,You don't exactly smell like a rose yourself.
6,17,ELLEN,"Huh. Yeah, I've been hunting with Jo. What's your excuse?"
6,17,BOBBY,"If I need one, I got a good one."
6,17,ELLEN,"I know. And I'm so sorry. He meant a lot to me, too. Go wash up. I'll fix us something. (She pats Bobby on the arm.)"
6,17,BOBBY,Anybody ever tell you you're a pain in the ass?
6,17,ELLEN,(laughs and kisses Bobby on the cheek) That's why you married me. (Ellen pushes Bobby gently) Go.
6,17,BOBBY,"Don't tell me what to do, Ellen."
6,17,DEAN,(turns on the EMF meter) Not a bleep.
6,17,SAM,"Well, not a vengeful spirit, then. So what is it? (Sam finds a golden thread on the floor.) Huh."
6,17,DEAN,"Whatcha got? What is that, Christmas tinsel?"
6,17,SAM,"I don't know. (Sam rubs the thread against a flower pot, it leaves a gold streak.) It's gold."
6,17,DEAN,"You mean, like, gold gold?"
6,17,SAM,Why would a handyman have gold just lying around in his garage?
6,17,DEAN,"I don't know. There is definitely a skeleton in this family's closet. I mean, accidents don't just happen accidentally. (Sam gives Dean a look.) You know what I mean."
6,17,SAM,"All right. How about I'll go check family records, you go with next of kin?"
6,17,DEAN,Yeah.
6,17,DEAN,"Genealogy. From the university. W-w-we're doing a study on local families, and, well, the Russos are -"
6,17,RUSSO,"Yeah, well, you know what? I got to tell you, I am extremely busy right now, so -"
6,17,DEAN,"Yeah, I-I'm sure you've had a rough week. I, uh, read about the recent tragedies. Your cousins, right?"
6,17,RUSSO,"Yeah. It's a shame. But I'm not that close with my family, so, uh (sighs) is this gonna take long?"
6,17,DEAN,"No. Five minutes. Five minutes. Uh, can you – can you tell me anything, uh, noteworthy about the Russos?"
6,17,RUSSO,"Noteworthy? No. I mean, not exactly – average, you know, big, from Italy."
6,17,DEAN,"I see. Uh, was anyone ever killed or maimed in a war or, you know, some other violent thing?"
6,17,RUSSO,(scoffs) What do you mean?
6,17,DEAN,Like something so dark that it would sully future generations.
6,17,RUSSO,Uh... No.
6,17,DEAN,Good. Good stuff. Anyone own a slave?
6,17,RUSSO,What?
6,17,DEAN,Routine question. Any ties to the Nazi Party?
6,17,RUSSO,Excuse me?
6,17,DEAN,Did grandma ever piss off a gypsy?
6,17,RUSSO,"Okay, you know what? (Russo stands up.) I don't know what kind of study you're doing, but it's over. Right now. So if you don't mind -"
6,17,DEAN,"Okay, I-I'll just cut to the chase here. (Dean stands.) Um, your life is in danger."
6,17,RUSSO,"What? What is that, a threat? Are you threatening me?!"
6,17,DEAN,"No, no, no. No, no. I'm not threatening you. I'm just simply saying that if you don't watch your back, you're gonna die."
6,17,RUSSO,Get the hell out of my office.
6,17,DEAN,Okay.
6,17,RUSSO,Now!
6,17,SAM,(on the phone) Hey.
6,17,DEAN,(on the phone) Sam.
6,17,SAM,Find anything?
6,17,DEAN,"Uh, one asshat in a shiny suit. You?"
6,17,SAM,Not much. Great grandparents born in Calabria. Emigrated 1912. Been here ever since.
6,17,DEAN,"What, no severed horse head?"
6,17,SAM,Ha. Four generations of picket fence.
6,17,DEAN,"If these people are the Waltons, then why the hell are they dying?"
6,17,WOMAN,"(on the phone) Well, how about Cuba? It's beautiful this time of year. And the new Trump Casino – amazing. Don't worry about the kids. There's a wave pool. Oh! Sure, yeah! (She writes something and drinks from a cup.)"
6,17,WOMAN,"Look, if you like cigars, Cher, or the circus, it's all about Havana. Yes, I've seen the Shatner ads. But you know what they don't have? Personal touch. Okay, then. I'll e-mail you some details. You too."
6,17,WOMAN,(gasps & chokes)
6,17,DEAN,"Anne Witting. You sure she's not a Russo, a second cousin twice removed or something?"
6,17,SAM,"No, I checked the records twice. She's not related."
6,17,DEAN,"Well, if this isn't a family curse, then what the hell is it?"
6,17,SAM,You got me. I got nothing. (Sam looks through some papers.)
6,17,DEAN,(Dean spots a golden thread on the floor.) Hold on. (He picks it up.) Not nothing.
6,17,DEAN,"(on the phone, he has the thread in his hand) So, we found another piece of this, I don't know, shiny string."
6,17,ELLEN,"(on the phone, in Bobby's kitchen. She cuts up vegetables in front of the stove, then wipes her hands.) Oh, I was afraid of that."
6,17,DEAN,Why? What's up?
6,17,ELLEN,"Oh, these so-called accidents – we're seeing 'em nationwide. About 75 so far. I got Jo and her crew working on a cluster in California. (Ellen sees Bobby opening a beer and takes it from him.)"
6,17,BOBBY,Hey. Hey. Hey.
6,17,DEAN,Blood relatives?
6,17,ELLEN,"Some yeah, some no. She's got about what you do – pile of bodies and a whole bunch of gold thread. (Bobby walks to the stove, smells the food, picks up a vegetable and eats it.)"
6,17,DEAN,So what's it mean?
6,17,ELLEN,I don't know. I got Bobby working on it right now.
6,17,DEAN,"How's he doing, by the way? (Dean gets up.)"
6,17,ELLEN,"Oh, don't worry. I'm kicking his ass back to health and happiness."
6,17,BOBBY,Who asked you to? To hell with you. (Bobby walks out the kitchen.)
6,17,DEAN,I heard that.
6,17,ELLEN,He'll be okay.
6,17,DEAN,Are you okay?
6,17,ELLEN,"Aw, honey, you're sweet. You know me. I just worry about you boys."
6,17,DEAN,"(Dean sits back down.) Yeah, well. All right, so, all these corpses, anything relate 'em?"
6,17,ELLEN,"Well, actually, I did dig up one thing. I just don't know what to make of it. (She puts the beer down and walks to the stove.)"
6,17,DEAN,Hit me.
6,17,ELLEN,"(She scoops a spoonful of food out the pot, smells it and adds some salt.) Well, it's a weird one, and it was buried pretty deep, but Bobby and me were combing through the family trees on all the victims, and we started seeing, well, the families all came over to America the same year."
6,17,DEAN,Hmm.
6,17,ELLEN,Yeah. 1912. But here's the real weird part. They all came over on the same boat.
6,17,DEAN,Really?
6,17,ELLEN,Yep.
6,17,DEAN,"All right, so what's so special about the boat?"
6,17,ELLEN,Nothing. It was a boat. It did what boats do.
6,17,DEAN,What was it called?
6,17,ELLEN,The Titanic. Did you ever hear of it? (She takes a sip of beer.)
6,17,DEAN,No.
6,17,ELLEN,"Yeah, me neither. I'll keep digging."
6,17,DEAN,All right. (Dean hangs up)
6,17,DEAN,Does the name Titanic ring a bell?
6,17,SAM,Titanic? No.
6,17,SAM,(sighs and quotes a website) The RMS Titanic was the largest passenger steamship in the world when it made its maiden voyage across the North Atlantic in 1912.
6,17,DEAN,So what's the big friggin' deal? It's a ship. It sailed.
6,17,SAM,"Yeah, I don't know. Um... Oh, looks like there was a close call. Ship almost
hit an iceberg."
6,17,DEAN,Almost? So?
6,17,SAM,"So, uh, looks like the first mate spotted it just in time."
6,17,DEAN,Good for him. There anything else?
6,17,SAM,Wait a second.
6,17,DEAN,What?
6,17,SAM,"Uh, this first mate. Mr I.P. Freeley."
6,17,DEAN,"Well, that's not suspicious. You got a picture of old Freeley?"
6,17,SAM,"Oh, you got to be kidding me. (The photograph is of Balthazar.)"
6,17,DEAN,(Dean gets up to look at the photo.) Let's see. Balthazar.
6,17,BALTHAZAR,"Boys, boys, boys. Whatever can I do for you?"
6,17,DEAN,We need to talk.
6,17,BALTHAZAR,"Oh, you seem upset, Dean."
6,17,DEAN,"The hell with the boat, Balthazar?"
6,17,BALTHAZAR,What boat?
6,17,SAM,The Titanic.
6,17,BALTHAZAR,"Oh. Ja. The Titanic. Yes, well, uh, it was meant to sink, and I saved it."
6,17,SAM,What?
6,17,BALTHAZAR,"Well it was meant to bash into this iceberg thing and plunge into the briny deep with all this hoopla, and I saved it. Anything else I can answer for you?"
6,17,SAM,Why?
6,17,BALTHAZAR,Why what?
6,17,DEAN,Why did you un-sink the ship?
6,17,BALTHAZAR,"Oh, because I hated the movie."
6,17,DEAN,What movie?
6,17,BALTHAZAR,Exactly. (laughs)
6,17,SAM,"Wait, so you saved a cruise liner because—"
6,17,BALTHAZAR,Because that God-awful Celine Dion song made me want to smite myself.
6,17,SAM,Who's Celine Dion?
6,17,BALTHAZAR,"Oh, she's a destitute lounge singer somewhere in Quebec, and let's keep it that way, please."
6,17,SAM,"Okay, I didn't think that was possible. I thought you couldn't change history."
6,17,BALTHAZAR,"Oh, haven't you noticed? There's no more rules, boys."
6,17,SAM,"(scoffs) Wow. The nerve on you. So you just, what, un-sunk a giant boat?"
6,17,BALTHAZAR,Oh come on. I saved people. I thought you loved that kind of thing.
6,17,SAM,"Yeah, but now those people and their kids and their kids' kids, they must have interacted with – with so many other people, changed so much crap. You totally Butterfly-Effected history!"
6,17,DEAN,"Dude. Dude. Rule one, no Kutcher references."
6,17,BALTHAZAR,"Ah, yes. Unfortunately, there's still an Ashton Kutcher. And you still averted the Apocalypse, and there are still Archangels. It's just the small details that are different, like you don't drive an Impala. (Sam & Dean look confused.) Yes, yes. ""What's an Impala?"" Trust me, it's not important. And, of course, Ellen and Jo are alive. (Balthazar walks over to the counter, picks up a bottle and pours himself a drink.)"
6,17,DEAN,Ellen and Jo? What?
6,17,BALTHAZAR,"Yes, they're supposed to be dead. You see, I save a boat, one thing leads to another, which leads to another thousand things, and yada, yada, yada. To cut a long story short, they don't die in a massive explosion. (He drinks.) Mmm. Anyway, let's agree I did a good thing. One less Billy Zane movie and I saved two of your closest friends."
6,17,SAM,But now somebody is killing the descendants of the survivors.
6,17,BALTHAZAR,And?
6,17,SAM,"And that's maybe like 50,000 people."
6,17,BALTHAZAR,And?
6,17,DEAN,"And we need to save as many as we can, but we need to know who's after 'em."
6,17,BALTHAZAR,"Oh, uh, sorry, uh. You have me confused with the other angel – you know, the one in the dirty trenchcoat who's in love with you. I... don't care. (He takes another sip.) Goodbye, boys."
6,17,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait. Son of a bitch!"
6,17,BOBBY,"(on the phone) So, Balthazar un-sank a boat, and now we got a boatload of people who should never have been born."
6,17,SAM,"(on speakerphone) Yeah. Like 50,000."
6,17,BOBBY,Makes sense.
6,17,SAM,How does any of this make sense?
6,17,BOBBY,Because I got an idea who we're up against.
6,17,DEAN,What?
6,17,BOBBY,Fate.
6,17,DEAN,You mean—?
6,17,BOBBY,"I mean Fate, like the Fates. Or one of 'em, at least. (The book Bobby has in front of him shows three women sitting, holding a long gold thread.)"
6,17,SAM,You mean like Greek mythology? Like the sisters?
6,17,BOBBY,Bingo.
6,17,DEAN,Nerd.
6,17,BOBBY,"These ladies are responsible for how you go down, literally. So if you get creamed by a garage door or crunched by a copy machine, they're the ones who hammer out the details of how you die. Spin out your fate on a piece of pure gold."
6,17,SAM,Gold thread.
6,17,BOBBY,(Takes a sip of coffee.) And then one of 'em writes it all down in her Day Runner of Death. It's high-level stuff. Anyway – fits. Now we know what Balthazar did. It seems to me that maybe Fate is just trying to clean up the mess.
6,17,SAM,"So, how do we stop it?"
6,17,BOBBY,How do we stop Fate? Good question.
6,17,DEAN,"Well, there's got to be a way."
6,17,BOBBY,"Or there ain't. I mean, this is Fate we're talking about here. You know,
the easiest way would be to get that angel to re-sink the boat."
6,17,DEAN,No. No way. Forget it.
6,17,BOBBY,"Big difference between dying awful and never being born, Dean."
6,17,DEAN,"We are not sinking the boat, Bobby. Okay? Don't even think about it."
6,17,BOBBY,"Well, okay. What's got your panties in a clench?"
6,17,DEAN,Nothing.
6,17,BOBBY,Try that again?
6,17,DEAN,"It – Look, it – it – it doesn't even really matter, but..."
6,17,BOBBY,But?
6,17,DEAN,"Apparently, a crapload of dominoes get tipped over if the Titanic
goes down. And, uh, bottom line – Ellen and Jo die."
6,17,BOBBY,"(Looks at the picture of himself and Ellen by the B & E Scrap Yard sign.) Okay, you two. Listen up. You make sure... Keep those angels from sinking that boat. Do you understand me?"
6,17,SAM,Yeah.
6,17,DEAN,Yes.
6,17,SAM,"Yeah, Bobby, of course."
6,17,DEAN,"Oh, he's bad enough with her. Think how he'd be if she was gone."
6,17,SAM,"Yeah. (sighs) So, what do we do? I mean, how do we save 50,000 people?"
6,17,DEAN,I got no freaking clue.
6,17,SAM,Yeah. We don't even know who they are.
6,17,DEAN,"Well, we know one. (Dean points at Shawn Russo's pamphlet.)"
6,17,DEAN,That's him. Let's go.
6,17,RUSSO,(on the phone) Hello. Yeah. What?
6,17,DEAN,Mr. Russo!
6,17,RUSSO,(on the phone) I don't care. Send him a fruitcake.
6,17,DEAN,Shawn!
6,17,RUSSO,(on the phone) Who's the judge?
6,17,DEAN,Russo!
6,17,RUSSO,"(on the phone) All right, send him a nice bottle of champagne. But nothing more than 30—"
6,17,DEAN,Shawn!
6,17,RUSSO,"(on the phone) Ah, no. 20 bucks. Believe me, this guy – he owes me."
6,17,RUSSO,"Get off of me. (to Dean) And you – I told you to leave me alone, didn't I?"
6,17,DEAN,"Look, we're just trying to help you out, okay?"
6,17,RUSSO,"Help me?! You almost killed me, you lunatic. Give me that. (He grabs his cell phone away from Dean.) Unbelievable. (Russo walks away, crossing a street.)"
6,17,DEAN,Russo! Hey!
6,17,RUSSO,(from the middle of the street) Just be glad I'm not suing your a—! (Russo is hit by a bus.)
6,18,BOBBY,I don't believe it. (He shows a map with five crossed marked on it.)
6,18,DEAN,Wyoming? What does that mean?
6,18,BOBBY,(points) Each of these Xs is an abandoned frontier church. (The churches are shown.) All mid-nineteenth century. Built by Samuel Colt.
6,18,DEAN,"Samuel Colt? The demon-killing, gun-making Samuel Colt? (Clip of Azazel being shot with the Colt is shown.)"
6,18,BOBBY,"Yep. He built private railway lines, (Jake pulls up in a car at the railway line) connecting church to church. It just happened to lay out like this. (Bobby draws lines on the map between the Xs, connecting the churches. The resulting shape is a pentagram.)"
6,18,SAM,It's a devil's trap. A hundred square mile devil's trap. (Demons enter the world through the broken railway devil's trap.)
6,18,DEAN,1973.
6,18,DEAN,What is this?
6,18,CASTIEL,What does it look like?
6,18,DEAN,Is it real?
6,18,CASTIEL,Very.
6,18,DEAN,"Okay, so what, angels got their hands on some DeLoreans? How did I get here?"
6,18,CASTIEL,"Time is fluid, Dean. It's not easy but we can bend it, on occasion."
6,18,BOBBY,I'm thinking you know Purgatory. This is all about opening a door to let something in.
6,18,SAM,What?
6,18,BOBBY,I'm working on it.
6,18,DEAN,Can you give us something?
6,18,BOBBY,I got a name. Mother of All.
6,18,DEAN,We've got zero on ganking her.
6,18,EVE,We've got so much to do. Let's get started.
6,18,DEAN,Oh yeah? What's that?
6,18,DEAN,"Elkins, huh?"
6,18,DEAN (excited),We are going into an actual saloon!
6,18,SAM (sternly),"Dean, we don't have much time. Focus."
6,19,CROWLEY,Bring me creatures. Aim high on the food chain.
6,19,SAMUEL,"(A bag is thrown over a djinn's head.) Whatever we bag, ends up there. (The building is shown.) That's where he tortures 'em, interrogates 'em, I don't really know. (The Alpha Shapeshifter, Meg and the Alpha Vampire are tortured.)"
6,19,DEAN,We ain't your employees.
6,19,CROWLEY,'Course you are.
6,19,CROWLEY,What's in the gift bag?
6,19,CASTIEL,You are. (He holds Crowley's skull.)
6,19,CROWLEY,Not possible.
6,19,CASTIEL,You didn't hide your bones as well as you should have.
6,19,DEAN,"Who is she, this Eve bitch?"
6,19,BOBBY,The ashes of a phoenix can burn the mother. (The phoenix catches an iron nail. His hand is burnt.)
6,19,DEAN,"(Reading from Colt's journal) 1861, Sunrise, Wyoming. Gun killed a phoenix today. (Samuel Colt kills two demons with the Colt.) Left a pile of smouldering ash. (The Sheriff's ashes are shown.)"
6,19,SAM,Whose gun?
6,19,DEAN,Colt's.
6,19,DEAN,"We hop back in time, we join up with Samuel Colt, we hunt the phoenix and then haul its ashes back home."
6,19,BOBBY,Is that what I think it is?
6,19,DEAN,Ashes of a phoenix. You know what this means? We take the fight to her.
6,19,MAN #1,"I'm serious, I'm serious. That was way overpriced, dude. Back where I'm from, okay, it was like $3 a beer."
6,19,ED,"Okay, then I'm buying next time."
6,19,MAN #1,I'm not even lying. I'm not even joking at all.
6,19,ED,Hey. Heaven must be missing an angel.
6,19,ED,I think she likes me.
6,19,MAN #1,"Okay, Fabio, let's – let's go. (He leads Ed away.)"
6,19,GUY #1,"Are you okay, miss?"
6,19,EVE,I'm perfect.
6,19,GUY #1,(points at her dress) I mean is – is that blood?
6,19,EVE,(looks down) Yes. I suppose it is.
6,19,GUY #1,You sure you're alright?
6,19,GUY #2,"Hey, what the hell?"
6,19,EVE,I gave him a gift. (She touches a woman's face and the same vein-thing happens.)
6,19,GUY #2,"C'mon, let's get out of here."
6,19,SAM,Hey. How you doing?
6,19,DEAN,Five shells. That's how I'm doing.
6,19,SAM,"(sighs) Well, you know, it's a hell of a lot more than what we had last week."
6,19,DEAN,Maybe.
6,19,BOBBY,Meaning?
6,19,DEAN,"Meaning I just had myself a little mishap a few minutes ago, and, uh, well, here, look. (Dean rubs ashes on his arm. Nothing happens.)"
6,19,SAM,Whoa.
6,19,BOBBY,Huh.
6,19,DEAN,"I mean this stuff is supposed to burn the bejeezus out of Eve, doesn't even give me a sunburn."
6,19,BOBBY,Lore says it works.
6,19,DEAN,That's always reliable.
6,19,SAM,"Well, you know what? Maybe it's like, uh – maybe it's like iron or silver. You know? Hurts them, not us."
6,19,DEAN,"Maybe, but a fat lot of good it does us 'til we find the bitch."
6,19,BOBBY,"I'm looking, but I'm thinking maybe it's time you made a call."
6,19,DEAN,"Why has it always got to be me that makes the call, huh? It's not like Cas lives in my ass. The dude's busy. (Cas appears behind him. Dean turns around, surprised.) Cas, get out of my ass!"
6,19,CAS,I was never in your – (Dean gives him a look.) Have you made any progress in locating Eve?
6,19,BOBBY,Well we were gonna ask you about that.
6,19,CAS,"No, I've looked, but she's hidden from me. She's hidden from all angels."
6,19,DEAN,Awesome.
6,19,SAM,"You know, what we really need is an inside man."
6,19,DEAN,What do you mean?
6,19,SAM,Something with claws and sympathy.
6,19,DEAN,"Like a friendly monster? (Sam shrugs.) Those are in short supply these days, don't you think?"
6,19,SAM,"Sure, but we've met one or two, right?"
6,19,DEAN,Maybe.
6,19,SAM,So we can find one.
6,19,SAM,Lenore.
6,19,SAM,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey. Lenore, stop. Look, we're happy you're here."
6,19,DEAN,Been a long time. You remember us?
6,19,LENORE,I remember. Your hunter friend almost killed me.
6,19,SAM,"Well if it makes you feel any better, uh, he turned into a vampire and I chopped his head off."
6,19,DEAN,Yeah. With razor wire. Wicked.
6,19,LENORE,"Well, that's something. What's going on? Why am I here?"
6,19,SAM,"Well, um, that's Cas. (Sam points.) He's our friend. And we need to talk to you. About Eve."
6,19,LENORE,Eve? I have nothing to say about Eve.
6,19,DEAN,You sure about that?
6,19,LENORE,"I'm trying to stay away from her, believe me."
6,19,SAM,Where's your nest?
6,19,LENORE,"Gone. They couldn't fight it anymore. It's her voice, in our heads. What it does to us. So they left. Started killing again."
6,19,SAM,But not you.
6,19,LENORE,Don't look so impressed. I was hiding in a basement. Not exactly Club Med. You don't know how hard it is – not to give in. Everyone gives in.
6,19,DEAN,"Alright, so this psychic two-way you've got going, does that mean you know where Mom's camped out?"
6,19,LENORE,You've got to be kidding me. You want me to tell you where she is? You do know she could be listening to us right now. I might as well be a video camera. What are you thinking?
6,19,BOBBY,"So we don't have the element of surprise, we're still going in."
6,19,LENORE,You're crazy. I can't help you.
6,19,SAM,"Can't or won't? Look, it's clear as day. You still give a crap. You don't wanna kill. And don't want this whole planet dead."
6,19,LENORE,You actually believe you can stop her?
6,19,SAM,Just tell us where she is.
6,19,LENORE,"Grants Pass, Oregon. And now she knows you're coming."
6,19,BOBBY,Well let's go see.
6,19,LENORE,Hold on. I didn't tell you this out of the goodness of my heart. I need something.
6,19,SAM,What?
6,19,LENORE,Kill me.
6,19,SAM,Lenore.
6,19,DEAN,"Look, we'll lock down down 'til this whole thing's over, okay? Witness protection, you'll be safe."
6,19,LENORE,"You don't get it, it's not about that. I'm dangerous. I hear her voice all the time."
6,19,SAM,You're not like the rest of them.
6,19,LENORE,"I'm exactly like them. I fed. I couldn't help it. The girl couldn't have been more than 16, Sam. I'll do it again. I can't stop, not anymore. You have to. Please."
6,19,SAM,Lenore.
6,19,CAS,We needed to move this along.
6,19,DEAN,"Well, I was expecting more Zombieland, less Pleasantville."
6,19,BOBBY,"Just because it looks quiet, don't mean it is, especially if she's got a clue were coming."
6,19,DEAN,"Yeah, well if she is here I'm glad we've got Smitey McSmiterton on our squad. Alright, where do we start?"
6,19,BOBBY,I'm gonna need a computer.
6,19,BOBBY,"Alright. I finally got the police database, no thanks to this. (He gestures to the iPad.) I asked for a computer."
6,19,SAM,It is a computer.
6,19,BOBBY,"No, a computer has buttons."
6,19,WAITRESS,Can I get you anything else?
6,19,DEAN,"No, we're good thanks."
6,19,SAM,Anything?
6,19,BOBBY,"Oh, nickel and dime stuff, nothing weird.(The news he's reading is about a meth lab.) Basically dead end. You think Vampira was lying?"
6,19,CAS,I'll search the town. Give me a moment. (Nothing happens.)
6,19,DEAN,"Cas, we can still see you."
6,19,CAS,"Yeah, I'm still here."
6,19,DEAN,"Okay, well you don't have to wait on us, you -"
6,19,CAS,(clears his throat and strains)
6,19,DEAN,Well now it just looks like you're pooping.
6,19,CAS,Something's wrong.
6,19,DEAN,"What, are you stuck?"
6,19,CAS,I'm blocked. I'm powerless.
6,19,DEAN,You're joking?
6,19,CAS,"Something in this town, is, uh, it's affecting me. I assume it's Eve."
6,19,DEAN,"So wait, Mom's making you limp?"
6,19,CAS,"Figuratively, yes."
6,19,DEAN,How?
6,19,CAS,"I don't know, but she is."
6,19,DEAN,"Well, that's great, because without your power, you're basically just a baby in a trenchcoat. (Cas looks upset.)"
6,19,SAM,I think you hurt his feelings.
6,19,BOBBY,"(He's found a news story on the iPad.) I got something here, maybe. Had to go federal go to get it. Call went out from the local office to the CDC last night."
6,19,SAM,About what?
6,19,BOBBY,"A Dr Silver called in an illness he couldn't identify. Patient's a 25 year old, African-American, name – Ed Bright. (He shows them Ed's driver's licence.)"
6,19,DEAN,Well that's not much to go on.
6,19,BOBBY,"Well its only lead, so -"
6,19,DEAN,"So beggars can't be choosers, right? I get it. Alright, let's finish up."
6,19,DEAN,"Excuse me. Hi, uh, i-is Dr Silver in today? (points to Cas) My friend is very sick."
6,19,CAS,"I have a, uh, painful burning sensation."
6,19,WOMAN,"Oh, well, he's out. Sorry."
6,19,DEAN,Do you happen to know here he is?
6,19,WOMAN,He hasn't called in. You might want to find yourself some ointment. (She walks off.)
6,19,DEAN,"What kind of doctor calls the CDC and then goes AWOL the very nest day? Let's have a look, shall we?"
6,19,CAS,Is this gonna take a long time?
6,19,CAS,What is it?
6,19,DEAN,Ohh.
6,19,CAS,It's the patient Ed Bright.
6,19,DEAN,Well what kind of doctor calls the CDC and then stashes the gooey corpse in the shed?
6,19,CAS,I don't understand what's happening here.
6,19,DEAN,"Well, I know one thing about the body. We need some kerosene."
6,19,BOBBY,"Here, Dr Silver. Wife, two sons. (Sam takes the photo.) Uh oh."
6,19,SHERIFF,Hi there.
6,19,SAM,Hi.
6,19,SHERIFF,Who're you?
6,19,SHERIFF,"(Noticing they're wearing normal clothes and not uniforms.) It Casual Friday, agents?"
6,19,SAM,We're on a case a few miles out. We got a call to come here.
6,19,BOBBY,"So how about you, what's your business?"
6,19,SHERIFF,"Oh, Dr Silver's a friend of mine. Heard he didn't show up for work today, so I though I'd stop by, see if he's sick."
6,19,BOBBY,Not sick. Missing.
6,19,SHERIFF,Missing? Says who?
6,19,BOBBY,"Says me. Empty house, no bags packed, car's still in the driveway."
6,19,SHERIFF,How'd you get on this?
6,19,BOBBY,"Oh, it's a long story. Tell you what, why don't you put out an APB, we'll compare notes down at the station. Sound good?"
6,19,SHERIFF,"Uh, yeah, yeah. Sure."
6,19,BOBBY,Obliged.
6,19,SAM,Wow. Talk about talking out of your butt.
6,19,BOBBY,"Yeah. Just hurry, you idjit."
6,19,DEAN,"Oh. So we've got a missing doctor and an oozy patient, huh?"
6,19,SAM,Yeah. Plot thickens.
6,19,DEAN,Well let's go see what Ed's roommates have to say.
6,19,CAS,Does Ed Bright have a brother?
6,19,BOBBY,"No, why?"
6,19,CAS,Then that's not his twin. (Through the window they see someone who looks exactly like Ed.)
6,19,SAM,"So what, shifter?"
6,19,BOBBY,I don't know what we're looking at.
6,19,SAM,"Alright, Dean and me are gonna go in. You two stay here and watch the door. If something comes out, shoot it."
6,19,DEAN,Yeah. Best guess – silver bullets.
6,19,CAS,I'm fairly unpractised with firearms.
6,19,DEAN,You know who whines? Babies.
6,19,DEAN,"Okay, don't touch anything."
6,19,SAM,"Hey, hey. Back here. Come here. (They approach him.) Hey, hey, hey. ('Ed' coughs) Talk to us. What is it?"
6,19,DEAN,"Hey, Ed. Ed, what's going on?"
6,19,'ED',What? I'm not Ed. (he coughs and groans)
6,19,MARSHALL,(groans) What's wrong with me?
6,19,SAM,"Uh, nothing. You're ok. You're okay, alright? We're gonna get you help."
6,19,MARSHALL,Let me ask you something. Do I – do all of us- do we look like Ed?
6,19,DEAN,"What? No, no. No, no, no, no, no, of course not. You, uh, you have a fever. You're hallucinating."
6,19,SAM,"Marshall, Marshall. Hey, what happened here?"
6,19,MARSHALL,Am I gonna die?
6,19,SAM,"No, you're not gonna die, okay? Now you need to talk to us. It's important."
6,19,MARSHALL,(splutters) Ed was feeling bad so I took him to the doctor. (coughs) I think – now we're all sick.
6,19,DEAN,You think?
6,19,SAM,"And before you got sick, before Ed got sick, did you do anything? Did you go anywhere? Hey, I need you to focus for me."
6,19,MARSHALL,I don't know. Some bar.
6,19,SAM,A bar? What bar?
6,19,MARSHALL,"8th Street, I guess."
6,19,SAM,"8th Street, um, did anything happen at the bar? Did you – did you see anything? Did you meet anyone?"
6,19,SAM,"Look, an ambulance is on the way, okay?"
6,19,MARSHALL,A girl.
6,19,DEAN,"A girl? Okay, and?"
6,19,MARSHALL,A girl in white.
6,19,DEAN,"Good, okay. What did the girl in white do? Marshall? Wh-wh-what did she do to Ed? Marshall?"
6,19,DEAN,"I don't get it. What, a bunch of regular Joes wake up shifters? What the hell?"
6,19,BOBBY,Shifters usually run in families. This looks like an infection. Nobody touched nothing?
6,19,DEAN,Well I am bathing in Purell tonight.
6,19,SAM,"So, he said they met a girl."
6,19,DEAN,It's got to be Eve.
6,19,CAS,But why would she do this?
6,19,BOBBY,Mommy monster – make more.
6,19,DEAN,"No, no, no, no. Cas has got a good point. I mean if she's gonna make a shifter army, why make one that's sick, gooey and dying?"
6,19,BOBBY,(shrugs) Add that to the pile of Crap That Don't Make Sense.
6,19,SAM,So should we hit the bar?
6,19,BOBBY,"Well, the Sheriff's a moot, but still. You'd think he'd notice this many missing folks."
6,19,DEAN,We got a vamp over here. (Dean lifts the body's arm. A spike is protruding from its wrist.) Nope. Scratch that. We got a wraith. What the hell? What has teeth and a spike?
6,19,BOBBY,Never seen that in my life.
6,19,DEAN,"Oh, great. So Eve's making hybrids now?"
6,19,BOBBY,Looks like.
6,19,DEAN,"Yeah, the question is why. I mean what does she want with the – what do you call these?"
6,19,BOBBY,"Well, congrats. You discovered it. You get to name it."
6,19,DEAN,"Jefferson Starships. (Bobby and Sam look confused.) Huh, because they're horrible – and hard to kill."
6,19,SAM,Looks like the whole bar has been turned into these –
6,19,DEAN,– Jefferson Starships.
6,19,SAM,Fine. But why are all the... Starships dead?
6,19,BOBBY,"I can't say, but looks like they all burned up."
6,19,DEAN,"Burned up, like?"
6,19,BOBBY,"Like a high fever, like the flu."
6,19,DEAN,What the hell's going on here? Does every monster in this town have the motaba virus?
6,19,SHERIFF,Hands where I can see 'em!
6,19,CAS,Now this is not what it looks like.
6,19,BOBBY,"Look, we're the Feds."
6,19,SHERIFF,Yeah? Well Feds are not allowed to do this. Cuff 'em. Turn around.
6,19,SAM,"Listen, if we can make a phone call, we can straighten this all out."
6,19,SHERIFF,Straighten out a massacre? I'd like to see you try.
6,19,SAM,J-Jefferson Starships!
6,19,SAM,"Dean, wait!"
6,19,BOBBY,"Well, I'll say this, you're the healthiest looking specimen I've seen all day."
6,19,SHERIFF,I take my vitamins.
6,19,BOBBY,"So you wanna tell us what's going on here? Hmm? (Sam & Dean watch from outside the window.) So you boys are, uh, Eve's cleaning crew, is that it? You, uh – you come around to clean up the bodies? Make sure the word doesn't get out, huh? Is that why you snatched up the doctor?"
6,19,SHERIFF,(sighs) You're so wasting your time. You stupid head of cattle. (laughs)
6,19,DEAN,More Starships. (Dean walks off to investigate.)
6,19,SAM,"(to Cas) Stay here. (Sam goes after Dean. They follow blood on the wall which leads them to the cells. In one cell are two boys, tied up and gagged. Sam recognises them from the photo.)"
6,19,SAM,"You're Dr Silver's boys. (The older one nods.) Alright, don't worry. We're gonna get you out of here, okay? Uh, keys?"
6,19,DEAN,Yeah. (He goes to find the keys.)
6,19,SAM,"Look. We're not gonna hurt you. My name is Sam. That's my brother, Dean. (Dean brings the keys and opens the cell.) Those cops, they're not coming back – ever."
6,19,SAM,What are your names?
6,19,JOE,Joe. This is Ryan.
6,19,DEAN,"Hey Ryan, how you doing?"
6,19,JOE,"He won't talk, not since they came for us."
6,19,DEAN,"Alright, listen Joe. We're gonna get you out of those handcuffs. Um, but you understand what's going on around here, don't you? (Joe nods.) So first we've gotta make sure you're you."
6,19,JOE,How you gonna do that?
6,19,DEAN,"Well there's a few, uh, dozen tests. Okay, let's get started."
6,19,SHERIFF,"(groans, then laughs) You really think that's gonna make me talk?"
6,19,BOBBY,Something will.
6,19,DEAN,Got a couple of hungry human boys here. C'mon guys. (He leads them away.)
6,19,SAM,"So you two never heard 'em talk... about a mother, or someone named Eve?"
6,19,JOE,(shakes his head) It was just me and Ryan in there.
6,19,DEAN,And your folks?
6,19,JOE,Cops said we were next. He said we were food.
6,19,DEAN,You have any other family?
6,19,JOE,"An uncle, in Merritt."
6,19,DEAN,"Merritt, what's that, like 15 miles outside of town? Okay. We'll get you there."
6,19,CAS,"Dean, can I have a word?"
6,19,CAS,We need to find Eve now.
6,19,DEAN,Yeah. Go. Me and Sam just gotta make a milk run.
6,19,CAS,We need your help here.
6,19,DEAN,Hold your water. We'll be back in a few.
6,19,CAS,"Dean, Dean. Millions of lives are at stakes here, not just two. Stay focused."
6,19,DEAN,Are you kidding?
6,19,CAS,There's a greater purpose here.
6,19,DEAN,"You know what, I-I'm getting a little sick and tired of the greater purposes, okay? I think what I'd like to do now is save a couple of kids. If you don't mind. We'll catch up. Okay guys, let's go. C'mon. (Dean walks out. Joe, Ryan and Sam follow.)"
6,19,JOE,"(to Ryan) Hey, you should get some rest. (He wraps his arm around his brother.)"
6,19,BOBBY,They won't take long.
6,19,CAS,You don't know that. They may find more wayward orphans along the way.
6,19,BOBBY,"Oh, don't get cute."
6,19,CAS,"Right. Pardon me for highlighting their crippling and dangerous empathetic response with ""sarcasm"". It was a bad idea – letting them go."
6,19,BOBBY,"Come on. You don't let Sam and Dean Winchester do squat. They got what they gotta. You know that. Anyway, we want Eve, we need coordinates. So we can stand here bellyaching or we can go poke that pig 'til he squeals. Thoughts?"
6,19,SHERIFF,"You know, she can see you right now. And you're just making her mad."
6,19,BOBBY,Then tell the bitch to come get me.
6,19,CAS,I need five minutes alone with him.
6,19,BOBBY,"What for? Cas, your batteries are dead."
6,19,CAS,Give me five minutes.
6,19,BOBBY,"Alright, fine."
6,19,CAS,Eve's at 25 Buckley Street. You can call Sam and Dean.
6,19,DEAN,"Rigorous interrogation, huh?"
6,19,BOBBY,"Well, we got a location. Now we just gotta get close enough to take a shot."
6,19,DEAN,"Alright. Well, let's all take one. (Dean takes the shells containing phoenix ash out of his pocket. Sam, Bobby, Cas and Dean each take one.) Load 'em up. Make 'em count."
6,19,DEAN,You gotta be kidding me. She's been in there the whole time?
6,19,SAM,Why'd she ever let us in? Or out?
6,19,DEAN,Well there's one way to find out.
6,19,BOBBY,"What, just stroll in? We don't know who's human or who's her."
6,19,DEAN,Well there's one way to draw her out. Me and Sam will go in.
6,19,BOBBY,Dean.
6,19,DEAN,"Look. If we don't get a shot off, you two better."
6,19,BOBBY,That's the plan?
6,19,DEAN,Yeah. Pretty much.
6,19,BOBBY,(sighs) Well at least it ain't complicated.
6,19,SAM,(clears his throat)
6,19,DEAN,Now what?
6,19,SAM,"(Sam uses his phone's camera to see if anyone's eye's are glowing. Everyone's are. They're all Starships.) Crap. Crap, crap."
6,19,DEAN,Starships?
6,19,SAM,Yeah.
6,19,DEAN,Is there anybody in this diner that is not a flesh-eating monster?
6,19,SAM,"Uh, me and you."
6,19,DEAN,"Okay, well let's get the hell out of here."
6,19,SAM,Shall we?
6,19,SAM,"Uh, no, that's not for us. We were just headed out."
6,19,EVE,"Now that would be rude, Sam."
6,19,SAM,Let me guess. Eve.
6,19,EVE,Pleasure.
6,19,DEAN,Why don't we step outside. Chat?
6,19,EVE,Why? This is private.
6,19,EVE,Phoenix ash. I'm impressed. I bet you had to go a long way for that.
6,19,DEAN,You have no idea.
6,19,EVE,(to a Starship) Destroy these. Thank you. (He takes the guns.) (to Sam and Dean) Relax. I'm not here to fight.
6,19,DEAN,"No? Just to rally every freak on the planet, bring in Khan Worms and-and half-assed spider-men, and dragons. Really, sister? Dragons?"
6,19,EVE,So I dusted off some of the old classics. I needed help.
6,19,SAM,With what? (scoffs) Tearing apart the planet?
6,19,EVE,You misunderstand me. I never wanted that. Not at first. (Sam scoffs.) I liked our arrangement.
6,19,SAM,What arrangement?
6,19,EVE,"The natural order. My children turned a few of you, you hunted a few of them. I was happy."
6,19,DEAN,"Okay, so what changed?"
6,19,EVE,"My children, no thanks to you, started getting kidnapped and tortured. Even my first borns. I was pushed into this. After all, a mother defends her children."
6,19,DEAN,Really? You're gonna use the Mother of The Year defence? You?
6,19,EVE,It happens to be true. Know what? Maybe you'll believe it if I look a little more like this.
6,19,DEAN,"Oh, you bitch."
6,19,EVE,"She died to protect you, didn't she? See. You understand a mother's love. I'm no different."
6,19,DEAN,"Alright, you know what? This conversation's over. If you're gonna kill us, kill us."
6,19,EVE,You? No. It's Crowley I want dead.
6,19,DEAN,Well you're too late there – that little limey mook roasted months ago.
6,19,EVE,Crowley's alive.
6,19,SAM,That's impossible.
6,19,EVE,(scoffs) I see his face through the eyes of every child he strings up and skins. Any idea why he's hurting my babies?
6,19,DEAN,"He wants Purgatory, right? Location, location, location."
6,19,EVE,(laughs) Is that what he told you? It's about the souls.
6,19,SAM,(scoffs) What about 'em?
6,19,EVE,"Their power, you simple little monkey. Fuel. Each soul a beautiful little nuclear reactor. Put 'em together, you have the sun. Now think what the king of hell could do with that vast, untapped oil well. How powerful he'd be. Now Crowley wants to siphon off my supply, and torture my children to do it? Okay fine. I'll quite playing nice. I'll turn you all. Every soul, mine. Let's see how hot his hell burns when everyone comes to me. He asked for it."
6,19,DEAN,"You know, last I checked, there were a few billion of us. That plan might take a while."
6,19,EVE,What exactly o you think I'm doing here? I'm building the perfect beast.
6,19,SAM,"Wait a second, all those – all those things we've been finding."
6,19,EVE,Call it beta testing.
6,19,DEAN,"Well, I think your formula might be a little off.  They're imploding all over town."
6,19,EVE,"Oh, there were a few unfortunate failures. But I eventually got it right. Quiet, smart, inconspicuous. It can spread through a whole town in under a day, oh and the best part – you've been with it the whole time."
6,19,DEAN,What?
6,19,EVE,"Yes, you were the final test. I had to see if it could slip past hunters undetected, of course. (Eve smiles.) Little Ryan."
6,19,UNCLE,Joe?
6,19,UNCLE,Ryan?
6,19,EVE,"You look upset. If it makes you feel any better, Ryan was bound to work on you. Little wayward orphan, like yourselves. There's nothing you can do about it now. So let's talk."
6,19,SAM,(scoffs) Nothing to say.
6,19,EVE,"Well, that's where you're wrong. I have an offer to propose. Crowley. As you know, not so easy to find. So, here's the deal. You find him, bring him to me – I let you live."
6,19,DEAN,Pass.
6,19,SAM,Dean.
6,19,DEAN,"Sam, no. The answer is no."
6,19,EVE,You say that like you have another option.
6,19,DEAN,"Maybe I do, maybe I don't."
6,19,EVE,You think?
6,19,EVE,"Well, so much for your plan B. (to Cas) And you, wondering why so flaccid? I'm older than you, Castiel. I know what makes angels tick. Long as I'm around, consider yourself unplugged. (to Sam & Dean) Work for me. It's a good deal. Bonus, I won't kill your friends."
6,19,DEAN,"Alright, look. The last few months we've been working for an evil dick. We're not about to sign up for an evil bitch. We don't work with demons. We don't work with monsters. And if that means you gotta kill us, then kill us!"
6,19,EVE,"Or, I turn you. And you do what I want anyway."
6,19,DEAN,"Beat me with a wire hanger, answer's still no."
6,19,EVE,Don't test me.
6,19,DEAN,Bite me.
6,19,SAM,No!
6,19,CAS,Dean!
6,19,DEAN,"Phoenix ash. One shell, one ounce of whisky. Down the hatch. Little musty on the afterburn. Call you later, Mom."
6,19,CAS,Shut your eyes!
6,19,BOBBY,We got to take you on more monster hunts.
6,19,SAM,"(sighs) Hey Cas, um, Dean's bleeding pretty good."
6,19,DEAN,"Yeah, I think she turned me into a Jefferson Starship. Could you clear that up too?"
6,19,DEAN,"Alright, we're good. We got to go. Now."
6,19,CAS,Where?
6,19,DEAN,The kid. The little kid. He's one of 'em.
6,19,CAS,Unbelievable.
6,19,DEAN,"Yeah, I know Cas, you told me, alright. Let's just go."
6,19,DEAN,So we kill the wicked witch and she still wins. I mean they could've turned half the town by now. (Cas is about to say something) Don't say it.
6,19,BOBBY,Found 'em.
6,19,DEAN,"Well, who ganked them?"
6,19,SAM,Demons.
6,19,SAM,So what do you think?
6,19,DEAN,I think that demons don't give a crap about monster tweens unless they're told to.
6,19,SAM,So you think she was telling the truth?
6,19,CAS,The truth about what?
6,19,DEAN,She said that Crowley's still kicking.
6,19,CAS,"But I burned his bones, how c—? Was she certain?"
6,19,DEAN,"Sounded pretty sure. According to her, Crowley's still waterboarding her kids, somewhere."
6,19,CAS,I don't understand.
6,19,DEAN,"Well, he is a crafty son of a bitch."
6,19,CAS,I'm an angel. I'll look into it immediately. (Cas disappears.)
6,19,DEAN,Cas! Let us know what you find out!
6,19,DEAN,What? What?
6,19,DEAN,Unless what?
6,19,BOBBY,Unless he meant to.
6,19,DEAN,"Bobby, this is Cas we're talking about. (to Sam) Do you believe this? (Sam doesn't answer.) Sam?"
6,19,SAM,"(sighs) Look it's probably nothing, it's just... You know what? You're right. It's – it's probably nothing."
6,19,CROWLEY,"Really, Cas? This is getting ridiculous. How many times am I gonna have to clean up your messes?"
6,20,DEAN,"We're gonna find a way to beat the devil, okay?"
6,20,SAM,What if you guys lead the devil to the edge and I jump in?
6,20,SAM,(to Lucifer) Yes.
6,20,LUCIFER,Sammy's long gone.
6,20,DEAN,(to Cas) What are you gonna do now?
6,20,CAS,"Return to Heaven, I suppose."
6,20,DEAN,Heaven?
6,20,CAS,"With Michael in the cage, I'm sure it's total anarchy up there."
6,20,DEAN,"So, what, you're the new sheriff in town?"
6,20,CAS,"It's Civil War up there. If we can beat Raphael, we can end this."
6,20,CAS,"When the oil burns, no angel can touch or pass through the flames or he dies."
6,20,CAS,"It's his soul, it's gone."
6,20,SAM,Purgatory.
6,20,CROWLEY,And I want it.
6,20,DEATH,The human soul is more valuable than you can imagine.
6,20,ATROPOS,This is about the souls. That angel went and created 50 000 new souls for your war machine.
6,20,SAM,"Eve, the mother of all."
6,20,EVE,It's Crowley I want dead.
6,20,EVE,Crowley's alive.
6,20,CROWLEY,"Really, Cas? This is getting ridiculous. How many times am I gonna have to clean up your messes?"
6,21,LISA,"I know what I want, (Dean kisses her on the forehead) but I can't have it. Not how you live. I'm trying to get over you."
6,21,BEN,"You know you're walking out on your family, right?"
6,21,DEAN,What do you know about dragons?
6,21,BOBBY,"Dr Visyak, Medieval Studies, SFU."
6,21,CASTIEL,Raphael.
6,21,RAPHAEL,"Tomorrow you kneel, Castiel."
6,21,CROWLEY,"Ding, ding, ding."
6,21,BALTHAZAR,Of course I want to help you.
6,21,CROWLEY,But what if I said I knew how to go nuclear? Purgatory.
6,21,CASTIEL,No.
6,21,CROWLEY,Then I'll do it myself.
6,21,CASTIEL,"If you touch a hair on their heads, I will tear it all down. Our arrangement."
6,21,DEAN,"You're like a brother to me. So if I'm asking you not to do something, you gotta trust me, man."
6,21,CASTIEL,Or what?
6,21,DEAN,Or I'll have to do what I have to do to stop you.
6,21,CASTIEL,"I'm sorry, Dean."
6,21,LOVECRAFT,Hello?
6,21,LOVECRAFT,Hello?
6,21,LOVECRAFT,Please. We didn't know. I'm sorry.
6,21,SAM,"Well, you know what, at least you tried."
6,21,DEAN,"Yeah, fat lot of good it did. Why did he even come, right?"
6,21,DEAN,"Well, Samuel's journals are pointless. I mean, I'm sorry, but uh, Jebediah Campbell has squat to tell me about how to stop Cas from cracking Purgatory."
6,21,BOBBY,"Well actually, it's not about the journals we have, it's about the one we don't."
6,21,SAM,Meaning what?
6,21,BOBBY,"Well, that's the bad news. Our pal Cas didn't stop in last night just to mend fences."
6,21,DEAN,What did he do?
6,21,BOBBY,Stole something.
6,21,DEAN,What?
6,21,BOBBY,The journal of one Moishe Campbell.
6,21,SAM,Moishe?
6,21,BOBBY,Of the New York Campbells.
6,21,SAM,"Well, uh, so we gotta get it back, right?"
6,21,BOBBY,"(He holds up the envelope and hands it to Sam.) Or just read the copy I'd already made. Hi, glad to meet you. Bobby Singer. Paranoid bastard."
6,21,BOBBY,I think I zeroed in on something.
6,21,DEAN,What do you got?
6,21,DEAN,"""Went to talk to Howard Phillips about the events of March 10th."""
6,21,BOBBY,"That's March 10th, 1937."
6,21,DEAN,Alright. So  who's this Phillips guy?
6,21,BOBBY,Phillips ain't his last name. It's Lovecraft.
6,21,SAM,"Wait, H.P. Lovecraft? (Bobby nods.) Let me see that. (Dean gives him the paper.)"
6,21,DEAN,Am I supposed to know who that is?
6,21,BOBBY,"(surprised that Dean doesn't know) Horror writer. At the Mountains Of Madness, The Call of Cthulu?"
6,21,DEAN,"Yeah, it's - no, I'm - I was too busy having sex with women."
6,21,BOBBY,"(rolls eyes) Well, anyhow. There's one notion that comes up over and over again in his stories. Namely opening doors to other dimensions and letting scary crap through."
6,21,DEAN,You don't say.
6,21,SAM,"Wait, so you're saying you think Lovecraft knew something about Purgatory?"
6,21,BOBBY,All I know is Moishe paid him a visit.
6,21,BASEBALL COMMENTATOR,"And he's four for his last seven against with uh, two extra base hits... He dives back in..."
6,21,LISA,No!
6,21,MATT,"Just let her go, okay? Just -"
6,21,LISA,No!
6,21,LISA,No! (She screams)
6,21,DEAN,Ben?
6,21,BEN,(frantic) There's men in the house.
6,21,DEAN,What?
6,21,BEN,"They killed Matt. They got Mom. They're coming, I hear them."
6,21,DEAN,What are they?
6,21,BEN,I - I don't know.
6,21,DEAN,Did you see their eyes?
6,21,BEN,No.
6,21,DEAN,Teeth?
6,21,BEN,No.
6,21,DEAN,"This is important Ben, I need to know."
6,21,BEN,"Dean, I don't know."
6,21,DEAN,"Okay, where are you now?"
6,21,BEN,In my room.
6,21,DEAN,Can you get to your mom's closet? I left a shotgun in there.
6,21,BEN,"No. Dean, what do I do?"
6,21,DEAN,"Okay, Ben, listen to me. Go to your window and jump."
6,21,BEN,What?!
6,21,DEAN,"Any bones you break won't compare to what they're gonna do to you, Ben. You've got to jump."
6,21,BEN,"Okay, I'm going."
6,21,DEAN,I'm coming right now.
6,21,DEAN,"I'm coming to get you and your mom, I promise. You with me, Ben? Ben? (There's no answer.) Ben?"
6,21,CROWLEY,"Hello, Dean."
6,21,CROWLEY,Fancy a chat?
6,21,CROWLEY,"God, how long's it been, Dean? Since my so-called demise, yes?"
6,21,CROWLEY,"Right, right. You'll rip me a cornucopia of orifices. Let's get to the bit where I tell you how this goes. Your chocolate's been in my peanut butter for far too long."
6,21,DEAN,I am going to kill you.
6,21,CROWLEY,"Oh Dean, ever the wit. I've got your uh, oh what are they? Ex lady friend and not-kid, and I'm keeping them until I'm satisfied that you've backed the hell off!"
6,21,DEAN,"I'm telling you, last chance to let 'em go easy."
6,21,CROWLEY,"You're adorable when you get all threatening. Don't worry, I won't hurt them. Provided you and Jolly Green stand down. Got it? Splendid. Kisses. (Crowley hangs up.)"
6,21,BOBBY,What's the story?
6,21,DEAN,He said Lisa and Ben keep breathing as long as we sit on our thumbs.
6,21,SAM,(sighs) You think Cas knows about this?
6,21,DEAN,We gotta assume he does.
6,21,SAM,So what are we gonna do?
6,21,SAM,I'm coming with.
6,21,DEAN,"No, Sam. You and Bobby stay on the Lovecraft thing, okay? Cas is already way ahead of us."
6,21,SAM,You gotta be nuts if you think I'm gonna let you do this alone. Bobby can take care of the case.
6,21,BOBBY,"(stands up) No, guys."
6,21,DEAN,"Bobby, this is a big ball, okay? We can't drop it now."
6,21,BOBBY,Fine. But how are you two gonna find Lisa and Ben?
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"I'm sorry boys, do I look like a man-servant to you? No? No? Then quit ringing for me, please."
6,21,DEAN,"This is important, Balthazar."
6,21,SAM,Crowley's alive. (Sam nods.)
6,21,BALTHAZAR,Well you've been scooped. Cas already told me.
6,21,DEAN,"Well did Cas tell you that he is Crowley's butt-buddy, you smug little dick?"
6,21,BALTHAZAR,Excuse me?
6,21,SAM,Handshake deal. Go halfsies on all the souls of Purgatory. He fill you in on that?
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"Well, yes, yes. Yes, of course he did. Yes. (Balthazar is clearly lying.)"
6,21,SAM,"Oh, yes, of course. I - I - we can read it all over your face."
6,21,DEAN,"Look, Crowley and Cas took two people who are very important to me."
6,21,BALTHAZAR,And I care about this because?
6,21,DEAN,Because maybe there is a shred of decency underneath this - this snarky crap. (Balthazar sips his drink.) They're innocent people and I'm asking for your help.
6,21,BALTHAZAR,Hmmm. I see. Fair enough.
6,21,DEAN,Son of a bitch!
6,21,SAM,"Look, Dean. Let's just call Cas. Maybe he doesn't know anything about this."
6,21,DEAN,We are not calling Cas.
6,21,SAM,"Yeah, but Dean."
6,21,DEAN,We're not calling Cas!
6,21,SAM,So what then?
6,21,JUDAH,"You know, uh, horror - lowbrow. Put us in the ghetto, fine. But H.P. Lovecraft, this guy is literature. I mean he - he - he should be taught in schools. He's up there with Dickens and Dean R. Koontz, seriously."
6,21,BOBBY,"Well that's, that's definitely the angle I'm taking with my piece."
6,21,JUDAH,"Oh, okay. Okay. Sorry, you - please. (He gestures for Bobby to sit. They both do.)"
6,21,BOBBY,"So, I hear you have a large collection of Lovecraft's private letters."
6,21,JUDAH,"Huh, yeah. World's largest."
6,21,BOBBY,Wow. You must be catnip to the ladies.
6,21,JUDAH,"(chuckles) I'm in a long-term online relationship, so..."
6,21,BOBBY,"Well, um, I'd like to ask you about Lovecraft's last years. Specifically, anything that might've gone down around March 10th, 1937."
6,21,JUDAH,Are- ? Okay. Are - are you working on this with the other guy?
6,21,BOBBY,Other guy?
6,21,JUDAH,"Yeah, uh, you know, trenchcoat, looks like Columbo, talks like Rain Man."
6,21,BOBBY,Right. We're... competitors.Rival magazines.
6,21,JUDAH,"(laughs) Oh, okay.  Okay, well um, I'll tell you what I told him. Howard had a dinner party on March 10th."
6,21,BOBBY,Party? How many friends at this party?
6,21,JUDAH,"Well, six. If by ""friends"" you mean co-worshippers in a black magic cult. They were getting together that night to perform a ritual. Something big."
6,21,BOBBY,"Define ""big""."
6,21,JUDAH,Not much. Just open a door into another dimension.
6,21,BOBBY,Why would they do that?
6,21,JUDAH,"To see what's out there, you know. Maybe it's friendly."
6,21,BOBBY,"It's never friendly. (Judah gives him a look.) I mean, I imagine. So, did it work? The spell."
6,21,JUDAH,"Well, uh, there was no mention of Cthulu in the morning papers, so... Actually, I do happen to have several letters detailing the dinner. (He walks to his bookshelf  and pulls out a file.) Worst thing that was reported was a hangover, so it's, uh - Got it - I've got them right here. Some - it's actually pretty interesting, um. (He opens the file, it's empty.) And, and they were... I'm sorry, they were right - they were right here."
6,21,BOBBY,"(stands up) Well, it's not like an invisible guy could just pop in and steal 'em, right?"
6,21,JUDAH,Right... right.
6,21,BOBBY,"So, uh, I'll leave you to it. And, um, you call me if you find 'em, huh?"
6,21,JUDAH,"Okay, hey. Thanks, thanks again for dropping by, huh?"
6,21,BOBBY,Lovecraft tried to jimmy a damn dimensional door. Idjit.
6,21,SAM,So what happened?
6,21,BOBBY,"Well, nothing much. Except, I dug, and every guest invited to the hoedown, dead or disappeared inside a year."
6,21,SAM,"Wow, um, so where are you off to now?"
6,21,BOBBY,Have a chat with one of the guests.
6,21,SAM,"Wait, didn't you just say that everyone there died?"
6,21,BOBBY,"Yeah, everybody Lovecraft invited died. Seems the maid had a nine year old boy. He was there."
6,21,SAM,"So, he'd be what, 83 years old now? Where is he?"
6,21,BOBBY,Same place he's been ever since the big night. Locked in a mental ward.
6,21,SAM,"(A fight can be heard inside the garage behind Sam) I see, um... Well, keep me posted, huh?"
6,21,BOBBY,"Okay, stay in touch. How's things going there? You got a lead on Lisa and Ben?"
6,21,SAM,"Well, um, we're making a few inquiries."
6,21,SAM,Slow going.
6,21,BOBBY,How's Dean?
6,21,SAM,About how you'd expect.
6,21,DEAN,Next customer.
6,21,DEMON,"Look, I don't know anything."
6,21,DEAN,"Yeah, we'll see."
6,21,SAM,Dean.
6,21,DEAN,Yeah? (Dean wipes the knife.)
6,21,SAM,"Look, man. You - you're running on what, uh, whisky and - and coffee and whatever else you're taking."
6,21,DEAN,"Yeah, and?"
6,21,SAM,"And we're grasping at straws here, man."
6,21,DEAN,"Look, I kill enough of these demons, eventually one of 'em's gonna tell me where Crowley is. So we good?"
6,21,SAM,"Well look, you've been at it for a while, why don't you at least let me take over? You deserve a break."
6,21,DEAN,No thanks. (Dean walks forward.)
6,21,SAM,Dean. (Sam grabs Dean's arm.)
6,21,DEAN,"Sam, back off. Lisa and Ben, wherever they are, that is a hundred percent on me. And if they are hurt... I'll yell if I need you."
6,21,SAM,"Castiel, it's Sam. Um, so look, I don't know if you're in on this whole Ben-Lisa thing, but if you have any heart whatsoever, bring 'em back to us, man. C'mon. Please. I'm begging you. I am begging you, do you understand? (Sam looks around. Nothing. He scoffs. As he walks away, Castiel is standing next to him, unseen.)"
6,21,CROWLEY,Sweetie. You look tense.
6,21,CASTIEL,You took Ben and Lisa.
6,21,CROWLEY,Oh. That.
6,21,CASTIEL,I told you -
6,21,CROWLEY,"Not to touch Sam and Dean. And I've respected that. I'm merely exploiting the obvious loophole. As long as I have the woman and boy, your fop-coiffed little heroes will be scouring the earth for them, therefore not you, and not me. Everybody wins."
6,21,CASTIEL,You should've talked to me first.
6,21,CROWLEY,I'd rather ask forgiveness than permission. (chuckles)
6,21,CASTIEL,"Where are they, Crowley?"
6,21,CROWLEY,(Makes a motion of zipping his lips and putting the key in his coat pocket.)
6,21,CASTIEL,"You are not to harm them, do you understand me?"
6,21,CROWLEY,You know what? You're all maxed out on putting humans out of bounds. I'll do with them as I please. Want to stop me? Go find freaking Purgatory!
6,21,CROWLEY,"Call on the bat-phone? Never call during business hours, do they?"
6,21,CASTIEL,I'll be back.
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"Cas, Cas, Cas. So good of you to come."
6,21,CASTIEL,Balthazar. Why'd you summon me here?
6,21,BALTHAZAR,Can I ask you a direct question?
6,21,CASTIEL,Of course.
6,21,BALTHAZAR,Are you in flagrante with the King of Hades?
6,21,CASTIEL,Of course not.
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"(laughs) Always were such a terrible liar. So it's true. Alright then, why?"
6,21,CASTIEL,"It's a means to an end. Balthazar, you understand that."
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"Oh, absolutely. But what's the end here exactly? You know, raid Purgatory, snatch up all the souls?"
6,21,CASTIEL,Win the war.
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"And I can only assume that you'd be the vessel, correct? Suck up all those souls into yourself? All that power?"
6,21,CASTIEL,It's the only way.
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"Or too much juice for you, in which case you explode, taking a substantial chunk of the planet along with you."
6,21,CASTIEL,That won't happen.
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"Sure, sure. Of course. (scoffs) Just - just tell me that it's entirely risk-free."
6,21,CASTIEL,"I'm sorry that I didn't tell you, but I need to know. Are you with me or not?"
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"(chuckles) Ah. You know, you may be certifiable, but fine. In for a penny, in for a pound."
6,21,CASTIEL,How'd you hear about this anyway?
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"Oh, your howler monkeys of course. See they're just a touch worked up about that kidnapping business, you know?"
6,21,WESTBOROUGH,"You sure you're not with that other reporter, in the coat? Liar, that one. Not who he says."
6,21,BOBBY,"No sir. Uh, I'm not affiliated with his paper. I just have a couple of questions about a dinner party you were at in 1937."
6,21,WESTBOROUGH,Everyone's so fascinated. Wanna know about my night at the home of the great H.P. Lovecraft.
6,21,BOBBY,If you don't mind.
6,21,WESTBOROUGH,"Well you know the story. They did their spell, and they all said it failed. (He looks around and leans in closer to Bobby.) Do you believe in monsters?"
6,21,BOBBY,Yep.
6,21,WESTBOROUGH,"You know, you go saying that, they'll lock you in here, rest of your life."
6,21,BOBBY,"Whatever you saw, you tell me and I'll buy it straight."
6,21,WESTBOROUGH,"The spell worked. A door opened and something came through. B - but it was invisible, so no one knew, except me."
6,21,BOBBY,How did you know then?
6,21,WESTBOROUGH,"Because it took my mother. It went into her. She wasn't the same. She even smelled different. And then, she disappeared. And surprise, surprise, one by one, they all start dying."
6,21,BOBBY,"I'm sorry, about your mom."
6,21,WESTBOROUGH,"You're the first person, ever said that. Hey, you wanna see a picture? Hmm?"
6,21,BOBBY,I'll be damned.
6,21,DEAN,"I promise you, pal. Start talking. (Dean walks over the devil's trap. Unknown to him, his shoe rubs away part of the devil's trap. The demon notices.) Or I swear, I will rip your skin off, strip by strip. And then I'm gonna kill you. (He leans in front of him.) And then I'm gonna do it to the next demon. You hear me?"
6,21,DEMON,Yeah. (His eyes go black.) I hear you.
6,21,DEMON,"So you can stop talking, you miserable sack."
6,21,DEAN,I didn't ask for your help.
6,21,CASTIEL,"Well, regardless, you're welcome."
6,21,DEAN,Why are you here? (Dean walks past Castiel.)
6,21,CASTIEL,I had no idea Crowley would take Lisa and Ben.
6,21,DEAN,(picking up the broken strap) Yeah right.
6,21,CASTIEL,You don't believe me.
6,21,DEAN,I don't believe a word that's coming out of your mouth.
6,21,CASTIEL,I thought you said that we were like family. Well I think that too. Shouldn't trust run both ways?
6,21,DEAN,"Cas, I just can't..."
6,21,CASTIEL,"Dean, I do everything that you ask. I always come when you call, and I am your friend. Still, despite your lack of faith in me, and now your threats, I just saved you, yet again. Has anyone but your closest kin ever done more for you? All I ask is this one thing."
6,21,DEAN,Trust your plan to pop Purgatory?
6,21,CASTIEL,"I've earned that, Dean."
6,21,DEAN,(scoffs)
6,21,CASTIEL,"I came to tell you that I will find Lisa and Ben, and I will bring them back. Stand behind me, the one time I ask."
6,21,DEAN,You're asking me to stand down?
6,21,CASTIEL,Dean.
6,21,DEAN,"That's the same damn ransom note that Crowley handed me. You know that, right? Well no thanks. I'll find 'em myself. In fact, why don't you go back to Crowley and tell him that I said you can both kiss my ass."
6,21,ELEANOR,(exhales sharply) Bobby?
6,21,BOBBY,Ellie. It's been a while.
6,21,ELEANOR,(exhales sharply) Come in.
6,21,ELEANOR,"So, how did you find me?"
6,21,BOBBY,"Well, we weren't together long, Ellie, but, uh, I know a thing or two about you. I know your safe houses. And let me tell you, this one ain't all that safe."
6,21,ELEANOR,"So, did you come here just to um, chat?"
6,21,BOBBY,"I know what you are, Ellie. (He pulls out the picture of young Westborough and his mom and hands it to her.) You're not exactly from Milwaukee, are you?"
6,21,ELEANOR,Not exactly. (She puts the picture down.)
6,21,BOBBY,"And, not that I'd have minded, but you kind of fibbed about your age too."
6,21,ELEANOR,(exhales sharply) Just slightly... 900 years.
6,21,BOBBY,"So what's your game, then?"
6,21,ELEANOR,Game?
6,21,BOBBY,"Yeah, why are you here? Eve came through and raised all kinds of hell quickly. You've been here how long, what's with the slow burn?"
6,21,ELEANOR,"Well, you know, we're not all alike."
6,21,BOBBY,Monsters?
6,21,ELEANOR,"Okay, if it makes you feel better to call me that? Fine."
6,21,BOBBY,You're from freaking Purgatory. You never thought to mention that the whole time you slept with me?
6,21,ELEANOR,"(scoffs) I am what I am, Bobby. And I happen to be a friend."
6,21,BOBBY,You wanna explain that to me?
6,21,ELEANOR,"I didn't ask those idiots to crack the door. I just happened to be the thing that fell through. And let me tell you something, you are lucky it was me."
6,21,BOBBY,You're saying you're on our side?
6,21,BOBBY,So you killed H.P. Lovecraft?
6,21,ELEANOR,"Please. That guy couldn't even write ""hello"". (She stands up.) Look, I have spent 75 years trying to keep Purgatory closed. Why do you think I gave Dean the sword? (Bobby sighs.) To stop Eve. Hell, you guys were supposed to kill the damn dragons."
6,21,BOBBY,"(stands up) Look, this all comes down to one angel. He wants Purgatory and he's looking for you."
6,21,ELEANOR,"Well, thanks for the heads-up."
6,21,BOBBY,"I know him, El. He's gonna figure it out. One way or another. Now, the only way I can stop him is to get ahead of him, so I need to know how you open the door."
6,21,ELEANOR,"No. No, Bobby, it's too dangerous for anyone to know."
6,21,BOBBY,"If I found you, he ain't far behind. At least let me take you somewhere, protect you."
6,21,ELEANOR,"No. Thanks. I have a couple of other places lined up. Don't worry. Bobby, you're just a man. I'm better off protecting myself."
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"Drinking your feelings, Sam? I thought that was your brother's bag."
6,21,SAM,Stressful times.
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"Well, we need to talk."
6,21,SAM,Why?
6,21,BALTHAZAR,Because - I know I'm gonna live to regret this - but I'm officially on your team. You bastards.
6,21,DEAN,And we should believe you why?
6,21,BALTHAZAR,Would you believe I had a shred of decency?
6,21,SAM,No.
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"Oh. That hurts. (Sam raises his eyebrows.) Okay, you're right. It's survival. You see, I asked Cas some questions and I disliked his answers. He seems awfully sure of himself for a man who wants to swallow a million nuclear reactors. I mean, these things can get a bit Chernobyl, you know? So, voilà. Consider me your double agent. Oh, and I took the liberty of searching for your friends. Uh, took a while. Crowley's a clever one."
6,21,DEAN,You found them?
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"Well, the upside is yes, uh, the downside is no, I can't get them for you."
6,21,SAM,Why not?
6,21,BALTHAZAR,Because Crowley's angel-proofed the whole bloody building. I guess he doesn't trust Cas. Seems that marriage is going swimmingly.
6,21,DEAN,"Okay, well get us as close as you can."
6,21,BALTHAZAR,Sure. But then you're on your own.
6,21,BALTHAZAR,"Alright, boys. This is where I get off. God be with you and what have you."
6,21,DEAN,"Alright, be careful."
6,21,LISA,"Oh, Dean. Thank God."
6,21,DEAN,"Still gotta get you out of here. (He grunts as he cuts Lisa free. She gets up.) Okay. Okay. (He grunts and cuts Ben free and starts to lead him away.) Alright, Ben, c'mon, let's go. Let's go."
6,21,DEMON!LISA,Brat's not going anywhere. And neither am I. (Her eyes go black.)
6,21,DEMON!LISA,"Crowley thought you might come, so he had me jump this hot little piece of ass for insurance. Can't go losing our leverage now, can we?"
6,21,DEMON!LISA,"Ah. Another step. Free appendectomy. (to Ben) You know she's awake in here, your mom. I can hear her thinking."
6,21,DEAN,"Don't listen to her, Ben."
6,21,DEMON!LISA,"(to Dean) What? I was just gonna tell him that you're his real daddy. (Dean stares.) (Demon!Lisa laughs.) Just kidding.  (to Ben) Who knows who your real dad is, kid? Your mom's a slut."
6,21,DEAN,You shut your mouth.
6,21,DEMON!LISA,"Oh what, you're her white knight now?  She wishes she never met you, Dean. You're the worst mistake she ever made. (to Ben)  Second worst, after keeping you."
6,21,DEAN,"It's not your mom, Ben. She's lying."
6,21,DEMON!LISA,"Says the C-minus lay with 10 miles of daddy issues. Whatever gets you through the night, Tiny Tim."
6,21,DEMON!LISA,"Uh uh. Back off, cowboy. (to Ben) You know she's begging me to kill you. She says you hold her back.  Never had a lick of fun since you were born."
6,21,DEAN,"Ben, look at me. Look at me. You're gonna be just fine. (Ben nods.) (Dean throws the holy water at Demon!Lisa, she screams and lets go of Ben.) Go! (Ben runs past Dean. Demon!Lisa goes after Dean with the knife. He pushes her against the wall. She drops the knife. Dean kicks it backwards.) Ben, knife! (Demon!Lisa pushes Dean. Ben picks up the knife.)"
6,21,DEMON!LISA,"What's the matter, Dean? Hit me! Oh, you don't wanna hurt poor Lisa. (laughs)"
6,21,DEAN,"Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus,"
6,21,DEMON!LISA,Shut your mouth. (She punches Dean in the face.)
6,21,DEAN,"Omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis congregatio et secta diabolica, (Demon!Lisa struggles to breathe) ergo draco maledicte,"
6,21,DEAN,Ecclesiam
6,21,DEMON!LISA,Stop it.
6,21,DEAN,Tuam
6,21,DEMON!LISA,I'm warning you.
6,21,DEAN,"You can go to hell, you black-eyed bitch."
6,21,DEMON!LISA,You sure about that? (She stabs herself in the stomach.)
6,21,BEN,Mom!
6,21,DEMON!LISA,(laughs) Exorcise me now. She's just a dead meatsuit. Now what was it you wanted to say?
6,21,DEAN,"(pauses and looks at Ben) Securi tibi facias libertate (Demon!Lisa starts to bleed from the mouth) servire te rogamus, audi nos."
6,21,BEN,Mom!
6,21,DEAN,Lisa!
6,21,DEAN,"Lisa. Here, put pressure on that, okay? (He gives her a cloth and puts her hand over the wound. She moans in pain.) I know, honey, I know. (He dials Sam.) That's it, it's okay."
6,21,DEAN,"Sam, where are you, dammit?! Alright, Ben, we gotta get her out of here, okay? Ben. Ben? (Ben is frozen with fear.) Ben. (Dean slaps him.) Hey! Listen to me, I need you to pull it together, okay? You gotta be strong. Your mom needs you right now. Go open that duffel bag, grab the salt gun. I gotta carry your mom out so if anything comes at us, you shoot it."
6,21,BEN,But -
6,21,DEAN,"Go, now!"
6,21,DEAN,"Okay. (to Ben) The knife. Get the knife. (They both make their way out the room.) Alright, Ben. Keep your elbow in, gun tight to your shoulder and watch for the kick. (A demon walks towards them.) Ben! (Ben shoots it.) Ben? Ben!"
6,21,BEN,Dean -
6,21,DEAN,"Come on, pull it together, do you want your mom to die? Let's go."
6,21,SAM,(From inside the room) Dean!
6,21,DEAN,Sam?
6,21,SAM,I'm in here!
6,21,DEAN,"Come one, we gotta get to a hospital. Ben, give the gun to him. Sam, we need a ride. (Dean picks Lisa up. Ben gives Sam the gun. They leave the building.)"
6,21,DEAN,"Go, go, go, go. (Ben and Dean - carrying Lisa - get in. Dean looks at Lisa's blood on his hand. Ben turns around, worried.)"
6,21,DEAN,"She's fine, Ben. She's fine. She's gonna be just fine. Almost there. (to Lisa.) Hey, hey. Stay with me. (to Sam) Sam, you gotta go faster, man! (to Lisa) You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be just fine."
6,21,DEAN,"Ben, I'm sorry."
6,21,DEAN,Ben.
6,21,CASTIEL,"Dean, listen."
6,21,DEAN,What do you want me to say? She'll be dead by midnight.
6,21,CASTIEL,I'm sorry.
6,21,DEAN,"I don't care. It's too little, too late."
6,21,CASTIEL,"Okay. Well, regardless, I didn't come for you."
6,21,DEAN,Meaning?
6,21,CASTIEL,"(he walks up to Lisa and places his hand on her forehead, healing her) She's fine now. She'll wake soon. Dean, I said I'm sorry and I meant it."
6,21,DEAN,Thank you. I wish this changed anything. (Dean is visibly upset.)
6,21,CASTIEL,"I know. So do I. All else aside, I just wanted to fix what I could."
6,21,DEAN,There's one more thing you could do for me.
6,21,BEN,"Hey, Mom."
6,21,LISA,Hey. What - ?
6,21,BEN,You're in the hospital.
6,21,LISA,What happened?
6,21,BEN,We were in a car crash.
6,21,LISA,Are you okay?
6,21,BEN,"Y - Yeah, I'm - I'm fine. You hit your head pretty bad, but you're okay now."
6,21,DEAN,Hi.
6,21,BEN,Who're you?
6,21,DEAN,"I, I'm Dean. Uh, I'm the guy who hit you."
6,21,LISA,Oh.
6,21,DEAN,"I just, uh, I lost control for a minute, and I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. I'm real happy you two are both okay. And uh, I'm just - I'm glad your life can get back to normal now."
6,21,LISA,"(smiles) We're okay, so - so that's what's important, right?"
6,21,DEAN,"Yeah. Anyway, uh, I'll leave you two alone. (to Ben) You take care of your mom."
6,21,SAM,Well?
6,21,DEAN,Well nothing. (He gets in the car.)
6,21,SAM,"(sighs)  Dean, you know, you've pulled some shady crap before, but this - (he shakes his head) - has got to be the worst. (he scoffs) Whitewashing their memories?  Take it from somebody who knows -"
6,21,DEAN,"If you ever mention Lisa and Ben to me again, I will break your nose."
6,21,SAM,Dean.
6,21,DEAN,I'm not kidding.
6,22,DEAN,(voiceover) Sam!
6,22,SAM,(voiceover) You got to promise not to try to bring me back.
6,22,DEAN,Sammy? (They hug.)
6,22,LISA,You're a hunter. And now you know your brother's out there. I need you to go.
6,22,CASTIEL,It's his soul. It's gone.
6,22,DEATH,I'm going to go to Hell to fetch your brother's soul. (He puts Sam's soul back in his chest. Sam screams.)
6,22,SAM,I don't remember anything.
6,22,CROWLEY,Finding Purgatory's important to me.
6,22,CROWLEY,"An untapped oil well of every fanged, clawed soul."
6,22,DEAN,That little limey mook roasted months ago.
6,22,EVE,Crowley's alive.
6,22,CROWLEY,I want to discuss a simple business transaction.
6,22,CASTIEL,With me?
6,22,CASTIEL,I can stop Raphael. You have to trust me.
6,22,ROBIN,"Hey, we're closed."
6,22,SAM,"Just uh, just give me a second. (He goes to the window.)"
6,22,ROBIN,"So pal, we - we open at noon."
6,22,SAM,"Look, you don't understand."
6,22,ROBIN,"Okay, I - I think I understand just fine. Look I - I don't need this kind of hassle. So seriously, just get the hell out."
6,22,SAM,"Please. Please, just give me a minute to think, that's all. Then I'm out of your hair. (Under the counter, Robin picks up a baseball bat.) One minute. Please. (Sam catches his breath.)"
6,22,ROBIN,(She sighs and puts the bat down.) What's your name?
6,22,SAM,I don't know.
6,22,ROBIN,What do you mean you don't know?
6,22,SAM,I mean I don't remember. I don't remember anything.
6,22,ROBIN,"Come on, you're dickin' with me. Nothing?"
6,22,SAM,I'm telling you. Blank slate. (He drinks.)
6,22,ROBIN,"Well, you got a wallet? ID?"
6,22,SAM,I wish I did.
6,22,ROBIN,"Okay, well what's the last thing you remember?"
6,22,SAM,"(shakes his head) Um, I woke up on a park bench, cops shoving a flashlight in my face, trying to take me in."
6,22,ROBIN,So you ran.
6,22,SAM,"No, I, um, I knocked 'em out cold. Both of 'em. No, look, I - I didn't mean to. It just happened really fast, you know I - I think instinct or something, I guess."
6,22,ROBIN,Some instinct.
6,22,SAM,"Yeah, tell me about it. I mean, who even knows how to do something like that?"
6,22,ROBIN,We'll get you to the ER. The - the quacks will hash it out.
6,22,SAM,No.
6,22,ROBIN,"Try ""yeah"". Look  the-the bats have flown the belfry, you need to see a doctor."
6,22,SAM,No. (Sam gets up.) I don't have time.
6,22,ROBIN,Time for what?
6,22,SAM,"(sighs) Look, it's hard to explain, I just feel like I - I have to be somewhere. There's something I gotta stop."
6,22,ROBIN,"Oh, like a wedding? A train?"
6,22,SAM,"No, something important. Something like life or death, like -"
6,22,ROBIN,"Okay, hey, hey, hey. Just relax, you know, you - you can't poop it out, so just... It'll come to you."
6,22,ROBIN,What is it? (He shows her the title.) You a horror fan?
6,22,SAM,"Yeah, um, I think so. I really think so. Something - something about this..."
6,22,ROBIN,"Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Seriously, we are taking you to a doctor."
6,22,SAM,Have you got a computer?
6,22,ROBIN,What?
6,22,SAM,"That's it. It exists. Look, two towns over. (He turns the laptop so that she can see.)"
6,22,ROBIN,"What, you think you're staying in this dump?"
6,22,SAM,Maybe.
6,22,ROBIN,"Oh, maybe you're a hooker."
6,22,SAM,(chuckles) I guess I'll find out.
6,22,ROBIN,Hmm.
6,22,SAM,"(sighs) Look, um, I don't know how to say, uh, thanks for everything."
6,22,ROBIN,Where do you think you're going?
6,22,SAM,I'll be fine.
6,22,ROBIN,"Says the headcase that just slumped over a minute ago. Look, is there any way I can convince you to go to a hospital?"
6,22,SAM,"No. Apparently, I'm stubborn."
6,22,ROBIN,Oh. So am I. (She gets her jacket.) I'm driving.
6,22,SAM,"Look, that's really nice of you, but not necessary."
6,22,ROBIN,"Really? Okay, look, your eggs are scrambled."
6,22,SAM,But -
6,22,ROBIN,But nothing.
6,22,SAM,"No, I mean I'm just some guy. I - I could be anybody. You gotta be nuts."
6,22,ROBIN,"I've been called that. Look, if I let you go off alone, I won't be able to sleep at night. And, honestly, I'm dying to know how it all turns out."
6,22,ROBIN,"So, uh, where do we start?"
6,22,SAM,"Uh, ground floor corner room, nearest to the fire escape. That's the one I'd pick, quickest getaway."
6,22,ROBIN,Any why do you know that?
6,22,SAM,(scoffs) I just do.
6,22,SAM,"Hey, you got a credit card?"
6,22,ROBIN,"Uh - (She gets her card.) Why, are we uh, checking in?"
6,22,SAM,Sort of. (He takes the card and picks the lock with it. The door opens. Robin takes her card back.)
6,22,SAM,Good question.
6,22,ROBIN,This all yours?
6,22,SAM,I don't know. I guess.
6,22,SAM,"(scoffs) You and me both. (He sighs and notices a newspaper article. The headline is ""SFU Professor Missing"". The picture is of Dr Eleanor Visyak. Sam gets another rush of memories. There is a flash of Dr Visyak. Sam collapses. He remembers something else.)"
6,22,DEAN,Where is she?
6,22,BOBBY,(shrugs) She said to meet her here. I'll try her again. (He takes out his cellphone and dials. They hear Eleanor's phone ringing from nearby. It's on the ground next to a dumpster. They hurry to it and find Eleanor sitting on he ground against the dumpster. She's hurt. Bobby kneels in front of her. Sam and Dean stand behind him.)
6,22,BOBBY,El?
6,22,ELEANOR,Hey. I guess I could've used your help after all.
6,22,BOBBY,Just be still.
6,22,SAM,What happened?
6,22,ELEANOR,They took me. I got away.
6,22,BOBBY,"Oh, Ellie. What have they done to you?"
6,22,ELEANOR,"(chuckles) Everything. The demon I could've handled, but when the angel stepped in, I - (sighs) I told him, Bobby. They have enough to crack Purgatory wide open."
6,22,BOBBY,Tell me. I need to know.
6,22,ELEANOR,"They need virgin blood. That's a milk-run for them. And they need the blood of a Purgatory native, and well, they've got plenty of that now."
6,22,DEAN,Have they opened it yet?
6,22,ELEANOR,"(she shakes her head) Tomorrow. The moon - an eclipse. I'm sorry, Bobby."
6,22,BOBBY,"No, it's okay. It's okay."
6,22,ELEANOR,"I'm sorry, really sorr-"
6,22,BOBBY,Tell us where they are.
6,22,BOBBY,El?
6,22,CASTIEL,I'm sorry this had to happen. (Bobby stands up.) Crowley got carried away.
6,22,BOBBY,"Yeah, I bet it was all Crowley you son of a bitch! (He tries to go after Castiel but Sam and Dean restrain him and he steps back.)"
6,22,DEAN,"(to Castiel) You don't even see it, do you? How totally off the rails you are!"
6,22,DEAN,"Well, good, 'cause I think you already know the answer."
6,22,DEAN,Save Sam from what?
6,22,ROBIN,"Hey, hey. Are you okay?"
6,22,SAM,Sam. My name is Sam.
6,22,ROBIN,"So, uh, what do you remember?"
6,22,SAM,Well. (chuckles) It might sound pretty strange if I said it aloud. (He dries his face with a towel.)
6,22,ROBIN,"Oh, it - it couldn't get any stranger."
6,22,SAM,"(He throws the towel down.) Yeah. Don't be so sure. (sighs & shrugs) Look, I - I don't know, I mean it's all pretty spotty, you know? I just remember I was, I was with, uh - with two guys. One was a - like a male model type and the other was an older guy named, uh, Bobby. (He picks up an address book and leafs through it.)"
6,22,ROBIN,Okay. W- What are you looking for?
6,22,SAM,Here. Bobby Singer. That has to be it.
6,22,ROBIN,Is there a phone number?
6,22,SAM,"No, just an address. Sioux Falls, South Dakota. (scoffs)"
6,22,ROBIN,"South Dakota. Okay, uh, l-listen, Sam. Sam, right?"
6,22,SAM,Yeah.
6,22,ROBIN,"Look, I'm really sorry, but this is - is where I gotta get off."
6,22,SAM,"Oh, no, of course. No problem."
6,22,ROBIN,"Okay. Well, how are you gonna get there?"
6,22,SAM,(Sam sees a set of car keys on the table and picks them up.) I guess I'll take my car.
6,22,SAM,That's mine.
6,22,ROBIN,Are you sure?
6,22,SAM,Oh yeah.
6,22,ROBIN,"Look, Sam I don't feel right about you going off like this."
6,22,SAM,"Oh, look, don't worry. Y-you've done way to much for me already."
6,22,ROBIN,"That's not what I mean. What I mean is uh... I've got a bad feeling you know, with those IDs and that shady-ass hotel room. Whatever you're looking for, you might not like what you find."
6,22,SAM,(scoffs) What other choice do I have?
6,22,ROBIN,"You could stick around here a little bit longer, I mean get your head straight, instead of going off, flying blind into..."
6,22,ROBIN,(gasps) What the hell was that?
6,22,SAM,Stay down. (He gets up and looks at the shooter. The shooter looks exactly like Sam.)
6,22,ROBIN,Sam! Sammy!
6,22,DEAN,"Sammy? Come on, snap out of it."
6,22,BOBBY,Anything?
6,22,DEAN,"I can't just sit here, Bobby. I've got to help him."
6,22,BOBBY,Dean.
6,22,DEAN,"You know, dreamscape his noggin. Something."
6,22,BOBBY,"You know what Cas did. The dam inside your brother's head is gone, and all hell's spilling loose. We don't what's going on inside."
6,22,DEAN,I don't care. We have got to do something!
6,22,BOBBY,"And we will, but right now we got sixteen hours 'til they pop Purgatory. I'm down one man. I can't afford to be down two."
6,22,DEAN,"Yeah, and how's that going, huh? We've got no line on Crowley. We got no line on Cas. Balthazar's MIA. I mean, all we've got is Sam, going through whatever the hell this is!"
6,22,BOBBY,"You know, (he turns a glass over and pours a drink) this is exactly what Cas wants. For you to fall to pieces. Just try to think of what Sam would want. (He holds out the drink. Dean pauses before taking it.)"
6,22,DEAN,"Find Cas, Bobby. Find him now."
6,22,SAM,(sniffs) Do you smell whisky?
6,22,ROBIN,"Okay, Sam, would you focus?"
6,22,SAM,Yeah. Sorry.
6,22,ROBIN,"Okay, so, who shot at us?"
6,22,SAM,I - I didn't really get a good look.
6,22,ROBIN,"Okay, we gotta go to the cops."
6,22,SAM,"No, look, if we can just get to my friends, they can help us. I know it."
6,22,ROBIN,"Okay, you don't know if they're your friends, okay, you don't know anything about anything! Just turn around."
6,22,ROBIN,How do you know that? You're scaring me.
6,22,SAM,What? No way. (He gets out the car. Robin follows.)
6,22,SAM,What do you mean? It's daylight.
6,22,ROBIN,Yeah.
6,22,SAM,"It was night, and now it's day."
6,22,SAM,"No, no, no, no, no. No, it wasn't. It... What the hell is going on here?"
6,22,ROBIN,"Okay, so I am all filled up on crazy for today. You know what, Sam? I'll - I'll see ya. (She starts to walk away.)"
6,22,SAM,"Wait, wait. Wait. Hey, hey, hey."
6,22,SAM,"Get in the car. (He gestures to the woods with his head. She hears his urgency and complies. Sam exhales deeply. He opens the boot of the car, seeing all the weapons.) Wow. (He props the boot up with a shotgun and takes a pistol. He cocks it, puts it back and instead takes another shotgun. He cocks it and closes the boot. In the car, Robin sighs nervously.)"
6,22,SOULLESS!SAM,My God. Am I really that gawky? (He throws the shotgun on the ground.) Howdy.
6,22,SAM,(shocked) This is impossible.
6,22,SOULLESS!SAM,Cold. Try again.
6,22,SAM,I'm uh- I'm hallucinating.
6,22,SOULLESS!SAM,"Warmer. But see, normally, you're awake when you're tripping balls."
6,22,SAM,I'm dreaming?
6,22,SOULLESS!SAM,"And someone just won a copy of the home game. We're inside your grapefruit, Sam. Son, you've been juiced."
6,22,SAM,I-I don't remember anything.
6,22,SOULLESS!SAM,"Well, your BFF Cas brought the Hell-wall tumbling down and you, pathetic infant that you are, shattered into pieces. (he points at Sam) Piece. (he points at himself) Piece."
6,22,SAM,I - I have no idea what you're talking about.
6,22,SOULLESS!SAM,"Why would you? You're jello, pal. Unlike me."
6,22,SOULLESS!SAM,"I'm not handicapped. I'm not saddled with a soul. In fact, I used to skipper this meatboat for a while. It was smooth sailing. I was sharp, strong. That is, 'til they crammed your soul back in. Now look at you. Same misty-eyed milksop you always were. That's because souls are weak. They're a liability. Now, nothing personal, but run the numbers. Someone's got to take charge around here, before it's too late. (He cocks his gun. Sam runs. He shoots after Sam but misses.)"
6,22,SOULLESS!SAM,"(echoing) Come out, come out, wherever you are."
6,22,SAM,I remember who I am. Everything I did this past year. And I remember you.
6,22,ROBIN,"Didn't I tell you to turn back, that you wouldn't like what you found?"
6,22,SAM,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
6,22,ROBIN,Not as sorry as you're gonna be. (She disappears.)
6,22,BOBBY,Look what the cat dragged in.
6,22,BALTHAZAR,"Well, at least you mudfish finally got the angel-proofing right. (he points to Sam) How's Sleeping Beauty? You didn't steal any kisses, I trust?"
6,22,DEAN,What the hell took you so long? (He walks up to Balthazar. Bobby stands a step behind Dean.)
6,22,BALTHAZAR,Honestly? I was having second thoughts.
6,22,DEAN,About?
6,22,BALTHAZAR,About whether to help you. I was thinking maybe... Maybe I should rip out your sticky bits instead.
6,22,BOBBY,And what did you decide?
6,22,BALTHAZAR,Well... (He pulls out a piece of paper and hands it to Dean.) Cas and Crowley are there. That's where the show gets started.
6,22,DEAN,"Alright, well give us a minute to pack up and then zap us there."
6,22,BALTHAZAR,"Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't think so."
6,22,DEAN,Balthazar.
6,22,BALTHAZAR,I'm betraying a friend here. A very powerful friend. We all are. So I think I've stuck my neck out far enough already. Good luck. (He disappears.)
6,22,CROWLEY,"Your Purgatory power-shake, Monsieur. (He gives it to Castiel.) Half monster, half virgin."
6,22,CASTIEL,Thank you.
6,22,CROWLEY,You seem even more constipated than usual. Maybe get you some Colonblow?
6,22,CASTIEL,I'm renegotiating our terms.
6,22,CROWLEY,Is that so? What terms do you propose?
6,22,CASTIEL,You get nothing. Not one single soul.
6,22,CROWLEY,"Can't help notice, seems a bit unfairly weighted. (Castiel doesn't answer.) Castiel. You wouldn't dare. I brought you this deal."
6,22,CASTIEL,You think I'm handing all that power to the king of Hell? I'm neither stupid nor wicked.
6,22,CROWLEY,Unbelievable. Have you forgotten that you're the bottom in this relationship?
6,22,CASTIEL,"Here are your options. You either flee, or you die."
6,22,CASTIEL,"Flee, or die."
6,22,CROWLEY,"(scoffs) Boy, just can't trust anyone these days. (Crowley disappears.)"
6,22,SAM,Hey. Hey!
6,22,TORTURED!SAM,"(his voice is weak) Oh. Hi, Sam."
6,22,SAM,"So, which one are you?"
6,22,TORTURED!SAM,Don't you know? (He stands up. His face is bruised.) I'm the one that remembers Hell.
6,22,BOBBY,"Time's up, Dean."
6,22,DEAN,"Yeah, just a second."
6,22,DEAN,"Alright, this is where we're gonna be, Sam. You get your lazy ass out of bed and come and meet us. Sammy, please."
6,22,TORTURED!SAM,"I wish you hadn't come, Sam."
6,22,SAM,"I had to. I'm here, right? Out there in the real world, I'm at Bobby's, aren't I?"
6,22,TORTURED!SAM,How do you know?
6,22,SAM,"This whole time, I've smelt nothing but Old Spice and whisky. Figured if I could get back here, back to my body, I could... I don't know, I could snap out of it somehow."
6,22,TORTURED!SAM,But first you have to go through me.
6,22,SAM,Why?
6,22,TORTURED!SAM,"Humpty Dumpty has to put himself back together again, before he can wake up. And I'm the last piece."
6,22,SAM,"Which means, (Sam lowers his gun and steps closer) I have to know what you know. What happened in the cage?"
6,22,TORTURED!SAM,"Trust me, you don't wanna know it."
6,22,SAM,You're right. But I still have to.
6,22,TORTURED!SAM,"Sam, you can't imagine. Stay here, go back, find that bartender, go find Jess, but don't do this. I know you. You're not strong enough."
6,22,SAM,(exhales) We'll just have to see.
6,22,TORTURED!SAM,(scoffs) Why is this so important to you?
6,22,SAM,You know me. You know why. I'm not leaving my brother alone out there.
6,22,TORTURED!SAM,"I'm not gonna fight you. (He holds out the knife, handle first.) But this is your last chance."
6,22,TORTURED!SAM,Good luck. You're gonna need it.
6,22,BALTHAZAR,"You rang, Cas?"
6,22,CASTIEL,Yeah. We have a problem. Dean Winchester is on his way here.
6,22,BALTHAZAR,Really? Oh. How'd he even know where we were?
6,22,CASTIEL,(he puts the jar down) Apparently we have a Judas in our midst.
6,22,BALTHAZAR,"Ah. (chuckles) Holy hell. Who is it? I bet it's that bloody little Cherub, isn't it?"
6,22,CASTIEL,(stands up) I don't know. But I - I need you to find out.
6,22,BALTHAZAR,"Of course. Um, right away. Right away. Uh, but what do you want me to do about Dean?"
6,22,CASTIEL,(turns away) Nothing. I'll handle him myself.
6,22,BALTHAZAR,Castiel? Are you alright?
6,22,CASTIEL,"First Sam and Dean, and now this. I'm doing my best in impossible circumstances. My friends, they abandon me, plot against me. It's difficult to understand."
6,22,BALTHAZAR,Well you've - you've always got little old me.
6,22,CASTIEL,"Yes, I'll always have you."
6,22,BALTHAZAR,Cas...
6,22,BOBBY,"I count a dozen mooks, probably more."
6,22,DEAN,Demons?
6,22,BOBBY,Angels.
6,22,DEAN,Well how the hell are we gonna take out that many angels?
6,22,BOBBY,We don't. We'll ninja our way in.
6,22,DEAN,"Awesome. Yeah, 'til they hear your knee squeak."
6,22,BOBBY,Shut up.
6,22,DEAN,"Oh, what, now you got thin skin?"
6,22,BOBBY,"No, shut up. You hear that?"
6,22,DEAN,What the hell is that? (He sees ripples in a puddle from the vibrations.) T-Rex maybe?
6,22,BOBBY,Holy mother of -
6,22,DEAN,Get in the car! Get in the car!
6,22,CROWLEY,"Never underestimate the king of Hell, darling. I know a lot of swell tricks. Now, I think it's time to re-renegotiate our terms."
6,22,CROWLEY,"Sweaty hands, mate."
6,22,CASTIEL,I don't understand.
6,22,CROWLEY,"You can palm me all you want. I'm safe and sound under the wing of my new partner. (He gestures to the right, where Raphael appears, in a female vessel.)"
6,22,RAPHAEL,"Hello, Castiel."
6,22,CASTIEL,Raphael.
6,22,CASTIEL,Consorting with demons. I thought that was beneath you.
6,22,CROWLEY,"You know, Castiel y-you've said all sorts of shameful, appalling, scatological things about Raphael. I-I've found him, her, to be really quite reasonable."
6,22,CASTIEL,You fool. Raphael will deceive and destroy you at the speed of thought.
6,22,CROWLEY,"Right, right, 'cause you're such a straight shooter. She, he, has offered me protection against all comers."
6,22,CASTIEL,In exchange for what?
6,22,CROWLEY,The Purgatory blood.
6,22,CASTIEL,"He's gonna bring the Apocalypse, and worse."
6,22,CROWLEY,"Hey, this is your doing, mate. I'm merely grabbing the best offer on the table. Now, you have two options. (in a deep, mocking voice) Flee, or die."
6,22,CROWLEY,"Ianua magna Purgatorii, clausa est ob nos,
lumine eius ab oculis nostris retento."
6,22,CROWLEY,"Sed nunc stamus ad limen huius ianuae magnae et demisse, fideliter, perhonorifice, paramus aperire eam. Creaturae terrificae,"
6,22,CROWLEY,"quarum ungulae et dentes, nunquam tetigerunt
carnem humanam."
6,22,CROWLEY,"Bit busy, gentlemen. Be with you in a moment."
6,22,CROWLEY,"Aperit fauces eius ad mundum nostrum, nunc, ianua magna aperta tandem!"
6,22,CROWLEY,Mm-hmmm. Maybe I said it wrong.
6,22,CASTIEL,You said it perfectly. All you needed was this. (He puts the jar down. Dean & Bobby get up.)
6,22,CROWLEY,I see. (He walks to the wall and touches the blood.) And we've been working with... (he tastes it) Dog blood. Naturally.
6,22,RAPHAEL,"Enough of these games, Castiel. Give us the blood."
6,22,CROWLEY,"You- Game's over. His jar's empty. So, Castiel, how'd your ritual go? Better than ours, I'll bet."
6,22,CASTIEL,You can't imagine what it's like. They're all inside me. Millions upon millions of souls.
6,22,CROWLEY,Sounds sexy. Exit stage Crowley. (He disappears.)
6,22,CASTIEL,"Now, what's the matter, Raphael? Somebody clip your wings?"
6,22,RAPHAEL,"Castiel, please. You let the demon go, but not your own brother?"
6,22,CASTIEL,"The demon I have plans for. You on the other hand...  (Castiel snaps his fingers; Raphael explodes. The angel blade Raphael had been holding falls to the ground.) So, you see, I saved you."
6,22,DEAN,"Sure thing, Cas. Thank you."
6,22,CASTIEL,"You doubted me, fought against me, but I was right all along."
6,22,DEAN,"Okay, Cas, you were. We're sorry. Now let's just defuse you, okay?"
6,22,CASTIEL,What do you mean?
6,22,DEAN,"You're full of nuke. It's not safe. So, before the eclipse ends, let's get them souls back to where they belong."
6,22,CASTIEL,"Oh no, they belong with me."
6,22,DEAN,"No, Cas, it's it-it's scrambling your brain."
6,22,CASTIEL,"No, I'm not finished yet. Raphael had many followers, and I must punish them all severely."
6,22,DEAN,"Listen to me. Listen, I know there's a lot of bad water under the bridge, but we were family once. I'd have died for you. I almost did a few times. So if that means anything to you... Please. I've lost Lisa, I've lost Ben, and now I've lost Sam. Don't make me lose you too. You don't need this kind of juice anymore, Cas. Get rid of it before it kills us all."
6,22,CASTIEL,"You're just saying that because I won. Because you're afraid. (Behind him, Sam picks up the angel blade.) You're not my family, Dean. I have no family."
6,22,CASTIEL,"I'm glad you made it, Sam. But the angel blade won't work, because I'm not an angel anymore. I'm your new God. A better one. So you will bow down and profess your love unto me, your Lord. Or I shall destroy you."
7,1,SAM:,"I let Lucifer out, I gotta put him back in."
7,1,SAMIFER:,Sammy's long gone.
7,1,CASTIEL:,It's his soul. It's gone.
7,1,DEATH:,"I can't erase Sam's Hell, but I can put it behind a wall."
7,1,DEATH:,"Keep digging, Dean."
7,1,DEAN:,"Are you just going to be cryptic, or..."
7,1,DEATH:,It's about the souls.
7,1,CASTIEL:,I will save Sam. But only if you stand down.
7,1,DEAN:,What happened to you Cas?
7,1,CASTIEL:,I'm at war.
7,1,CROWLEY:,"I want to discuss a simple business transaction, that's all."
7,1,CASTIEL:,You want to make a deal? With me?
7,1,CROWLEY:,It's the souls.
7,1,CASTIEL:,They're all inside me. Millions upon millions of souls.
7,1,CASTIEL:,"The angel blade won't work, because I'm not an angel anymore. I'm your new god. You will bow down and profess your love unto me, your Lord, or I shall destroy you."
7,1,BOBBY:,"Well, all right then. Is this good, or you want the whole ""forehead to the carpet"" thing?"
7,1,CASTIEL:,"Stop. What's the point if you don't mean it? You fear me. Not love, not respect, just fear."
7,1,SAM:,Cas...
7,1,CASTIEL:,"Sam, you have nothing to say to me; you stabbed me in the back. (to BOBBY and DEAN): Get up."
7,1,DEAN:,"Cas, come on, this isn't you."
7,1,CASTIEL:,The Castiel you knew is gone.
7,1,DEAN:,"So what, then? Kill us?"
7,1,CASTIEL:,"What a brave little ant you are. You know you're powerless, you wouldn't dare move against me again. That would be pointless. So I have no need to kill you. Not now. Besides...once you were my favorite pets before you turned and bit me."
7,1,DEAN:,Who are you?
7,1,CASTIEL:,"I'm God. And if you stay in your place, you may live in my kingdom. If you rise up, I will strike you down. Not doing so well, are you Sam?"
7,1,SAM:,I'm fine...(clears throat)...I'm...fine.
7,1,DEAN:,You said you would fix him - you promised!
7,1,CASTIEL:,"IF you stood down, which you hardly did. Be thankful for my mercy. I could have cast you back into the pit."
7,1,DEAN:,"Cas, come on, this is nuts! You can turn this around, please!"
7,1,CASTIEL:,I hope for your sake this is the last you see me.
7,1,DEAN:,"Sam, you okay?"
7,1,CASTIEL:,"Understand. If you followed Raphael, if you stood against me, punishment is certain; there is nowhere to hide. The rest of you, our Father left a long time ago, and that was hard. I thought the answer was free will. But I understand now. You need a firm hand. You need a father. And I am your father now. Be obedient, children. Or this will be your fate."
7,1,CASTIEL:,"It is a new day. On earth, and in heaven. Rejoice."
7,1,DEAN:,"(Grunts) Come on. (grunts) (the sound of groaning metal is heard as he tries to push the dented roof out with his feet). Come on, baby!"
7,1,BOBBY:,"So, you fixin' her or primal screamin'?"
7,1,DEAN:,"Ah, thanks. How's Sam?"
7,1,BOBBY:,He's still under. But alive.
7,1,DEAN:,Yeah? What about God part deux?
7,1,BOBBY:,"I got all kinds of feelers out, so far diddly."
7,1,DEAN:,And what exactly are you looking for?
7,1,BOBBY:,"Exactly. What? Miracles, mass visions, trenchcoat on a tortilla? I don't know what I'm lookin' for."
7,1,DEAN:,"Ah, well, he'll surface."
7,1,BOBBY:,"So say we do suss out where ""new and improved"" flew off to..."""
7,1,DEAN:,Yeah?
7,1,BOBBY:,The hell we plan to do about it?
7,1,DEAN:,"I don't know, Bobby, I got no more clue than you do."
7,1,BOBBY:,"I don't even know what books to hit for this, Dean."
7,1,DEAN:,"Well, figure it out! I'm sorry. This ain't in no book. If you stick your neck out, Cas steps on it. So you know what I'm gonna do?"
7,1,BOBBY:,What?
7,1,DEAN:,"Imma fix this car. Because that's what I can do. I can work on her 'til she's mint. And when Sam wakes up, no matter what shape he's in, we'll glue him back together too. We owe him that."
7,1,BOBBY:,I'm with you.
7,1,SAM:,Hey Dean.
7,1,DEAN:,"Ah, you're walking and talking."
7,1,SAM:,"Yeah. I, uh, put on my own socks, the whole nine."
7,1,DEAN:,"Well, that's uh... I mean you, uh, you sure you're okay?"
7,1,SAM:,"Yeah. My head hurts a little, but...basically."
7,1,DEAN:,Seriously?
7,1,SAM:,"Look man, I'm as surprised as you are but, yeah, I swear."
7,1,DEAN:,"Good! No reason putting a gift horse under a microscope, right?"
7,1,SAM:,Yeah. So what happened with Cas?
7,1,DEAN:,"Why don't you come help me with the car, I'll fill you in?"
7,1,SAM:,Okay.
7,1,DEAN,leaves through the back door. SAM starts to follow him but hesitates as he hears the faint sound of chains jingling. He nervously looks around but seems to see nothing out of order.
7,1,REVEREND:,"Plenty speak for them and their so-called lifestyle. Media, Hollywood, Lady Gaga won't shut up for love or money."
7,1,REVEREND:,"Yeah, funny, but that's why we raise our voices! And picket their so-called weddings, and their funerals. Someone has to speak for God."
7,1,CASTIEL (O.S.):,And who says you speak for God?
7,1,CASTIEL:,"You're wrong, I am utterly indifferent to sexual orientation. On the other hand, I cannot abide hypocrites like you, Reverend."
7,1,REVEREND:,"Okay, fun's over friend."
7,1,CASTIEL:,Tell your flock where your genitals have been before you speak for me.
7,1,REVEREND:,And who the heck are you?
7,1,CASTIEL:,I'm God.
7,1,CASTIEL:,"And he who lies in my name shall choke on his own false tongue, and his poisonous words shall betray him."
7,1,VOICE:,Castiel...
7,1,VOICE:,Cas!
7,1,EVIL VOICE:,Ha ha ha ha ha!
7,1,SAM:,"No, no, this can't be happening."
7,1,BOBBY (O.S.):,"Hey Sam! What are you, taking a nap down here?"
7,1,BOBBY:,"It's Cas, we think. Come on."
7,1,SAM:,Yeah. Coming.
7,1,DEAN,Can't argue with that one.
7,1,SAM:,Motivational speakers?
7,1,DEAN:,"Yeah, I'm not sure new Cas gets irony any better than old Cas. Of course, old Cas wouldn't smite Madison Square Garden just to prove a point. He is off the deep end of the deep end. And there's no slowing down."
7,1,SAM:,"So, what? Try to talk to him again?"
7,1,DEAN:,Sam.
7,1,SAM:,"Dean, all we can do is talk to the guy."
7,1,DEAN:,"He's not a guy. He's God. And he's pissed. And when God gets righteous, you get the hell out of the way; haven't you read the Bible?"
7,1,SAM:,I guess...
7,1,DEAN:,"Cas is never coming back. He's lied to us, he used us, he cracked your gourd like it was nothing. No more talk; we have spent enough on him."
7,1,SAM:,Okay.
7,1,DEAN:,Hand me that socket wrench.
7,1,CROWLEY:,"Educate me, Lewinsky."
7,1,CASTIEL (O.S.):,"Hello, Crowley."
7,1,CASTIEL:,You look stressed.
7,1,CROWLEY:,Bollocks.
7,1,CROWLEY:,"So, the jig is up. You found me."
7,1,CASTIEL:,I never lost you.
7,1,CASTIEL:,"These scratches, they're all useless."
7,1,CROWLEY:,Still.. Can't blame a girl for trying.
7,1,CROWLEY:,Fancy a drink before you smite me?
7,1,CASTIEL:,No.
7,1,CROWLEY:,"You like to bend them right over, do you? Let's go."
7,1,CASTIEL:,"I'm not going to kill you, Crowley. I have plans for you."
7,1,CROWLEY:,What's it?
7,1,CASTIEL:,"Here's our new arrangement; I let you live, you return to your post as king of hell."
7,1,CROWLEY:,but?
7,1,CASTIEL:,"I choose where each soul goes. I control the flow, and you take whatever I give you."
7,1,CROWLEY:,"I take it you intend to keep the live share? So, what you're saying is hell's being downsized?"
7,1,CASTIEL:,"I would have done away with it completely, but I need a threat to hold over my enemies, and we need to keep Michael and Lucifer's cage."
7,1,CROWLEY:,"Right. I gather this is not a, uh, negotiation."
7,1,CASTIEL:,No.
7,1,CROWLEY:,"Then I graciously accept, boss."
7,1,CASTIEL:,I'll be in touch.
7,1,SAM:,Dean... Bobby?
7,1,BOBBY:,She's looking good.. Considering.
7,1,DEAN:,Considering? I should do this professionally.
7,1,BOBBY:,So.. Seen Sam lately?
7,1,DEAN:,"Yeah, why?"
7,1,DEAN:,"What? Well, spit it out."
7,1,BOBBY:,"How is that kid even vertical? I mean, Cas broke his damn pinata."
7,1,DEAN:,I know.
7,1,BOBBY:,"I mean, I get how he came to help us back at the lab. Adrenaline. Sure, but now?"
7,1,DEAN:,Well.. he says he's okay.
7,1,BOBBY:,How?
7,1,DEAN:,I don't know. I just pray to God it's true.
7,1,BOBBY:,We need to come up with a new saying for that.
7,1,DEAN:,"Seriously though, Bobby. Look at our lives. How many more hits can we take? So, if Sam says he's good.. GOOD."
7,1,BOBBY:,You believe that?
7,1,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,1,DEAN:,No. You wanna know why? because we never catch a break. So why would we this time? I just.. just this one thing. You know? but I'm not dumb. I'm not going to get my hopes up just to get kicked in the daddy-pills again.
7,1,SAM:,Hey.
7,1,BOBBY:,"Hey. How are you feeling, sport?"
7,1,SAM:,Can't complain!
7,1,DEAN:,Great. What's the word?
7,1,SAM:,"Well, a publishing house literally exploded about an hour ago. The guy has a body count that's really getting up there. We gotta do something."
7,1,BOBBY:,"What we've got to do is hunt the son of bitch. Unfortunately, I lost my God guns."
7,1,SAM:,"Well, I mean is there some kind of heavenly weapon? Maybe something out of that angel arsenal that Balthazar stole? There has to be something that can hurt him."
7,1,DEAN:,"He's God, Sam. There's nothing, but there might be someone."
7,1,CROWLEY:,No. No! NO! Come on!
7,1,BOBBY:,Don't act so surprised.
7,1,CROWLEY:,My new boss is going to kill me for even talking to you lads.
7,1,DEAN:,"Well, you're lucky we're not stabbing you in your scuzzy face, you little piece.."
7,1,SAM:,"Whoa, wait! What new boss?"
7,1,CROWLEY:,"Castiel, you giraffe."
7,1,BOBBY:,Is your boss?
7,1,CROWLEY:,"Is everybody's boss. What do you think he's going to do if he finds out we've been conspiring? You do you want to conspire, don't you?"
7,1,BOBBY:,No. We want you to just stand there and look pretty.
7,1,CROWLEY:,Listening.
7,1,DEAN:,We need a spell to bind Death.
7,1,CROWLEY:,Bind? Enslave Death? You having a laugh?
7,1,DEAN:,Lucifer did it.
7,1,CROWLEY:,That's Lucifer.
7,1,SAM:,A spell's a spell.
7,1,CROWLEY:,You really believe you can handle that kind of horsepower? You're delusional!
7,1,DEAN:,Death is the only player on the board left that has the kind of juice to take Cas.
7,1,CROWLEY:,They'll both mash us like peas. Why should I help with a suicide mission?
7,1,BOBBY:,Look! Do you really want Cas running the universe?
7,1,HOMELESS MAN:,"Some help, please. Please. Help. So helpless."
7,1,HOMELESS MAN:,"God bless you, Sir."
7,1,CASTIEL:,"You're a true believer. People say I'm wrathful, but I only punish liars and those who forsake me. I am a just God."
7,1,HOMELESS MAN:,Excuse me?
7,1,CASTIEL:,See.
7,1,HOMELESS MAN:,"Oh my God, I can see!"
7,1,HOMELESS MAN:,Your face.. What's wrong with you?
7,1,CREEPY VOICE:,A mistake. Too late. Let us out.
7,1,CREEPY VOICE:,Let us out. Let us out!
7,1,CASTIEL:,No.
7,1,BOBBY:,Hello?
7,1,BOBBY:,It's from Crowley.
7,1,DEAN:,"Well, Who feels like hog tying death tonight?"
7,1,BOBBY:,Old age is over-rated anyhow.
7,1,BOBBY:,"Well, we've got most of this stuff, but we're going to have to make a run for a few things."
7,1,DEAN:,Like?
7,1,BOBBY:,Like an act of God crystallised forever.
7,1,SAM:,What's that supposed to mean?
7,1,BOBBY:,"I think it means an actual crystal. See, lightning strikes sand at the right angle - it crystallises into the perfect shape of itself."
7,1,SAM:,Lightning. Act of God.
7,1,BOBBY:,Jinga. You got yourself a fulgurate and we're gonna need a biggie.
7,1,DEAN:,And let me guess... rare.
7,1,BOBBY:,I found records of an auction. Winning bidder lives about nine hours from here.
7,1,SECURITY GUARD:,Hey!
7,1,DEAN:,Excuse me. You got any Grey Poupon?
7,1,SAM:,Grey Poupon? Seriously?
7,1,DEAN:,It's what popped in my head.
7,1,DEAN:,Hi. Uh... I don't want to hurt you. Really.
7,1,DR. WEISS:,"I'm the one with the firearm, son."
7,1,DEAN:,I get that.
7,1,DEAN:,"Okay. Yeah. Good. Hey, guys. Uh, so this is Dr. and Mrs. Weiss."
7,1,SAM:,Hi. Sorry.
7,1,DEAN:,I found the God thingy.
7,1,BOBBY:,"Well, let's light this candle."
7,1,DEAN:,You're welcome.
7,1,BOBBY:,"Te nunc invoco, mortem. Te in mea potestate defixi. Nunc et in aeternum!"
7,1,DEAN:,Um... Hello? Death?
7,1,DEATH:,You're joking.
7,1,DEAN:,"I'm sorry, Death. This isn't what it seems."
7,1,DEATH:,Seems like you bound me.
7,1,DEAN:,"For good reason, okay? Just, uh, hear us out. Um... Fried pickle chip? They're the best in the state."
7,1,DEATH:,"That easy to soothe me, you think? This is about Sam's hallucinations, I assume?"
7,1,DEAN:,What?
7,1,DEATH:,"Sorry, Sam. One wall per customer. Now unbind me."
7,1,SAM:,We can't. Y-yet.
7,1,DEATH:,This isn't going to end well.
7,1,DEAN:,We need you to kill God.
7,1,DEATH:,Pardon?
7,1,BOBBY:,Kill God. You heard right. Your... Honor.
7,1,DEATH:,What makes you think I can do that?
7,1,DEAN:,You told me.
7,1,DEATH:,Why should I?
7,1,DEAN:,"Because... We said so, and we're the boss of you. I mean... Respectfully."
7,1,CASTIEL:,Amazing.
7,1,SAM:,Cas.
7,1,CASTIEL:,"I didn't want to kill you, but now..."
7,1,DEAN:,You can't kill us.
7,1,CASTIEL:,"You've erased any nostalgia I had for you, Dean."
7,1,DEAN:,"Death is our bitch. We ain't gonna die, even if God pulls the trigger."
7,1,DEATH:,"Annoying little protozoa, aren't they? ""God""? You look awfully like a mutated angel to me. Your vessel's melting. You're going to explode."
7,1,CASTIEL:,"No, I'm not. When I've finished my work, I'll repair myself."
7,1,DEATH:,"You think you can because you think you're simply under the weight of all those souls, yes? But that's not the worst problem. There are things much older than souls in Purgatory, and you gulped those in, too."
7,1,CASTIEL:,Irrelevant. I control them.
7,1,DEATH:,For the moment.
7,1,DEAN:,"Wait -- uh, what older things?"
7,1,DEATH:,"Long before God created Angel and man, he made the first beasts -- the Leviathans."
7,1,DEAN:,Leviathans?
7,1,DEATH:,"I personally found them entertaining, but he was concerned they'd chomp the entire petri dish, so he locked them away. Why do you think he created Purgatory? To keep those clever, poisonous things out. Now Castiel has swallowed them. He's the one thin membrane between the old ones and your home."
7,1,CASTIEL:,Enough.
7,1,DEATH:,Stupid little soldier you are.
7,1,CASTIEL:,"Why? Because I dared open a door that he shut? Where is he? I did a service, taking his place."
7,1,DEATH:,Service? Settling petty vendettas?
7,1,CASTIEL:,No. I'm cleaning up one mess after another -- selflessly.
7,1,DEATH:,Quite the humanitarian.
7,1,CASTIEL:,"And how would you know? What are you, really? A flyswatter?"
7,1,DEATH:,"Destined to swat you, I think."
7,1,CASTIEL:,Unless I take you first.
7,1,DEATH:,"Really bought his own press, this one. Please, Cas. I know God, and you, sir, are no God."
7,1,DEAN:,"All right, put your junk away, both of you. Look, call him what you want. Just kill him now!"
7,1,DEATH:,All right. Fine.
7,1,SENATOR'S AIDE:,Sir? Can I help you?
7,1,CASTIEL:,I'm here to see the Senator.
7,1,SENATOR'S AIDE:,"Um, regarding?"
7,1,CASTIEL:,Abuse of power.
7,1,SENATOR'S AIDE:,Excuse me?
7,1,CASTIEL:,I am not petty. I'm punishing a woman who causes poverty and despair in my name. I put your needs first. Don't you understand?
7,1,CASTIEL:,All of you. I am a better God than my father. How can I make you understand?
7,1,DEATH:,Ahh.
7,1,DEAN:,Um...
7,1,DEATH:,"Shut up, Dean. I'm not here to tie your shoes every time you trip. I warned you about those souls how long ago? Long enough to stop that fool. And here we are again, with your little planet on the edge of immolation."
7,1,DEAN:,"Well, I'm sorry. All right? I've been trying to save this planet, so maybe you should find somebody better to tip off."
7,1,DEATH:,"Maybe I should spend my effort on a better planet. Well, it's been amusing."
7,1,SAM:,"Wait, h-hold on, hold on. Just -- can you give us something? You -- you have to care a little bit about what happens to us."
7,1,DEATH:,"You know, I really don't. But I do find that little angel arrogant."
7,1,DEAN:,Great. Let's go with that.
7,1,DEATH:,Your only hope is to have him return it all to Purgatory. Quickly.
7,1,SAM:,We need a door.
7,1,DEATH:,You have everything you need at that lab. Get him to return there and compel him to give up the power.
7,1,DEAN:,Compel?
7,1,DEATH:,Figure it out.
7,1,BOBBY:,"But that door only opens in the eclipse, and that's over."
7,1,DEATH:,"I'll make another. 3:59 Sunday morning, just before dawn. Be punctual. Don't thank me. Clean up your mess. Try to bind me again, you'll die before you start. Nice pickle chips, by the way."
7,1,CASTIEL:,No. No. No.
7,1,SAM:,You want some coffee with that?
7,1,DEAN:,It's 6:00 p.m. somewhere.
7,1,SAM:,"We got to hit the road. I mean, how are we supposed to get Cas to that lab by friggin' 3:59 a.m.?"
7,1,DEAN:,We don't.
7,1,SAM:,"What do you mean, ""We don't""?"
7,1,DEAN:,"I mean, we can't bring the horse to water, and we can't make it drink. Why fool ourselves?"
7,1,SAM:,"Dean, look, I know you think that Cas is gone --"
7,1,DEAN:,It's 'cause he is.
7,1,SAM:,"He's not! He's in there somewhere, Dean. I know it."
7,1,DEAN:,"No, you don't."
7,1,SAM:,"No, I don't. But, look, I was pretty far gone sometimes myself, and never gave up on me."
7,1,DEAN:,"Yeah, and it turns out that you're about the same open book as you've always been. Hallucinations? Really? I got to find out from Death?"
7,1,SAM:,What was I supposed to do?
7,1,DEAN:,How about not lie? How about tell me that you've got crazy crap climbing those walls?
7,1,SAM:,"Why? You can't help. You got a lot of pretty severe crap swinging your way lately, and -- and I thought --what? I thought why burst the one good bubble you had left? It's under control."
7,1,DEAN:,"What? What, exactly, is under control?"
7,1,SAM:,I know what's real and what's not.
7,1,DEAN:,Sam --
7,1,SAM:,"Dean, look, we can debate this once we deal with Cas."
7,1,DEAN:,"Yeah, you know how I'm gonna deal? I'm gonna stuff my piehole, I'm gonna drink, and I'm gonna watch some Asian cartoon porn and act like the world's about to explode because it is. Hey. You got to be kidding me. ""Massacre at the campaign office of an incumbent Senator by a trench-coated man."" There's security footage. Well, I think reaching Cas is, uh... out of the cards."
7,1,SAM:,"Hey, Castiel. Um... Maybe this is pointless. Look... I don't know if any part of you even cares, but, um, I still think you're one of us, deep down. I mean, way, way, way off the reservation, but... Look, we still have till dawn to stop this. Let us help. Please."
7,1,SAM:,Only if you turn that off.
7,1,CASTIEL:,Sam?
7,1,SAM:,Cas.
7,1,CASTIEL:,I heard your call. I need help.
7,1,CASTIEL:,"We need the right blood. There's a small jar -- end of the hall, s-supply closet."
7,1,SAM:,Got it.
7,1,CASTIEL:,Dean?
7,1,DEAN:,"What, you need something else?"
7,1,CASTIEL:,"No. I feel regret, about you and what I did to Sam."
7,1,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, you should."
7,1,CASTIEL:,"If there was time, if I was strong enough, I'd -- I'd fix him now. I just wanted to make amends before I die."
7,1,DEAN:,Okay.
7,1,CASTIEL:,Is it working?
7,1,DEAN:,Does it make you feel better?
7,1,CASTIEL:,No. You?
7,1,DEAN:,Not a bit.
7,1,LUCIFER:,"I know. It all seems so silly, doesn't it? Hi, Sam. Long time, no spooning."
7,1,SAM:,You're not here. You're in Hell.
7,1,LUCIFER:,"Now, that you're right on."
7,1,SAM:,Meat hooks... Chains... You. It's not real. It's just my brain leaking memories from the cage 'cause of the wall breaking down. That's all.
7,1,LUCIFER:,"Hmm. That's very good, your little theory. It's wrong. Sam, this isn't you going guano. Everything else is."
7,1,SAM:,What?
7,1,LUCIFER:,Everything... From the second you sprung out of that lock box.
7,1,SAM:,That's impossible.
7,1,LUCIFER:,"No. Escaping was impossible. I have to say, I think this is my best torture yet -- make you believe that you're free and then... Yank the wool off of your eyes. You never left, Sam. You're still in the cage... With me."
7,1,BOBBY:,Hang in there. Just a couple of minutes. Where's Sam? It's go time.
7,1,DEAN:,Sam?! Damn it.
7,1,BOBBY:,"That's good enough. Okay, step right up, Cas."
7,1,BOBBY:,"Ianua magna purgatorii, clausa est ob nos lumine eius ab oculis nostris retento sed nunc stamus ad limen huius ianuae magnae et demisse fideliter perhonorifice paramus aperire eam."
7,1,CASTIEL:,"I'm sorry, Dean."
7,1,BOBBY:,"Creaturae terrificae quarum ungulae et dentes nunquam tetigerunt carnem eius ad mundum nostrum nunc ianua magna, aperta tandem!"
7,1,DEAN:,Cas?
7,1,BOBBY:,He's cold.
7,1,DEAN:,Is he breathing?
7,1,BOBBY:,No.
7,1,DEAN:,Maybe angels don't need to breathe.
7,1,BOBBY:,"He's gone, Dean."
7,1,DEAN:,"Damn it. Cas, you child. Why didn't you listen to me? Cas?! Hey! Hey! Okay. All right."
7,1,CASTIEL:,That was unpleasant.
7,1,DEAN:,"Let's get him up. Easy, there."
7,1,CASTIEL:,I'm alive.
7,1,BOBBY:,Looks like.
7,1,CASTIEL:,I'm astonished. Thank you -- both of you.
7,1,BOBBY:,We were mostly... just trying to save the world.
7,1,CASTIEL:,I'm ashamed. I really overreached.
7,1,DEAN:,You think?
7,1,CASTIEL:,I'm gonna find some way to redeem myself to you.
7,1,DEAN:,"All right, well, one thing at a time. Come on. Let's get you out of here. Come on."
7,1,CASTIEL:,"I mean it, Dean."
7,1,DEAN:,"Okay. All right. But let's go find Sam, okay?"
7,1,CASTIEL:,You need to run now! I-I can't hold them back!
7,1,DEAN:,Hold who back?
7,1,CASTIEL:,"They held on inside me. Dean, they're so strong."
7,1,DEAN:,Who the hell --?
7,1,CASTIEL:,Leviathan! I can't fight them. Run!
7,1,DEAN:,Go! Go get Sam! Go get Sam!
7,1,LEVIATHAN:,Too late.
7,1,DEAN:,Cas?
7,1,LEVIATHAN:,"Cas is -- he's gone. He's dead. We run the show now. Ah. Oh, this is going to be so much fun."
7,2,BOBBY,
7,2,STUDENT 2,I guess we got here early. Heard something weird come from the showers.
7,5,STYLIST:,There you are.
7,5,STYLIST:,All right.
7,5,STYLIST:,10 minutes. Holler if you need anything.
7,5,WOMAN:,Chris!
7,5,WOMAN:,Ow. Chri— Ow.
7,5,WOMAN:,"Ow. Chris, get back here!"
7,5,WOMAN:,[screaming] Chr-i-i-i-is! Chris!
7,5,STYLIST:,"Oh, my God. Somebody, help!"
7,5,CHRIS:,Aaaagh!
7,5,FLASHBACKS,
7,5,SAM:,Leave me alone! I said shut up! Just stop! Stop!
7,5,DEAN:,You are what you are. You will kill again.
7,5,AMY:,I won't. I swear.
7,5,LAPTOP SCREEN,
7,5,1. 3,30pm Today – SECOND OF TWO FREAKY DEATHS IN TWO WEEKS
7,5,DEAN:,Somebody better be chasing you.
7,5,SAM:,It's good for you.
7,5,DEAN:,"No. No, it's not good for you. Look at you. You're, you're a mess, and you stink. Well, while you were out being Lance Armstrong..."
7,5,SAM:,That would be biking.
7,5,DEAN:,"...I was working. You ever heard of a town called Prosperity, Indiana?"
7,5,SAM:,Has anybody?
7,5,DEAN:,"Two of their fine citizens died over the past two weeks. Uh, this one chick, she, uh, roasted underneath one of those beehive hair dryers at the hair salon..."
7,5,DEAN:,...and this other guy boiled in a hot tub.
7,5,SAM:,You don't see a lot of that.
7,5,DEAN:,"No, you don't."
7,5,SAM:,It's worth checking out.
7,5,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,5,SAM:,"You know, one more thing. What's going on with you?"
7,5,DEAN:,"We have had this conversation, Sam."
7,5,SAM:,"No, we haven't. See, to do that, you'd have to, uh, sort of...speak."
7,5,DEAN:,"Okay, let's see if you can get this straight. See you're – you're new Sam, right, Lance Armstrong."
7,5,SAM:,Biking.
7,5,DEAN:,"And, uh – and I'm still me, okay? All right, so – so, you might see things different now, uh – call it a runner's high or some crap – but that doesn't mean that something's going on with me, okay?"
7,5,SAM:,"Yeah, okay."
7,5,DEAN:,"No, don't say, ""yeah, okay,"" like, ""yeah, okay."""
7,5,SAM:,"Yeah, okay."
7,5,SAM:,I'm very sorry. I-I know this is a tough time to have to talk about all this.
7,5,WOMAN:,"I've already been through it so many times with the lawyers, the police, the insurance guys."
7,5,SAM:,Right. I know. I know. We just – we have to conduct our own separate investigation. I'm sorry. I know it's tough. Can I ask you – did your sister have any enemies?
7,5,WENDY’S SISTER:,Why do you ask that? You think her death wasn't accidental?
7,5,SAM:,"No. No, no, no. We just have to consider every possibility. Is there anyone who might have wanted to harm her?"
7,5,WENDY’S SISTER:,"You don't live here, so you don't know. Everyone...loved Wendy. She volunteered at the church. She ran a group for kids. I was the big sister, and I looked up to her."
7,5,SAM:,What about this man who died – Carl Dunlap? Did she know him?
7,5,WENDY’S SISTER:,I don't think so.
7,5,SAM:,"Well, Wendy was in real estate, right? Carl was an architect. Maybe they had some business dealings?"
7,5,WENDY’S SISTER:,"If they had worked together, I would've heard the name. Agent Sambora... If someone did this to my sister, find out who."
7,5,DEAN:,And nobody was back here but Wendy.
7,5,CHRIS:,No. But I was only gone for a minute.
7,5,DEAN:,You can't even crank these things past a certain temperature – am I wrong?
7,5,CHRIS:,"If it started to blow a fuse or something, it would have shut down."
7,5,DEAN:,"Oh. Basically, you're saying that this couldn't have happened."
7,5,CHRIS:,"Basically, I'm saying it couldn't have happened."
7,5,CHRIS:,The insurance adjusters already did that.
7,5,DEAN:,Thanks for the heads-up.
7,5,MAN:,"Oh, come on!"
7,5,DEAN:,"So, what do we know about the vic?"
7,5,POLICEMAN:,"Dewey Stevens – owner, Dewey Stevens Construction, biggest outfit in town. Rotarian, Methodist, tenor, blue-ribbon pecan pie champ, asthmatic."
7,5,POLICEMAN:,We're a close-knit community.
7,5,DEAN:,"So, this, um, pillar of the community – he was taking a leak before he, uh, sprung a few?"
7,5,POLICEMAN:,The crew had gone for the day. Site was shut down.
7,5,DEAN:,Anything unusual besides the nails in the eyes?
7,5,POLICEMAN:,"Well, we're still trying to figure out where they plugged in the nail gun, seeing as there's no generator on the truck."
7,5,DEAN:,"Well, when you figure that out, let me know."
7,5,DEAN:,"So, another victim everybody likes."
7,5,SAM:,Not everybody.
7,5,DEAN:,Another physically impossible death. You got any ideas?
7,5,SAM:,Cirque du Soleil?
7,5,DEAN:,"Oh, I, uh, found another one of these, just like at the, uh, the hair-dryer/brain-roast."
7,5,SAM:,"And I found a connection with all the vics. Um, these e-mail logs show Wendy, the real-estate chick, uh, Carl, the architect, and this Dewey guy were all working on a shopping center project together."
7,5,DEAN:,Why didn't we know about that?
7,5,SAM:,"I- Well, it all fell apart for some reason. I mean, there are these e-mails back and forth, pretty hot and heavy, and suddenly they just stopped."
7,5,DEAN:,"So, everybody working on this project has died?"
7,5,SAM:,"Well, not yet. Um, they were working with a developer, a guy named Don Stark."
7,5,DEAN:,Don Stark? Why do I know that name?
7,5,SAM:,"Man, this Stark guy is really plugged in, huh?"
7,5,DEAN:,"So, all the players in this – this shopping-center project have either fried, boiled, or kebabbed. He could be next."
7,5,SAM:,"Really? From a freaking flask? What are you, bad Santa? On the job?"
7,5,DEAN:,We're always on the job.
7,5,SAM:,"All right. Bobby e-mailed back. I sent him a few pics of those coins you found. He says the writing is Romanian Cyrillic, used only in the mid-15th to the 19th century. Apparently, it's an antique Wallachian ducat."
7,5,DEAN:,"So, we're looking for an old Romanian?"
7,5,SAM:,"You know, is it just me, or is this really weird?"
7,5,DEAN:,"Huh. I've seen this once before, where t-the plants are all dead in one spot."
7,5,SAM:,Where?
7,5,DEAN:,"A bus bench with Wendy Goodson's picture on it. I mean, I'm no expert, but I don't think plants are supposed to act like this."
7,5,MUSIC,See the Funny Little Clown by Bobby Goldsboro
7,5,DON STARK:,"If the bureau's involved, I assume you think all three were murdered."
7,5,DEAN:,"It's looking that way, yes."
7,5,SAM:,"Now, Mr. Stark, you had a relationship with all three victims, correct?"
7,5,DON STARK:,"Oh, I knew them in business circles, I guess, sure."
7,5,DEAN:,"And you were all involved in a, uh, a-a shopping-center project. Why'd that fall through?"
7,5,DON STARK:,"Uh, t-these things happen."
7,5,DON STARK:,"Oh. Jenny. These gentlemen are from the FBI. Jenny Klein, my assistant."
7,5,JENNY:,"Hi, there. Okay, Don, I'm off to the cleaner's, and then I'm gonna stop at Beaman, Beaman, and Beaman for the revised contracts."
7,5,DON STARK:,Hurry on back. You know how things fall apart without you.
7,5,JENNY:,"[laughs] Oh, I baked you some cupcakes – coconut."
7,5,DON STARK:,"Coconut – you're too good to me, Jenny."
7,5,JENNY:,I'll see you soon.
7,5,DON STARK:,She bakes cupcakes.
7,5,DEAN:,Yummy.
7,5,SAM:,"You know, could you point me to the restroom? I had a little bit too much java."
7,5,DON STARK:,"Yeah, around the corner, down the hall."
7,5,SAM:,Thanks.
7,5,DEAN:,"So, uh, usually in cases like these –"
7,5,DEAN (V-O):,"Oh, you'd be surprised. Uh, we start out with the basics."
7,5,DEAN:,You have any business rivals?
7,5,DON STARK:,"Sure, tons. You know, real estate's brutal."
7,5,DEAN:,"Well, that was easy."
7,5,DON STARK:,"On the other hand, I've demonstrated my love for this town, and I think it's safe to say I'm respected for what I've done here."
7,5,DON STARK:,"Yeah, one of my real treasures."
7,5,DEAN:,"""To Don – take no prisoners. D. Trump."" The Trumpster! Wow."
7,5,DON STARK:,"Like I said, success breeds fierce competition..."
7,5,DON STARK:,"... but in the end, everyone here respects and admires me."
7,5,SAM:,Including your wife?
7,5,SAM:,"Sorry. It's just, we heard the two of you were splitting up, right?"
7,5,DEAN:,"Yeah, that's, uh – that's what we heard."
7,5,DON STARK:,"Yeah, Maggie and I are going through a tough time. It's a separation – temporary. Sometimes, you know, you grow apart. It's no one's fault."
7,5,SAM:,"And how would you describe the, uh – the issues between you and your wife?"
7,5,DON STARK:,"It’s just one of those marital misunderstandings, you know."
7,5,SAM:,"No, I'm sorry. I don't."
7,5,DON STARK:,"It's one of those vague, hard-to-define passages."
7,5,DEAN:,"She caught you cheating, huh? I couldn't help but notice, uh, things were kind of cordial between you and your assistant. Pretty good with the ladies there, Mr. Stark? It's a blessing and a curse, isn't it?"
7,5,DON STARK:,"Guys, I'm a people person, and I admire dynamic, confident women."
7,5,SAM:,"""Admire""?"
7,5,DON STARK:,"Okay, look – it's true I had a recent... little thing with a business associate, but that's all it was."
7,5,DEAN:,"A ""thing""?"
7,5,DON STARK:,Yeah.
7,5,SAM:,Like a – like a shoe or a golf club.
7,5,DEAN:,Right. Like a waffle iron.
7,5,SAM:,Yeah.
7,5,DEAN:,"Yeah. No, see, Don, uh, wives generally think of an affair as something more than a thing."
7,5,DON STARK:,"Yes, and when Maggie found out about it, she needed some time off, temporarily."
7,5,DEAN:,"Hmm. Now, if we were to guess that the, uh, uh, business associate was Wendy Goodson, would we win the weekend trip to Maui?"
7,5,DON STARK:,"No, her death had nothing to do with the affair. It was over long before her accident."
7,5,DEAN:,If it was an accident.
7,5,DON STARK:,You're not implying that Maggie was behind this.
7,5,SAM:,"No, we're not implying anything. We're just saying... you should be careful. And take her to dinner and apologize."
7,5,DEAN:,"Yeah, and, uh, grovel. Wouldn't hurt."
7,5,SAM:,Found a bunch of hex junk in their stuff – clearly her thing. And the empty closet didn't seem like she was coming back anytime soon.
7,5,DEAN:,"So, Don admires Wendy, biblically, Wendy dies weird, and the scorned wife is into the dark stuff."
7,5,SAM:,While Don's just in the dark.
7,5,DEAN:,"Hmm. It's kind of like ""Bewitched."" You know, Don's Darrin, doesn't even know it. A lot of laughs until, uh, you cheat on your wife."
7,5,SAM:,"A ""Bewitched"" reference. Really?"
7,5,DEAN:,"Dude, Nicole Kidman was in the remake. Redhead. Hello!"
7,5,SAM:,Look at all these dead plants.
7,5,DEAN:,Huh. It's kind of like the real-estate lady's place and Don's statue thing.
7,5,SAM:,"You know, if she's strong enough, just being pissed off is enough to send some pretty bad vibes their way."
7,5,DEAN:,Literally kill off everything around her just by pms-ing at it. Eeh. That's not creepy at all.
7,5,DEAN:,He's on it.
7,5,DEAN:,"Don, keep it in your pants, man."
7,5,RECORDED MESSAGE:,All circuits are busy.
7,5,SAM:,Mrs. Stark.
7,5,SAM:,Could I have a moment?
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"Of course. Um, would you mind coming back in, say, a half an hour? It's just a really bad time right now."
7,5,SAM:,It's very important that I talk to you.
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"Of course, and I'm happy to. I'm just in the middle of an emergency, so please come back. Thank you!"
7,5,SAM:,I'm sorry – uh... restless leg syndrome.
7,5,DEAN:,Spoiler alert.
7,5,DEAN:,"Jenny Klein's next. Swiped her photo off a hex deck, but Maggie's gonna notice it's gone eventually. We got to get over to Jenny's."

7,5,DEAN:,"Find the coin, now!"
7,5,DEAN:,"Come on, Sam!"
7,5,JENNY:,"There were tiny beating hearts in my cupcakes. There were hearts in my cupcakes, hearts in my cupcakes! [becoming hysterical] That's never happened before! Hearts in my cupcakes!"
7,5,DEAN:,Should I slug her?
7,5,SAM:,Give it a second.
7,5,JENNY:,"Oh, my God. What just happened?"
7,5,SAM:,You were hexed.
7,5,JENNY:,Hexed? Who are you people? What the hell do I do?
7,5,DEAN:,"What you do is you go in there and you pack a bag, you get in your car, and you go."
7,5,JENNY:,Go where?
7,5,SAM:,"It doesn't matter. Look, 500 or 600 miles ought to do it. You got someone real powerful real pissed, and they're trying to get rid of you now. In line with that, you might want to cool things with Don Stark."
7,5,JENNY:,Don Stark? What are you talking about?
7,5,DEAN:,You and Don. You know.
7,5,JENNY:,"""You know""? There's no ""you know."""
7,5,SAM:,No?
7,5,JENNY:,"Don Stark is my boss. That's it. He's married, for God sakes."
7,5,DEAN:,"Yeah, well..."
7,5,JENNY:,Me and Don Stark. Ew.
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,What are you doing? Bunch these tables more in the middle. Give me a more air between paintings.
7,5,WOMAN:,"Hey. Maggie, can you sign for the flowers? I've checked them. They're fine."
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"Thank you, Sue. What would I do without you?"
7,5,SUE:,"Oh, please, I like helping. What are best friends for?"
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"It's just been so tough to focus with Don, the whole mess."
7,5,SUE:,"It's like he put a knife right in your heart, isn't it?"
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,Yes.
7,5,SUE:,Was I wrong to tell you about him and Wendy?
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,No. No. You think I'd want you to stand by and watch him make a fool of me? I love you for what you did.
7,5,SUE:,"I love you, too."
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"No, no, no. The still life doesn't go there. It goes on the left side."
7,5,SUE:,Don.
7,5,DON STARK:,Where's my wife?
7,5,SUE:,You mean the one who's divorcing you?
7,5,DON STARK:,"Sue, I know you can hardly wait until I'm out of the picture..."
7,5,DON STARK:,... and I know it's been a thrill whispering lies into Maggie's ear --
7,5,SUE:,"Oh, but they weren't lies, were they, Don?"
7,5,DON STARK:,I made one mistake – one.
7,5,SUE:,I sincerely doubt that.
7,5,DON STARK:,This is between Maggie and me. It has nothing to do with you.
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"What do you want, Don?"
7,5,DON STARK:,I'd like to speak with you.
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,Make it quick.
7,5,DON STARK:,"Okay. You know what, Maggie? I think I've been patient. And you've had your fun. It was very creative, the thing with Wendy, but, you know, enough is enough."
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"No, Don, enough is not enough, not even close."
7,5,DON STARK:,"What do you want, my oysters on a tray?"
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"Well, now that you mention it --"
7,5,DON STARK:,"The fact is, none of this was my fault! Maybe if you'd been around a little more. But between the art and the charity and that evil bitch Sue, I was edged right out of your life."
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"Oh, boo-hoo, Mr. Big Shot, Mr. ""I got to put my name on every public works in town."""
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"There was three of us in this marriage – me, you, and your ego. That was the problem, Don. So, excuse me. I have a charity event to arrange."
7,5,DON STARK:,"Two FBI agents came by, asking questions."
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"Hunters, sweetheart – that's what they are. Oh, I can see you're terribly concerned for my safety, but don't worry – I'll take care of it."
7,5,DON STARK:,"Maggie, this stops. You hear me? As of now."
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,You're so cute when you try to tell me what to do.
7,5,DEAN:,"Now she's just getting nasty. Killing the girlfriend is one thing, but his commemorative bust? That's got to hurt."
7,5,SAM:,"She'll take the whole town out, Dean. She don't care who gets in the way."
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"Hello, everyone, and thanks for coming. Most of you know that philanthropy and art are my two passions, but what we've – not there! Where is the ice? People will be here in seconds. What we've assembled here tonight may be my crowning achievement, not to be immodest."
7,5,SUE:,See? I told you. Everything's perfect.
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"Yeah, you – you just reminded me. I have to check on the finger sandwiches."
7,5,DEAN:,Dude. Pie.
7,5,DEAN:,Ugh. That is --
7,5,SAM:,"Chicken feet, just like the recipe calls for. Butcher's fridge is down."
7,5,DEAN:,I can smell that.
7,5,SAM:,"Uh, says the power's been wonky and that he's lost so much product, he probably won't make rent. Ditto every shop on the block – nothing but burst pipes and blackouts."
7,5,DEAN:,Huh.
7,5,SAM:,"He says it's like all of a sudden, the town ran out of luck."
7,5,DEAN:,"So, coincidence, right?"
7,5,SAM:,Uh...yeah. We're past the point of dead flowers.
7,5,DEAN:,"What can I say? I guess the witch is pissed. All right, let's, uh – we better get a move on here. Why don't you just..."
7,5,DEAN:,C-can you take the feet?
7,5,SAM:,Ugh.
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,To us. I couldn't have done it without you.
7,5,SUE:,To us.
7,5,SUE:,That is disgusting!
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,No.
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,No. Not my paintings.
7,5,SUE:,Maggie? What is going on?
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,He did this. How could he? He knew what this meant to me.
7,5,SUE:,Do you mean Don? Don rigged all this?
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,Yes!
7,5,SUE:,But how?
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,Just trust me. He wants to hurt me.
7,5,SUE:,"I told you – he's a dick. But we'll get through this because you have people who love you, and he can't take that away from you."
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"Fine, Donald. It's war."
7,5,DEAN:,What the hell?
7,5,DEAN:,Whoa. Clean-up on aisle 7.
7,5,SAM:,"Okay, I don't guess she'd do this to her own auction."
7,5,DEAN:,"No, obviously it was someone who hated her guts and wanted her party trashed."
7,5,SAM:,Don Stark.
7,5,DEAN:,"So, the mister's a witch, himself. That means we got not just one pissed-off witch. We've got two. It's full-on ""War of the Roses."""
7,5,SAM:,"""Bewitched"" just got a lot less funny."
7,5,DEAN:,It's like when they switched Darrins.
7,5,SAM:,Where is she?
7,5,DEAN:,She'll be here. They've been throwing thunderbolts at each other's favorite toys. There's nothing left to destroy but each other. This is basically ground zero.
7,5,SAM:,I hope so. We're gonna need them both in the same place if we're gonna take them down.
7,5,DEAN:,"Screens up, Captain."
7,5,DON STARK:,"Want one, sweetie?"
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,Shove it. We are so having it out right now.
7,5,DEAN:,Furor divina virtute in infernum eam detrude!
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,Let me guess – chicken feet? Not chilled?
7,5,DON STARK:,"For obvious reasons, you won't be leaving this room."
7,5,DON STARK:,"Well, you will be leaving – just not alive. Maggie?"
7,5,SAM:,"Okay, plan B."
7,5,DEAN:,What's plan B?
7,5,SAM:,Talking.
7,5,DEAN:,Now? Really?
7,5,SAM:,"This is obviously a domestic dispute. So if you can't kill them, counsel them."
7,5,DEAN:,Yeah. You know what? Not my area!
7,5,DEAN:,"Okay, okay, okay. Uh..."
7,5,DEAN:,"Look – obviously, you two are capable of wiping each other out, right? But you haven't, huh? Which means that you two – you still value whatever it is you got. A-and you want keep that dance going. Maybe it's – maybe it's punishment. Maybe it's – it's sick, messed-up, erotic, kinky, clamps and feathers kind of love."
7,5,SAM:,"Okay, okay, t-that's – that's going way too deep, there, cowboy. Look, what he's trying to say is that – is that you two – whatever it is you have, you're bonded."
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"Are you out of your mind? He cheated on me, humiliated me."
7,5,SAM:,"We're not trying to say what Don did was right. When a relationship cracks, usually both parties have a hand in it."
7,5,DON STARK:,Indeed.
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,You're defending him?
7,5,SAM:,Ugh!
7,5,DEAN:,"Whoa! Okay, okay! Okay, look – n-nobody can defend Don. Right? Uh, totally. But, uh, we get that you feel betrayed...because you were."
7,5,DON STARK:,Don't suck up to her.
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,I was betrayed by all of them. Carl introduced you to Wendy. Dewey covered for you. Wendy did you!
7,5,SAM:,"Okay, okay, look --"
7,5,SAM:,I got to say I-I don't think Don was lying when he said he regrets the whole Wendy thing.
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"""Thing""? Sit down."
7,5,SAM:,"Aagh! Ugh! Yeah, affair – that's right, terrible."
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,I think the only thing he regrets is getting caught.
7,5,DON STARK:,Wendy was nothing to me. It was over as soon as it started.
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"She was part of a pattern, okay? I've had 800 years of this. Do not make me bring up the Renaissance!"
7,5,DON STARK:,Oh! Oh! You're one to talk. 1492 ring any bells?
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"The man was about to set sail! He could possibly fall off of the edge of the earth. I took pity. So, what's your excuse?"
7,5,DON STARK:,I told you – nothing happened with the Medici chick! You've always been insanely jealous.
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"Oh, I wonder why! Jenny. Wendy."
7,5,DON STARK:,Jenny? Nothing happened with Jenny. She's just my assistant.
7,5,DEAN:,"That's true. She, uh – she told us – just an assistant."
7,5,DEAN:,Whoa!
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,Is that true?
7,5,DON STARK:,"Yes, I swear it, babe. I would never. I made a mistake. I'm sorry, Maggie."
7,5,SAM:,"See? See? Guys, guys... You're talking."
7,5,SAM:,"All these years, you – you – you buried your anger and your disappointment till it tore you apart. All you needed to do was talk."
7,5,DEAN:,"And I would have missed the nuking that my melon just took. Well, who wants that?"
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,Nice touch.
7,5,DON STARK:,Thank you.
7,5,DON STARK:,"He's right. I couldn't kill you. All I ever wanted is you, Mags. I've been crushing on you since forever. You're the woman that I want to never grow old with."
7,5,MAGGIE STARK:,"I could never murder you either, Don. It's crazy... But true."
7,5,DEAN:,Somebody want to call these things off? Ex-- excuse me!
7,5,DEAN:,"Oh, give me a break."
7,5,SAM:,I didn't say anything.
7,5,DEAN:,It's been a long day.
7,5,CHET:,And it's not over yet.
7,5,CHET:,"Hi, Sam. Hi, Dean."
7,5,SAM:,Do we know you?
7,5,CHET:,"Well, I definitely know you. You're the dead guys. Well, you will be in a minute."
7,5,CHET:,Sorry. You're a bit outmatched.
7,5,DEAN:,"Don. Well, thank you. We owe you."
7,5,DON STARK:,Good God. What is that thing?
7,5,SAM:,I guess we should be figuring that out.
7,5,DEAN:,It is on our to-do list.
7,5,DON STARK:,"You know, find a bottomless pit and drop it in. Spell only lasts for a few days."
7,5,SAM:,"Uh, what are you even doing here?"
7,5,DON STARK:,"Apparently, saving your lives – twice."
7,5,DON STARK:,Got it.
7,5,SAM:,Maggie? Seriously?
7,5,DEAN:,She was gonna kill us? We just saved your damn marriage.
7,5,DON STARK:,"Yeah, but to be fair, you also tried to kill her. You know how she is when she gets a bug up her ass. Got to love her, right? Right. Bottomless pit. Ciao!"
7,5,DEAN:,We should hit the road. You ready?
7,5,SAM:,"Hey, were you, um, were you listening to the Starks tonight?"
7,5,DEAN:,"Uh, a little, when I wasn't getting slammed into a wall or stung by bees."
7,5,SAM:,"You notice how they, uh, you know, how they – how they opened up, got everything off their chest?"
7,5,DEAN:,Yeah. Kudos on selling them that crap.
7,5,SAM:,"It wasn't crap, Dean. It worked."
7,5,DEAN:,"Sam, I am so very, very, very, very...very, very tired --"
7,5,SAM:,"Dean, like it or not, the stuff you don't talk about doesn't just go away. It builds up, like whatever's eating at you right now."
7,5,DEAN:,"There's always something eating at me. That's who I am. Something happens, I feel responsible, all right? The Lindbergh baby – that's on me. Unemployment – my bad."
7,5,SAM:,That's not what I'm talking about.
7,5,DEAN:,"Well, then what the hell are you talking about?"
7,5,SAM:,"I'm talking about whatever you're not telling me about. Look, Dean, it's fine. You can unload. That's kind of what I'm here for."
7,5,SAM:,"I mean... we're good, right?"
7,5,DEAN:,We're good.
7,6,SAM:,You sure about this?
7,6,DEAN:,Trust me.
7,6,DEAN:,"Good morning... Megan. That is a really, really pretty dress."
7,6,MEGAN:,Oh!
7,6,MEGAN:,Thank you. It's vintage.
7,6,DEAN:,"Well, it looks new on you."
7,6,MEGAN:,"Aren't you sweet, sir?"
7,6,DEAN:,Call me Dean.
7,6,MEGAN:,"How can I help you today, Dean?"
7,6,DEAN:,"Um, well, I don't actually have an account at this bank, but I was wondering if there was any way..."
7,6,DEAN:,...I could get change for that?
7,6,MEGAN:,I think I can make an exception... just for you.
7,6,DEAN:,Thanks.
7,6,MEGAN:,"How do you want it, Dean?"
7,6,DEAN:,"[laughs] Well, I'm gonna have to take a rain check... and all your money."
7,6,SAM:,"Hands in the air! Hands in the air! Your money's insured, so no heroes, okay?"
7,6,DEAN:,Get in there!

7,6,DEAN:,Yep.

7,6,CHET:,Hmm.
7,6,CHET:,"Okay. Similar finish to holy water, not as bitter as rock salt."
7,6,CHET:,And how are my two favorite meat-sicles?
7,6,DEAN:,Is he still sucking air?
7,6,BOBBY:,Greatest hits didn't do the trick. I'm down to B-sides and deep cuts.
7,6,DEAN:,"Well, you better figure out something quick. That whammy that witch dude put on him is only gonna last for a few days. He gets his spinach back, we're gonna end up having to drop a car on him just to stop him."
7,6,CHET:,"Actually... Edgar walked away from that car. He's fine. Well, he is a little pissed at you, but -- Oh. You didn't know?"
7,6,DEAN:,Why don't you shut your cake-trap?
7,6,CHET:,Ooh.
7,6,SAM:,Bobby... You've been using all this stuff and he still won't talk?
7,6,CHET:,"Huddle over, coach?"
7,6,DEAN:,How'd you find us?
7,6,CHET:,It was easy. I used pattern-recognition software and a basic heuristic algorithm to track your known aliases.
7,6,BOBBY:,Great. Just what we need -- a Mensa monster.
7,6,SAM:,All right. Let's just start with the start. Where'd you get our aliases?
7,6,CHET:,"From your trench-coated friend, obviously. When we were all nestled in at Camp Cas, kind of got
the full download. That's just how we do."
7,6,BOBBY:,"So why are you talking to us, Chet? You're not dumb. Why you spilling state secrets?"
7,6,CHET:,"'Cause I'm not scared of you. You can't stop me. You can't stop any of us. We can't be killed, you stupid little chewtoys. You are aware that I'm the least of your concerns, right? Oh. You haven't watched the news today, have you?"

7,6,JODY MILLS:,"Well, yeah... Seeing as they were fresh out of ""thanks for saving me from liver-eating surgeon"" cards at the store."
7,6,BOBBY:,"Oh, that. Just doing my job, which nobody pays me for."
7,6,JODY MILLS:,"Right. How you doing, Bobby?"
7,6,BOBBY:,I'm fine. Every day is a gift.
7,6,JODY MILLS:,Your house just burned down.
7,6,BOBBY:,"As you can see, I got a roof over me."
7,6,JODY MILLS:,Bobby! Let someone be nice to you for five minutes?
7,6,JODY MILLS:,'Course not. I can cook. Ish. You know? Why don't you let me make you something? Maybe put this new place of yours in some kind of order. Come on. I owe you that much.
7,6,BOBBY:,"Okay. Thanks, Sheriff."
7,6,JODY MILLS:,Jody.
7,6,CHET:,Did you think it would be that easy?
7,6,BOBBY:,No. But it's a start.
7,6,CHET:,Ugh.
7,6,SAM:,You okay?
7,6,DEAN:,"You know, it's bad enough that they're ganking people, wearing our mugs, but now this? Have us driving around in this... this caboodle while Baby's on lockdown."
7,6,SAM:,"It's temporary, Dean."
7,6,DEAN:,Nobody puts Baby in a corner.
7,6,SAM:,Y-you know that's a line from --
7,6,DEAN:,Swayze movie. Swayze always gets a pass!
7,6,SAM:,"Right. Uh, well, you want some tunes or something? Here."
7,6,MUSIC,Air Supply’s “All Out Of Love”
7,6,SAM:,"Sorry, man, I-I..."
7,6,DEAN:,Just leave it. Probably gonna be the only thing on.
7,6,SAM:,Here.
7,6,SAM:,Dean.
7,6,DEAN:,What?
7,6,SAM:,Jericho -- the lady in white.
7,6,SAM:,Blackwater -- wendigo. Lake Manitoc -- the kid in the lake.
7,6,DEAN:,They're hitting towns we've worked jobs in.
7,6,SAM:,In order. Since the day I left Stanford with you.
7,6,DEAN:,"So, what, they want us to find them?"
7,6,SAM:,"Well, one way to find out -- next case would be in...St. Louis."
7,6,DEAN:,"Perfect. Connor's Diner. Best burgers in St. Louis. Oh, I deserve something good in my life right now."
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"You know, he has one of these..."
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"...every day. And in his heart, he thinks they're almost as good as sex. This..."
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,...is disgusting.
7,6,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,"Dead plants with creamy goo. It's like eating self-righteousness. I mean, you tell me which is worse."
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"I mean, honestly, I just... You know what? I can't stand the guy. Talk about a hero complex. And he doesn't have relationships. No, he has applications for sainthood. Oh, and he thinks he's funny. He thinks he's a damn comedian."
7,6,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,Who has two thumbs and full-blown bats in the belfry?
7,6,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,"I'm serious. It's nothing but Satan-vision on the inside. I mean, how he's walking around in a jacket with detachable arms is beyond me. You know, I had a brother with this many issues once."
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Yeah?
7,6,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,Know what I did?
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Hmm?
7,6,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,I ate him.
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Of course you did.
7,6,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,How are these guys even a threat?
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"Boss says they gotta go, they gotta go."
7,6,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,"Right. Idea. You wanna trade? I mean, I'll take Chuckles over Schizo."
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"No, I like this one's hair better. You can stay in the big one."
7,6,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,"All right. In that case, let's turn up the heat. The sooner I get out of this and into something more stable, the better."
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Hold on.
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"Hey, kid. Hey. Why don't you fire up the camera on that thing?"
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Point it over here.
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Shall we?
7,6,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,"All right, everybody be cool! This is a robbery!"
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"Anybody moves, and I'll execute every last one of you!"
7,6,JODY MILLS:,"Hey, you take mayo, right, Bobby?"
7,6,POLICE OFFICER:,Unfortunately.
7,6,[RECORDING,
7,6,DINER CUSTOMERS:,No! No! [screaming]
7,6,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,"Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Keep that up! I didn't say you could put that down! I want the whole world to know what Sam and Dean Winchester are capable of."
7,6,DINER CUSTOMER:,No!
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,That all of 'em?
7,6,TEENAGER (V-O):,No!
7,6,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,All but one.
7,6,TEENAGER (V-O):,"No, please, no."
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"Well, goodnight, St. Louis. You've been a wonderful crowd. Grab your socks and hose, Iowa, 'cause we're headed to you next."
7,6,CHET:,Ooh.
7,6,BOBBY:,Balls.
7,6,CHET:,"It's pretty dark in here. High-school dropout. A drunk like your daddy before you. Oh. You and Dad. Now, that's a can of scorpions. Your favorite singer is Joni frickin' Mitchell? Oh, Bobby. You are 10 pounds of sad in a 5-pound bag."
7,6,DEAN:,"Sam, Sam. Hold up. Don't move. Don't move."
7,6,SAM:,"Oh, no. This is all sorts of wrong."
7,6,DEAN:,"Those are nice wheels. Tell you what, when this is over, I'm stealing those rims."
7,6,CHET:,Tell the kids I said hi.
7,6,BOBBY (V-O):,"Look, just hang back for now."
7,6,SHERIFF:,Hands in the air!
7,6,DEAN:,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
7,6,DEAN:,Big misunderstanding.
7,6,DEAN:,"Look, the guys you want --"
7,6,SHERIFF:,Shut up!
7,6,DEAN:,They're right there.
7,6,SHERIFF:,Shut up! Drop the phone. Put your hands in the air.
7,6,BOBBY (V-O):,Dean!
7,6,SHERIFF:,Cuff ’em.
7,6,CHET:,"You know the thing about you, Bobby..."
7,6,BOBBY:,"Save it. I already know me, handsome."
7,6,CHET:,"You got the gruff thing down. Seen more death than an electric chair. Ready to die with your boots on. But, you know, deep down inside... you're no cynic. You still hope. You even got a thing for that lady upstairs. Tiny part of you thinks, maybe... after this is all done, you and Miss Sheriff can make your own little cabin in the woods."
7,6,CHET:,"That's hilarious. You're not getting any older than tomorrow, Bobby. Why do you bother?"
7,6,BOBBY:,You a Browning fan?
7,6,CHET:,Come again?
7,6,BOBBY:,Robert Browning. Poet. You got that name rattling around up there with the rest of my thoughts and feelings?
7,6,CHET:,"It's kind of hard to sift through all the drunken blackouts, but --"
7,6,BOBBY:,"""A man's reach should exceed his grasp."""
7,6,CHET:,"I like that. That's actually lovely. Browning? After I eat you, I'm definitely gonna hit the library."
7,6,CHET:,What the hell is that?
7,6,CHET:,Get it off. Get it off! Get it off!!
7,6,CHET:,Get it off of me!
7,6,CHET:,Aaargh! Get it off me!
7,6,JODY MILLS:,"Oh, sorry. Little snafu here."
7,6,JODY MILLS:,"Mm! Okay, wasn't expecting that reaction."
7,6,BOBBY:,What the hell was in that bucket?
7,6,SAM:,"Look, you're making a mistake. The real killers are back at the diner, okay?"
7,6,SHERIFF:,Is that the best you can do?
7,6,DEAN:,I want my phone call.
7,6,SHERIFF:,"Oh, there'll be a call, to the FBI. Take him [indicates DEAN] to cell number one. Take that one [indicates SAM] to the interview room. Once they're separate and secure, you boys call it a night."
7,6,SAM:,You're making a mistake!
7,6,DEPUTY 3:,"What, did you guys forget something or what?"
7,6,DEAN:,Hey. I have a right to my phone call.
7,6,SHERIFF:,"A right? You killed how many people last couple days, and you want me to hop-to on your rights?"
7,6,DEAN:,I didn't -- please -- just give me one -- one phone call.
7,6,DEAN:,What'd you do that for?
7,6,SHERIFF:,Borax? Decapitation? What kind of sickos are you and your friends?
7,6,DEAN:,"Hey, you listen to me."
7,6,DEAN:,"If you don't go get every ounce, every drop of whatever that stuff is in this place right now, we're all gonna die!"
7,6,SHERIFF:,"Well, you're crazier than I thought."
7,6,DEAN:,Hey!
7,6,DEPUTY 2:,What are you doing?
7,6,DEPUTY 2:,What is your problem? We don't have time for lunch right now.
7,6,DEPUTY 1:,I was hungry.
7,6,DEPUTY 2:,Later. Let's go.
7,6,DEAN:,What is it? What happened?
7,6,SHERIFF:,I...It's just... I don't know what I just saw.
7,6,DEAN:,"Let me out of here. Okay, you listen to me, and we'll live. All right, keep your head down, get to the supply closet. Get anything that says Borax on it -- bring it here. Now. Go."
7,6,SAM:,Dean!
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,I'm not your brother. But I am Dean adjacent.
7,6,DEAN:,Sorry.
7,6,DEAN:,Sammy.
7,6,DEAN:,Not Sammy.
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"I just want to let you know how much I've really grown to hate you and your brother since we've been wearing you. I just don't get it. You could be anything. You're strong, you're uninhibited. 
You're smart enough, believe it or not. But you're so caught up in being good and taking care of each other."
7,6,SAM:,What do you care?
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Because it pisses me off! You're wasting a perfectly good opportunity to subjugate the weak.
7,6,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,Cute. Really think you can get close enough to use it?
7,6,DEAN:,Not until you're burning.
7,6,LEVIATHAN!SAM:,Aargh! Aargh!
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN (V-O):,Here's the deal.
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,Dean... thinks you're nutballs. He thinks you're off your game.
7,6,SAM:,"You gonna kill me, or is this some sort of ""play with your food"" bull?"
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"All right. All right. You know, I guess that's why Dean never told you that he killed Amy."
7,6,LEVIATHAN!DEAN:,"There it is. The look on your face. That is priceless! That's what I've been waiting for. Now I can eat you. 'Cause, you see, I like my meat a little bitter."
7,6,DEAN:,"Well, that felt good."
7,6,SHERIFF:,So... the FBI is on the way.
7,6,DEAN:,"Yeah, listen, about that..."
7,6,SHERIFF:,Whatever I can do... Especially if it involves lying about everything I just saw.
7,6,DEAN:,"Good. I was hoping you could help us kind of...be dead. You know, quote unquote."
7,6,SHERIFF:,"Yeah. Yeah, I should be able to swing that. All right."
7,6,DEAN:,"Come on, let's grab a mop."
7,6,DEAN:,Sammy? You okay?
7,6,SAM:,"Yeah, I'm fine."
7,6,DEAN:,Let's go.
7,6,SHERIFF:,That's when I got the drop on them and shot them both.
7,6,CORONER:,"Here's the files. Cause of death -- multiple gunshot wounds. I fingerprinted them first, of course, for your records."
7,6,SHERIFF:,"Their bodies were sent to the funeral home for cremation, as per their living wills and religious requirements."
7,6,SHERIFF:,"You can contact the funeral home. They might still have the bodies. As you know, once we do the autopsy, we're obliged to release --"
7,6,JODY MILLS:,That should take the heat off.
7,6,BOBBY:,"For now. Thanks, Jody. Couldn't have done it without you."
7,6,BOBBY:,"Actually, there is one more thing."
7,6,BOBBY:,"Don't open it. Even if it starts talking. Especially if it starts talking. When you cross over Underhill Bridge, just toss it in the drink. If you'll excuse me, I, um...I got a body to bury in cement."
7,6,CORONER:,"Dad, seriously? Lying to the FBI, incinerating bodies, and this stuff? What the hell is it? 'Cause it sure isn't blood."
7,6,SHERIFF:,I can explain.
7,6,CROWLEY:,Mr. Roman.
7,6,CROWLEY:,I felt it was time we met in person. I'm Crowley. I run Hell.
7,6,MR ROMAN:,"Yes, yes. Of course. I agree, 100%. High time we met."
7,6,CROWLEY:,A token.
7,6,MR ROMAN:,You shouldn't have. I love a muffin.
7,6,CROWLEY:,100% organic baby uvulas – gluten free.
7,6,MR ROMAN:,So considerate.
7,6,CROWLEY:,"I'll cut to the chase, Mr. Roman."
7,6,MR ROMAN:,Please. Dick.
7,6,CROWLEY:,"Dick. You and I control large interests that I feel strongly could meld, to the benefit of all."
7,6,DICK ROMAN:,You think?
7,6,CROWLEY:,"I know. Straight talk – we should be friends, you and I."
7,6,DICK ROMAN:,Why? Why in the world would we be?
7,6,CROWLEY:,"Well, I brought you here... Dick. I found the way to open the door to Purgatory."
7,6,DICK ROMAN:,"To steal every last soul, you mean. You and that angel friend of yours. Don't roofie me and call it romance."
7,6,CROWLEY:,I think you've got me wrong.
7,6,DICK ROMAN:,"Now it's your turn to listen. I'd sooner swim through hot garbage than shake hands with a bottom-feeding mutation like you. You demons are ugly, lazy, gold-digging whores. You're less than humans, and they're not good for much till you dip 'em in garlic sauce. I'd never work with you, Crowley. In fact, if I wasn't busy with better things, I might actively wipe your kind from the face of the Universe. And you'd deserve it. Are we clear?"
7,6,CROWLEY:,Keep the muffins.
7,6,DEAN:,Are you sure you want to dump these things? I'm thinking they might actually come in handy down the road. What do you think?
7,6,DEAN:,Hey. What? What is it? Talk.
7,6,SAM:,Nothing.
7,6,DEAN:,"Well, that's convincing. Did monster-us give you the jeebs, huh? 'Cause I gotta be honest – I ain't looking in the mirror for – for a while myself."
7,6,SAM:,Okay. You really want to know what's wrong?
7,6,DEAN:,"Yeah. Yeah, you know my – here to help."
7,6,SAM:,"""Here to help."" Kind of like you helped Amy?"
7,6,DEAN:,"Listen, Sam..."
7,6,SAM:,"Don't – don't lie to me again. No, don't even talk to me. Yeah, I can't."
7,6,SAM:,"You know what, Dean?"
7,6,SAM:,I can't.
7,6,DEAN:,You can't what?
7,6,SAM:,I can't talk to you right now! Dean...
7,6,SAM:,I can't even be around you right now!
7,6,DEAN:,"Okay, so—"
7,6,SAM:,I think you should just go on without me.
7,6,SAM:,Go.
7,6,DEAN:,"All right. Sorry, Sam."
7,7,MEDIUM:,"Yes. A spirit has gathered around us. Are you with us, spirit?"
7,7,WOMAN:,I feel something. I have goose bumps. Uncle Danny?
7,7,MEDIUM:,We're going to make contact now. Rest your hands on the planchette.
7,7,MEDIUM:,Let the spirit guide our hands.
7,7,MEDIUM:,"O spirit, are you the one we seek? Are you... Uncle Danny?"
7,7,WOMAN:,I'm not doing that.
7,7,MAN:,Yeah. She's pushing it.
7,7,MEDIUM:,It's okay to be skeptical.
7,7,MEDIUM:,"Danny, if you're with us, knock twice for yes."
7,7,WOMAN:,"Danny? Can you ask him, is he happy?"
7,7,MEDIUM:,He is. He's happy.
7,7,WOMAN:,Is Sadie with him?
7,7,MAN:,"Now you're being ridiculous, Cynthia. Who cares about Sadie?"
7,7,MEDIUM:,"Ah, yes. I see... A family pet."
7,7,CYNTHIA:,That's her. Sadie was a Schnauzer.
7,7,MEDIUM:,"She's with Danny, chasing tennis balls in the afterlife."
7,7,CYNTHIA:,Sadie loved tennis balls.
7,7,MAN:,There were important papers. No one can find them. They weren't in the safe. Can you just ask him...
7,7,MEDIUM:,Of course. I'll need you to place your hands with me on the planchette.
7,7,MEDIUM:,Maybe – maybe Danny didn't like the question.
7,7,MAN:,Tell him to quit fooling around. He knows darn well that's my money.
7,7,CYNTHIA:,"Can't you two stop squabbling? For Pete's sake, he's dead. Tell him we're sorry. Maybe if we're nice, he'll –"
7,7,CYNTHIA:,"Oh, my God. Danny?"
7,7,CYNTHIA:,What's going on?
7,7,DEAN:,Geez. Have some pride.
7,7,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,7,DEAN:,"The hell I am, ass-hat."
7,7,DEAN:,O spirits of the further... am I going to win the Powerball?
7,7,DEAN:,I'm gonna be rich!
7,7,WAITER:,Hello! First time at Good Graces?
7,7,DEAN:,Yes.
7,7,WAITER:,"Well, we're 100% locally sourced, biodynamic, and you get a free affirmation with every order."
7,7,DEAN:,Think I'll source a taco joint.
7,7,WAITER:,All right.
7,7,SAM:,"Just coffee, black, extra shot."
7,7,DEAN:,You always wear a suit to get your palm read?
7,7,DEAN:,Yeah. Not surprised you caught this one. It's on every morning zoo in America. You mind?
7,7,DEAN:,"So, I, uh, I went to the scene. Wires, speakers, enough E.M.F. to make your hair stand up. Don't even think about getting a reading. Oh, and, uh, if this hadn't have been two psychics that bit it... I would have just chalked this up as being, uh, dumb and accidental. And I know, I know. This whole town's supposedly calling ghosts. But that takes some serious spellwork and some serious mojo. The only books this lady had were Oprah crap. When was the last time you actually saw a real psychic? Huh? Pamela? Missouri? Anyway, this [DEAN gestures towards SAM] is good. And, uh, how you been?"
7,7,WAITER:,And what can I get for you?
7,7,DEAN:,"Uh, pancakes, side of pig. Coffee, black."
7,7,WAITER:,Fantastic. You are a virile manifestation of the divine.
7,7,DEAN:,What the hell did he say to me?
7,7,DEAN:,"Oh, it's funny? Yeah, no. Go ahead. Laugh it up, Sam. Hilarious."
7,7,SAM:,Dean...
7,7,DEAN:,"Oh, he speaks."
7,7,SAM:,Look...
7,7,DEAN:,"Sam. Look, we're both here. All right, the chance of either one of us leaving while people are still dying out there—"
7,7,DEAN:,You might as well bite the bullet and work with me on this one.
7,7,SAM:,I don't know if I can.
7,7,DEAN:,"I'm not asking you to open up a can of worms, okay, I'm not even asking you where the hell you've been for the past week and a half."
7,7,SAM:,Good.
7,7,DEAN:,"I'm just saying, let's try and stop the killings. That's it."
7,7,SAM:,Okay.
7,7,DEAN:,Okay? Good.
7,7,DEAN:,Can I help you?
7,7,WOMAN:,You're the brothers from the—
7,7,SAM:,"Oh, no, no, no, no. The Winchester guys on the news a couple weeks back? No – we get that a lot."
7,7,DEAN:,"Yeah, no. Those depraved killers got put down like the dogs that they were. Us on the other hand, we're completely harmless."
7,7,WOMAN:,"Oh, yeah! I'm sorry. Silly me. And I can see by your energies, you're completely gentle."
7,7,MAN:,"Excuse my friend. She's excitable. Sweetheart, look at them, hmm? They're FBI."
7,7,WOMAN:,Oh!
7,7,MAN:,I'm Russian. We can spot the law. You must be here about the tragedies.
7,7,WOMAN:,"Oh, we're just beside ourselves about what happened."
7,7,DEAN:,"Yeah. And so close to festival season, huh?"
7,7,WOMAN:,Yeah – no—
7,7,MAN:,"Of course we are worried. We have no idea what's going on, huh?"
7,7,MAN:,Nikolai. Let me know if I can help you. I'm highly intuitive.
7,7,SAM:,"Nikolai Lishin, spoon bender?"
7,7,NIKOLAI:,Mm. World famous.
7,7,NIKOLAI:,"Come to my demonstration at the festival, huh?"
7,7,NIKOLAI:,I teach you to harness the power of your mind.
7,7,NIKOLAI:,"Come, let's leave them be."
7,7,DEAN:,"So glad we decided to vacation here, huh? Right?"
7,7,SAM:,All right. Here we go. First death... second death.
7,7,DEAN:,What am I looking at?
7,7,SAM:,"Well, see this? Now, this is Imelda Graven, death number one. She was brained by her own crystal ball."
7,7,DEAN:,"Bummer, and ironic."
7,7,DEAN:,Same necklace?
7,7,SAM:,"Yeah. See, Imelda gave it to Goldy in her will."
7,7,DEAN:,"Okay, so, cursed object, maybe?"
7,7,SAM:,"Worth looking into. Goldy's next of kin lives in town, also a psychic."
7,7,DEAN:,"Oh, good. I haven't had my fill."
7,7,SAM:,He broke my spoon.
7,7,DEAN:,Melanie Golden? Hi. Uh...Got a minute?
7,7,MELANIE'S FRIEND:,You want me to stay?
7,7,MELANIE:,"No, that's okay."
7,7,MELANIE'S FRIEND:,Okay.
7,7,MELANIE:,"Thanks for stopping by, hon."
7,7,MELANIE'S FRIEND:,Of course.
7,7,MELANIE:,"A friend. She just heard about my grandmother... which is, I guess, why you guys are here, so come on in."
7,7,MELANIE:,Sorry. I just got back.
7,7,DEAN:,You were out of town?
7,7,MELANIE:,"Yeah, I work the circuit – hotels, conventions, you know."
7,7,DEAN:,"Oh. Wait. No offense, but... you don't seem all that psychic."
7,7,MELANIE:,Why do you say that?
7,7,DEAN:,"Well, I mean, just, you know, where's all the... crystals and pyramids?"
7,7,MELANIE:,I'm off the clock. Also not psychic. What? It's an honest living.
7,7,DEAN:,"Interesting definition of ""honest."""
7,7,MELANIE:,"Well, I honestly read people. It's just less whoo-whoo, more body language. Like you two – long-time partners, but, um... a lot of tension. [Gestures to SAM.] You're pissed. [Gestures to DEAN.] And you're stressed. It's not brain surgery. It's kind of why my grandma and me didn't get along. I mean, she'd go full smoke-machine, but she still actually believed in all that stuff, so..."
7,7,DEAN:,You don't?
7,7,MELANIE:,You do?
7,7,DEAN:,I've got an open mind. You'd be surprised.
7,7,MELANIE:,Hmm.
7,7,SAM:,"I'm sorry to have to ask, b-but there's a necklace of your grandmother's."
7,7,MELANIE:,Don't have it. Everything went straight to the emporium. She had a deal with the owner.
7,7,SAM:,The emporium?
7,7,MAN:,Mmm. Mmm. You're looking... for something.
7,7,DEAN:,You're good.
7,7,SAM:,You Jimmy Tomorrow?
7,7,JIMMY:,Mm-hmm.
7,7,SAM:,We're looking for a necklace.
7,7,JIMMY:,Oh. Romantic.
7,7,SAM:,It would have come in with Grandma Goldy's effects.
7,7,JIMMY:,"Oh. Yes, yes. Now, you do know that this is the Orb of Thessaly."
7,7,DEAN:,We did not know.
7,7,JIMMY:,"Very powerful, very rare."
7,7,DEAN:,Let me guess. Very expensive.
7,7,JIMMY:,Worth every penny.
7,7,DEAN:,"Well, in that case..."
7,7,DEAN:,...we'll be taking the state's-evidence discount.
7,7,JIMMY:,What's going on?
7,7,SAM:,A murder investigation that we'd like to personally thank you for not obstructing.
7,7,JIMMY:,"You know, I give private energetic readings."
7,7,SAM:,"No, thanks."
7,7,JIMMY:,"A loss weighs on you. You're angry. It's complicated. Come see me, Agent."
7,7,DEAN:,"Thanks, Jimmy. We'll see you."
7,7,JIMMY:,"The bureau's gonna reimburse me for the necklace, right?"
7,7,DEAN:,"Oh, we'll send you a check."
7,7,JIMMY:,Right.
7,7,DEAN:,"Went a little ""Mentalist"" on you there, didn't he?"
7,7,DEAN:,All right. Next question. What's an Orb of Thessaly?
7,7,SAM:,I know one thing – it's made in Taiwan.
7,7,DEAN:,"Oh, a fake, around here. Imagine that. 'Course, that means that whatever's killing mediums is still out there."
7,7,DEAN:,He probably should have bent those with the power of his mind.
7,7,SAM:,Chief. We met at the station.
7,7,POLICE CHIEF:,"Right. Morning, Agent."
7,7,SAM:,"Morning. Uh, this is Agent Borne. So, what happened?"
7,7,POLICE CHIEF:,It's a weird one. Chest full of cutlery.
7,7,DEAN:,All right. We're gonna take a look around. Let us know if you get any leads.
7,7,DEAN:,What's the popular theory?
7,7,POLICE CHIEF:,It's a toss-up between a ghost and some sort of ogre that only attacks Russians.
7,7,DEAN:,Policing Lily Dale sounds fun.
7,7,POLICE CHIEF:,It was either this or Los Angeles.
7,7,SAM:,"So, these clairvoyants, did they give any details as to why they thought it was a ghost? Or a... Russian ogre?"
7,7,POLICE CHIEF:,"Their spirit monkey said so. Plus, apparently, this guy claims he had a vision of his own death, cutlery and all."
7,7,DEAN:,Excuse me.
7,7,MELANIE:,"I hadn't checked it until today. I mean, the only person who ever called my landline was my grandma."
7,7,SAM:,That's okay. Go on.
7,7,MELANIE:,"Look, I wouldn't put any stock in it. I mean, she was always calling me with some crazy dream she was sure was a sign, that kind of thing, but...uh, is it true Nikolai had a real vision of his death?"
7,7,DEAN:,That's what we were told.
7,7,MELANIE:,"Well, so did she – the day she died."
7,7,DEAN:,What'd she say?
7,7,MELANIE:,"Well, you can listen to it if you want. She said she was in a séance, then the lights go, it's freezing."
7,7,SAM:,"Wait, she said that? That the room got cold?"
7,7,MELANIE:,Yeah. Why? Is that important?
7,7,MELANIE:,What? What is it?
7,7,DEAN:,A ghost. The real deal.
7,7,MELANIE:,Come on. You're serious.
7,7,DEAN:,"Yeah. See, there's, uh, fake whoo-whoo crap, and there's real whoo-whoo crap."
7,7,MELANIE:,"Well, yeah, but... ghosts?"
7,7,DEAN:,"Oh, trust me. There's a lot weirder out there than that."
7,7,MELANIE:,"So ""The X-files"" is real, or you just stopped talking like an FBI agent."
7,7,SAM:,"Well, um... we're not FBI agents."
7,7,MELANIE:,I need a drink.
7,7,DEAN:,I support that.
7,7,DEAN:,"You know, if this is a spirit, it ain't your average spook tied to a house. I mean, this thing is boogieing all over town."
7,7,SAM:,Not surprised.
7,7,SAM:,"I mean, how many crystal balls do you figure there are in Lily Dale?"
7,7,DEAN:,"Somewhere between 50 and, uh, all of them."
7,7,SAM:,"Well, I mean, quartz can act as an antenna for spirits, right? I mean, that's why mediums started using crystal balls in the first place."
7,7,DEAN:,"Well, that means that every storefront in town has got a ghost satellite dish."
7,7,SAM:,Exactly. And this place is packed with people summoning spirits.
7,7,DEAN:,"Yeah, but, dude, most of these guys can't even call a taxi."
7,7,SAM:,All it takes is one.
7,7,DEAN:,That's gonna be like looking for a needle in a stack of fake needles.
7,7,SAM:,"It's worse. I mean, I'll bet you anything some of these guys got real juice. I'm not talking kill-people level. I'm just saying, enough to make it complicated."
7,7,DEAN:,"I hate this town. All right, so..."
7,7,DEAN:,... what? Start hitting up the Miss Cleos?
7,7,SAM:,I was thinking split up and canvass. It's faster.
7,7,DEAN:,Right. 'Course you were.
7,7,CUSTOMER:,What is it? My brother? Is he going back to prison?
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,"[In a dramatic voice] Stay away. His curse will drag you down. Folks do turn jail into a habit, you know?"
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,"[In a dramatic voice] Oh, no, no. Don't fret. I's always say, family... is a pain in the ass anyhow!"
7,7,CUSTOMER:,"Thank you, Sister Thibodeaux."
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,"[In a dramatic voice] No, child. Thank the spirits. Now, will that be cash or credit?"
7,7,MELANIE:,"It's okay. Like I said on the phone, he can help."
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,"[In a normal voice] Phony lawman, huh?"
7,7,DEAN:,"Yeah, 'cause nobody can relate to phony around here."
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,"Well, if you can do something, I don't care if you call yourself the Pope."
7,7,DEAN:,"All right. What happened, exactly?"
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,"What happened is, I had a friggin' vision. Something is coming for me."
7,7,DEAN:,What's coming? Did you get a look?
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,No. But I sure felt it when it started breaking my bones. I don't want to die.
7,7,DEAN:,Okay. We'll figure it out. The vision happened in here?
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,"Yeah, by the cash box."
7,7,DEAN:,There any chance good-lookin' was watching?
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,What was that?
7,7,MELANIE:,What the hell?!
7,7,MELANIE:,"Oh, my God."
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,"Oh, my God!"
7,7,MELANIE:,"W-was that, I mean, an actual—"
7,7,DEAN:,"Bona fide. Yeah. Well, no offense, but nobody's having psychic visions around here. This, uh, spirit, whoever she is, is giving them out."
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,And then killing people?
7,7,DEAN:,"Until we stop her. Well, the good news is you said you saw a clock and it read 2 a.m., so that gives us a little time. Now, does anybody recognize this chick?"
7,7,MELANIE:,"You know, I swear I've seen her, like in a painting or something."
7,7,DEAN:,"A painting? Like, a—"
7,7,MELANIE:,"No, not a painting. In one of those old photos in the museum."
7,7,MUSEUM GUIDE:,"Lily Dale has long been a haven for the psychically gifted. Tortured elsewhere, they're embraced here. My own family has a modest natural gift. We also celebrate our long and colorful history of... embellishers."
7,7,MUSEUM GUIDE:,"Ectoplasm illusion, circa 1890."
7,7,MUSEUM GUIDE:,"Walking, walking. Now as you may know, ectoplasm..."
7,7,MUSEUM GUIDE:,...comes from the Greek “ecto”...
7,7,MUSEUM GUIDE:,Never ended well for the siblings.
7,7,DEAN:,Why is that?
7,7,MUSEUM GUIDE:,"Mm, the strain of working together, or maybe just being around each other all their lives. Those two were the exception, actually – the Campbells. Got along famously. Of course, that was just a stage name. They weren't actually brothers. That was a cover for their, um... alternative lifestyle. Any other questions I can answer?"
7,7,SAM:,Yes. Who are they?
7,7,MUSEUM GUIDE:,"Oh, the Fox sisters – among the founders of Lily Dale. Kate Fox – quite troubled, apparently, but mesmerizing onstage. She's said to be able to levitate objects and foretell one's death."
7,7,MUSEUM GUIDE:,"Her older sister, Margaret – perhaps not a natural psychic."
7,7,DEAN:,"So, full of crap."
7,7,MUSEUM GUIDE:,"Yes, well... she didn't have her sister's charisma, but she looked after Kate. Sometimes, one's true gift is taking care of others."
7,7,DEAN:,"So, what happened to them?"
7,7,MUSEUM GUIDE:,Lived here all their lives.
7,7,SAM:,Lived here and died here?
7,7,MUSEUM GUIDE:,"Yes, well... buried in the cemetery."
7,7,SAM:,Great. That was very educational. Thank you. Dean.
7,7,MUSEUM GUIDE:,"I’m sorry, I don't normally do this during business hours, but do you know an Eleanor... or an Ellen? She seems quite concerned about you. She wants to tell you – pardon me – if you don't tell someone how bad it really is, she'll kick your ass from beyond. You have to trust someone again eventually."
7,7,MUSEUM GUIDE:,"Anyway, don't forget to visit the gift shop."
7,7,SAM:,"All right. Hit up the graveyard, dig up Kate?"
7,7,DEAN:,All right. Wait a second.
7,7,SAM:,"All signs point to her, Dean."
7,7,DEAN:,No. Just hold on a damn minute.
7,7,DEAN:,"Enough with ""just the facts."""
7,7,SAM:,We agreed—
7,7,DEAN:,"No, we agreed to work the case. We didn't agree for you to be a dick the whole time."
7,7,SAM:,What?
7,7,DEAN:,"You're pissed, okay? And you've got a right."
7,7,SAM:,"Yeah, damn straight."
7,7,DEAN:,But enough's enough.
7,7,SAM:,"Says who? Look, I'll work this damn case, but you lied to me, and you killed my friend."
7,7,DEAN:,"No, I put down a monster who killed four people, and if you didn't know her, you'd have done the same thing."
7,7,DEAN:,"Yeah, which is why you couldn't do it."
7,7,DEAN:,"Look, I get it. There are certain people in this world, no matter how dangerous they are, you just can't."
7,7,SAM:,"Don't pull that card! That's bull. Look, if I've learned one thing, it's that if something feels wrong, it probably is!"
7,7,DEAN:,"Usually, yeah. But killing Amy was not wrong. You couldn't do it, so I did. That's what family does – the dirty work. And I woulda told you, eventually, once I knew that this whole ""waving a gun at Satan"" thing was a one-time show. I think it's reasonable to want to know that you're off the friggin' high dive, Sam. You almost got us both killed, so you can be pissed all you want, but quit being a bitch."
7,7,SAM:,I get why she's killing people. I don't get why she's warning them.
7,7,DEAN:,"Give them a taste of the curse, maybe? It couldn't have been a joyride."
7,7,SAM:,Here we go.
7,7,DEAN:,"Sam! Back off, crazy eyes."
7,7,GHOST:,Listen to me. Why isn't anybody listening?
7,7,GHOST:,No.
7,7,DEAN:,You don't get a vote.
7,7,GHOST:,No! Stop!
7,7,GHOST:,No!
7,7,DEAN:,Nice timing.
7,7,MELANIE:,They took care of it.
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,"Okay, so... what – just go home?"
7,7,MELANIE:,I guess.
7,7,MELANIE:,"Hey, why don't you come stay with me a couple days?"
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,Thanks.
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,Just one more minute.
7,7,MELANIE:,"It's fine, hon."
7,7,MELANIE’S FRIEND:,"Oh, if you had that vision, you wouldn't want to be here either."
7,7,MELANIE:,"Camille, it's okay. Let's just go."
7,7,MELANIE:,What is it?
7,7,CAMILLE:,Call them back! Now!
7,7,CAMILLE:,Mel!
7,7,MELANIE:,Camille! Camille!
7,7,MELANIE:,Camille! No!
7,7,DEAN:,"Should have known that whole ""good sis, bad sis"" story was just showmanship crap. Oh, and it turns out that Kate was just trying to warn people about her evil bitch sister. And we burned her bones, so that's gone."
7,7,SAM:,Dean.
7,7,DEAN:,What?
7,7,SAM:,All we can do now is go stop her.
7,7,DEAN:,"That's not good enough, by a mile."
7,7,SAM:,I know. Believe me. But – can we talk about this later?
7,7,DEAN:,Hey. How you holding up?
7,7,MELANIE:,Been better.
7,7,DEAN:,"Listen, if you need for us to leave—"
7,7,MELANIE:,I need you guys to leave.
7,7,SAM:,"Sam: Okay, we will. It's just that... Look – Margaret is still out there."
7,7,MELANIE:,What do you guys need to know?
7,7,SAM:,Is there anything that stood out?
7,7,MELANIE:,"Well, um... she barely gave a crap about me. I mean, I was just in the way. She was all about getting Camille."
7,7,DEAN:,Okay. That's something.
7,7,MELANIE:,One other thing. Um... she enjoyed it. She was smiling.
7,7,DEAN:,I feel naked doing this in daylight.
7,7,SAM:,Yeah. Let's just hurry up.
7,7,DEAN:,"All right, Mags. My lighter's juiced this time."
7,7,DEAN:,Geraldo'd.
7,7,SAM:,Not good.
7,7,DEAN:,Never good.
7,7,SAM:,"Dean, if someone knew enough to take Margaret's bones, they're not kidding around. That's serious binding magic."
7,7,DEAN:,Great.
7,7,DEAN:,Psychic ghost bitch on a leash.
7,7,SAM:,We got to find those bones.
7,7,DEAN:,So we got to find the bonehead.
7,7,SAM:,"So, what? We call Bobby, see what it take to harness the power of a ghost?"
7,7,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,7,DEAN:,"Hey, Sam, you know why I'm not going to spend my money at the annual Lily Dale E.S.P. Festival and hot-dog-eating contest this year?"
7,7,SAM:,Can't imagine.
7,7,DEAN:,Because all the headliners are dead.
7,7,MELANIE:,"You know, after Nikolai... They asked Camille to take his spot. I mean, she's so popular. Was so popular."
7,7,DEAN:,"Okay, uh, all these people – would you say that they're the, uh, you know, top dogs in town?"
7,7,MELANIE:,"Well, it's not really like that."
7,7,DEAN:,"But they were all doing well. I mean, your grandma?"
7,7,MELANIE:,"She wrote a few books. Yeah, and Imelda was on ""The Nate Berkus Show"" twice, so, yeah, I guess they were doing pretty well. You think that's why she went after them?"
7,7,DEAN:,"I mean, if you had to guess, who do you think would be next in line?"
7,7,MELANIE:,"I mean, I don't know."
7,7,DEAN:,"Well, your grandma was headlining at the big hall, so who do you think they would ask to fill in for her?"
7,7,MELANIE:,Probably... me.
7,7,SAM:,Hey.
7,7,JIMMY:,Agent. Are you here with my check?
7,7,SAM:,I'm looking for someone who bought some things from you.
7,7,JIMMY:,How do you know from me?
7,7,SAM:,I'm kind of doubting they sell ash-wood altars at the Gas 'n Sip.
7,7,JIMMY:,Valid. Let me see the list.
7,7,JIMMY:,Ah. Here we go. Credit-card receipt. I assume you want the address?
7,7,SAM:,That’d be great. Thanks.
7,7,JIMMY:,It's the least I can do. I just heard about Camille Thibodeaux.
7,7,SAM:,Thanks a lot.
7,7,JIMMY:,You're welcome.
7,7,MELANIE:,You sure that'll work?
7,7,DEAN:,That should hold her off long enough for Sam to find the bones and burn them. Hopefully.
7,7,MELANIE:,Hopefully? Does it hurt 'em? Burning their bones?
7,7,DEAN:,"I never really thought about it. Probably, yeah."
7,7,MELANIE:,Good.
7,7,SAM:,Where's the altar?
7,7,INSTRUCTOR:,It's there!
7,7,SAM:,You're... not a necromancer.
7,7,INSTRUCTOR:,"This is a Lamaze class, I swear."
7,7,SAM:,I-I believe you. Sorry.
7,7,INSTRUCTOR:,Omm...
7,7,JIMMY:,"Somehow, I just knew you'd be back."
7,7,JIMMY:,"Hi, Agent. Put the skull down."
7,7,SAM:,"Okay, okay. Take it easy. Here."
7,7,SAM:,All right. That's enough.
7,7,MELANIE:,Is she gone?
7,7,DEAN:,I doubt it.
7,7,MELANIE:,"But she can't get past the line, right?"
7,7,DEAN:,Right.
7,7,SAM:,Nice binding spell.
7,7,JIMMY:,It doesn't matter. She helps me because she wants to.
7,7,SAM:,What?
7,7,DEAN:,Oh. Damn it. I hate when they do that. Get the salt. Go.
7,7,MELANIE:,Dean!
7,7,JIMMY (V-O):,Margaret and me...
7,7,JIMMY:,...are the same. We're the real thing.
7,7,JIMMY (V-O):,But guess what – sometimes the real thing just isn't...
7,7,JIMMY:,...pretty or entertaining enough.
7,7,JIMMY:,"When I show people what I'm capable of, it scares them. I can't pay my rent!"
7,7,DEAN:,Get behind me.
7,7,DEAN:,"That's as far as you go, bitch."
7,7,JIMMY:,Margaret's happy to kill for me. She likes the leash.
7,7,SAM:,You're sick.
7,7,JIMMY:,"You know what else I am? A real psychic, you dick-bag."
7,7,JIMMY:,Surprise.
7,7,MARGARET’S GHOST:,"Aw. Sorry, handsome."
7,7,SAM:,Where are the rest of the bones?
7,7,SAM:,These people don't deserve to die.
7,7,JIMMY:,"Oh, come on! Are you kidding me? I live in squalor 'cause I can't put on a show like them?"
7,7,SAM:,"Don't do this. They're in the bedroom, aren't they?"
7,7,JIMMY:,No.
7,7,JIMMY:,You're not getting in there.
7,7,MELANIE:,Dean!
7,7,MARGARET’S GHOST:,Too bad.
7,7,SAM:,Yeah.
7,7,SAM:,Dean.
7,7,WAITER:,Can I get you anything else?
7,7,DEAN:,"Uh, just a refill. And if you affirmate me, I'm gonna punch you in the face."
7,7,WAITER:,"All righty then. Coffee, coming up."
7,7,DEAN:,I can't wait to get out of this frickin' fortune cookie.
7,7,SAM:,Dean.
7,7,SAM:,"I'm gonna go, um... do something outside."
7,7,DEAN:,Hi.
7,7,MELANIE:,Hi.
7,7,DEAN:,Have a seat.
7,7,MELANIE:,"Oh, thank you."
7,7,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,7,MELANIE:,You didn't stick around so I could say thank you.
7,7,DEAN:,No reason to thank me.
7,7,MELANIE:,You saved my life.
7,7,DEAN:,"Yeah, but not your friend's."
7,7,MELANIE:,"Well... you didn't send that ghost, so... thank you for coming to kill it. You and Sam seem a little better."
7,7,DEAN:,You could tell that from the walk up?
7,7,MELANIE:,"[smiling] Take it or leave it. Also guessing you're not so keen to come visit here again, so...this is goodbye. Wish we'd met on a better week."
7,7,DEAN:,I wish I had better weeks.
7,7,MELANIE:,Oh.
7,7,DEAN:,"But, uh, hey. You never know. It's not like you can tell the future, right?"
7,7,MELANIE:,Hmm.
7,7,MELANIE:,"Well, answer's hazy. Try again later."
7,7,DEAN:,Right.
7,7,DEAN:,Hey.
7,7,SAM:,Hey.
7,7,DEAN:,That's your stuff.
7,7,SAM:,Yeah. Yeah. I figured we'd take one car.
7,7,DEAN:,Works for me. You still want to break my face?
7,7,SAM:,"No. Uh, not at this moment. Look, you know what? Um... You were right. About Amy. If she was... just any monster, I'm not sure I could have let her walk away. I don't know. I mean, I'll never know."
7,7,DEAN:,"So, what are you saying?"
7,7,SAM:,"What I'm saying is... I get why you did it. You were just trying to make sure no one else got hurt. But here's the thing. You can't just look me in the face and tell me you're fine. I mean, you're not sleeping, you drink for the record—"
7,7,DEAN:,"Oh, here we go."
7,7,SAM:,"Look, whatever. Last one to preach, I know. But... Just be honest with me. How are those the actions of someone who knows they did the right thing?"
7,7,DEAN:,You want me to be honest?
7,7,SAM:,Yeah.
7,7,DEAN:,"I went with my gut. And that felt right. I didn't trust her, Sam. Of course, ever since Cas, I'm having a hard time trusting anybody. And as far as how I been acting... I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause I don't like lying to you. You know, it doesn't feel right. So, yeah, you got me there. I been climbing the walls."
7,7,SAM:,"I know how that is. But, hey... If I learned one thing from that museum, sibling acts are tough."
7,7,DEAN:,"Oh, don't compare us to that hall of crazy."
7,7,DEAN:,We're like poster kids of functional family life compared to them.
7,7,SAM:,It's a low bar.
7,7,DEAN:,"Well, hey... grading on a curve has got me past everything since kindergarten, so don't knock it."
7,7,SAM:,Whatever you say.
7,7,SAM:,I still want to know how that guy bent my spoon.
7,7,DEAN:,"Forget it, Sam. It's Lily Dale."
7,8,WAITRESS:,"Okay, you won't believe it. People think I just say it to get a bigger tip."
7,8,DEAN:,Try me.
7,8,WAITRESS:,Fine. I'm in grad school. See? Okay? There's a look. [laughs] Okay? Stop.
7,8,DEAN:,"No, this is my ""I dig smart chicks"" look. Now, if they, uh, if they wore that, I... I wouldn't have dropped out of school."
7,8,WAITRESS:,"So, what's your deal?"
7,8,DEAN:,My deal?
7,8,WAITRESS:,"Yeah, okay. You came in here looking like somebody shot your puppy."
7,8,DEAN:,"Well, things are looking up now that your shift's over. All right. Uh, here's the deal. I have this friend. He's got this younger brother. Right? Cannon's a little loose. You know, his reactor blew a while back. It's not good. Um... My friend – he's, uh... He's kind of been sitting, waiting to see if he goes guano again."
7,8,WAITRESS:,And I assume it just hit the fan?
7,8,DEAN:,"Well, that's the thing. It didn't. The kid's all reasonable now, considering he's crazy. Well, he's – I mean, he's not crazy. He – he's starting to seem like things might be getting a little better."
7,8,WAITRESS:,"Well, that's a good thing, right?"
7,8,DEAN:,"It's a freakin' miracle. Except... when it happens during their, uh... their sacred annual pilgrimage to Vegas... and he goes off on some granola-munching hike in the desert by himself."
7,8,WAITRESS:,"Well, maybe he just needs some time alone."
7,8,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,8,WAITRESS:,We all need to face ourselves sometime.
7,8,DEAN:,Maybe he does.
7,8,WAITRESS:,Wasn't talking about him.
7,8,DEAN:,Excuse me.
7,8,From,Sammy
7,8,DEAN:,Speak of the devil. He's four blocks away?
7,8,WAITRESS:,See? Baby bro needs you after all.
7,8,SAM:,Dean. It's okay. You won't need that. Come on.
7,8,DEAN:,"I thought you were out, uh, becoming one with the land or some crap."
7,8,SAM:,You got to – come here.
7,8,SAM:,All right. Now...
7,8,DEAN:,What is this?
7,8,SAM:,"Uh, apparently, uh, pink is for loyalty."
7,8,DEAN:,"All right, so, what's the pretext? What are we – uh, wedding crashers, huh? We lookin' for some kind of siren or what?"
7,8,SAM:,"No. Nothing like that. All right, um... So, a little sudden. But life is short, so I'll keep this shorter."
7,8,SAM:,I'm in love. And I'm getting married.
7,8,SAM:,"Say something, like, uh, like, ""congratulations,"" for example."
7,8,DEAN:,What?
7,8,DEAN:,What the hell?
7,8,DEAN:,Becky?
7,8,BECKY:,Dean. I'm so glad you're here.
7,8,DEAN:,Shouldn't she ask for my permission or something?
7,8,SAM:,Y-you want her to ask for my hand?
7,8,DEAN:,How in the – How did this happen?
7,8,SAM:,"Short version? We – we – we met. We ate and – and talked and fell in love. And, you know, here we are."
7,8,DEAN:,"Yeah, I-I guess I'm all caught up. That's – okay. You know what? Ignoring everything, have you forgotten the average life-span of your hookups?"
7,8,SAM:,"Yeah, but—"
7,8,BECKY:,"But if anyone knows that, it's me. I mean, I read every book. So, open eyes, you know? Open eyes."
7,8,DEAN:,I'm gonna be sick.
7,8,SAM:,"Dean, look, it's simple. If- if something good's happening, I-I got to jump on it – now, today, uh, period."
7,8,DEAN:,"Okay, ""Dead Poets Society."" Fine. [to BECKY] No offense. [to SAM] Did you make sure she's even really—"
7,8,BECKY:,"Salt, holy water, everything. See?"
7,8,BECKY:,Not a monster. Just the right girl for your brother.
7,8,DEAN:,Ah.
7,8,BECKY:,That's it.
7,8,MAN:,The bill.
7,8,BECKY:,I got it. You two do your brother thing.
7,8,BECKY (offscreen):,"Um, do you take traveler’s checks?"
7,8,DEAN:,Really?! Superfan ninety-nine?!
7,8,SAM:,"Dean, look. Honest to God, I-I had the exact same opinion of her as you do. But when we got past the whole book thing, I found out t-that she's great and I was the dick."
7,8,DEAN:,"Yeah, you know, speaking of the whole, uh, book thing... Becky randomly shows up during Vegas week?"
7,8,SAM:,Yeah.
7,8,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,8,SAM:,"Okay, um, what are you trying to say?"
7,8,DEAN:,"I'm saying maybe she knew you were gonna be here. Maybe, uh, uh, uh, Chuck wrote about it."
7,8,SAM:,"Dean, you're paranoid."
7,8,DEAN:,"And you're in love?! It's been four days, man!"
7,8,SAM:,"You know what, Dean? You know what? Um, how about this? Becky and I are gonna go up to her place in Delaware. Um, why don't you try and wrap your dome around this, get a little supportive, then give us a call?"
7,8,BECKY:,"""First official Tweet as Mrs. Becky Rosen-Winchester!"""
7,8,SAM:,I thought we just ate.
7,8,BECKY:,Quick stop.
7,8,BECKY:,"Hi, Jocelyn."
7,8,JOCELYN:,Yes. Can I help you?
7,8,BECKY:,It's Becky. Becky Rosen.
7,8,JOCELYN:,"Ohh! ""Yechie Becky."""
7,8,BECKY:,Ha. Long time ago.
7,8,JOCELYN:,"Yechie Becky! Oh! Well, you look just the same, don't you?"
7,8,BECKY:,"I'm here to RSVP for the reunion, if it's not too late."
7,8,JOCELYN:,"No, no, there is always room for one more."
7,8,BECKY:,Actually...
7,8,BECKY:,"It's Rosen-Winchester. So mark me down ""plus one."""
7,8,BECKY:,"""Jocelyn Caruso roasted."""
7,8,BECKY:,"Hi, Guy!"
7,8,GUY:,You're back! How was Vegas?
7,8,BECKY:,It was awesome!
7,8,GUY:,Really? Really?
7,8,BECKY:,"Guy, meet my husband, Sam."
7,8,GUY:,"Hey. It's an honor to meet you, Sam."
7,8,SAM:,Thanks. You too.
7,8,BECKY:,Guy's a really good friend. We met in the erotic horror section at the novel hovel.
7,8,GUY:,"Oh, my God, Becky. Come on! TMI! Poor guy's just met me."
7,8,SAM:,"No, it's okay. Nice to meet you. Look, any friend of Becky's..."
7,8,GUY:,"Anyway, I should, uh, get back to it, or this party's not gonna happen, right?"
7,8,SAM:,Sure.
7,8,BECKY:,Guy's an event planner. Reunion season is very busy for him. Hold on one sec?
7,8,BECKY:,One more thing. You get my message?
7,8,GUY:,Of course. I thought you'd never ask. Give me a hug.
7,8,BECKY:,"I swear, if everyone had a Wiccan in their pocket, the world would be a happier place."
7,8,GUY:,"It is nothing. Blessed be, sweetie."
7,8,SAM:,Wow. Y-you look n-nice.
7,8,BECKY:,"Thanks! I was, you know... saving it."
7,8,BECKY:,To us.
7,8,SAM:,To us.
7,8,SAM:,Umm!
7,8,BECKY:,"Sam? Are you okay? Sammy, honey, what's wrong?"
7,8,SAM:,Becky? W-why am I... What am I doing here?
7,8,BECKY:,"We're celebrating, dear. Remember?"
7,8,SAM:,"Uh... yeah, yeah, of course. To us."
7,8,BECKY:,"Feeling better, honey?"
7,8,SAM:,Now that I'm with you.
7,8,DEAN:,Me being supportive. Congratulations to you and the missus.
7,8,SAM:,Thanks.
7,8,DEAN:,"It's a waffle iron. Nonstick. Yeah, you just, uh..."
7,8,DEAN:,I actually don't know how to use it. Are we good?
7,8,BECKY:,"Our first thought was crossroads demons, but there's that 10-year time frame on collecting souls."
7,8,BECKY:,"Then there's cursed object, like in ""Bad Day at Black Rock,"" but we haven't been able to connect the vics yet."
7,8,DEAN:,You're working this case... together?
7,8,SAM:,"Yeah. I know. Right? I mean, I guess all those Chuck Shurley books paid off."
7,8,DEAN:,"All right, listen, Cookie, I don't know what kind of mojo you're working, but, believe me, I will find out."
7,8,SAM:,"Dean, that's...my wife you're talking to."
7,8,DEAN:,"You're not even acting like yourself, Sam!"
7,8,SAM:,How am I not?
7,8,DEAN:,You married Becky Rosen!
7,8,BECKY:,What are you saying? I'm a witch? Or maybe I'm a siren. Ever occur to you we're just – I don't know – happy?
7,8,DEAN:,"Come on, Sam! Guy wins the lotto, guy hits the bigs. All right, obviously, uh, people's dreams are coming true in this town. Don't you think this is a little bit of a coincidence?"
7,8,SAM:,"You know what, Dean? What Becky and I have is real. And if you can't accept that, that's your problem, not ours."
7,8,DEAN:,"Or maybe she's part of it. Because for whatever reason, you're her dream. If you really do care about her, I'd be worried. Because people who do get their little fantasies or whatever seem to end up dead pretty quick."
7,8,SAM:,"You know, I went after her, Dean. Maybe that's what's bugging you – that I'm moving on with my life. I mean, you took care of me, and that's great. But I don't need you anymore."
7,8,SAM:,Hey. Uh...
7,8,SAM:,I got you a present.
7,8,BECKY:,His and hers fake IDs? Oh!
7,8,SAM:,Here. Check this out.
7,8,BECKY:,Junior salesman leapfrogs to CEO at Mutual Freedom Insurance. You think the CEO is a lead?
7,8,SAM:,"Uh, Becky?"
7,8,SAM:,This is...beautiful.
7,8,SAM:,"So, what do you think about the CEO?"
7,8,BECKY:,Let's go pretext him!
7,8,GARTH:,Hey. You Dean?
7,8,GARTH:,Hmm. I thought you'd be taller.
7,8,DEAN:,I assume Bobby filled you in on the road.
7,8,GARTH:,"He told me two things. One, he's tangling with a major-league nest up in Oregon territory. Numero dos, he said you'd be all, uh, surly and premenstrual working with me. But, hey, man, sticks and stones."
7,8,DEAN:,Think I found a case. Check the headline.
7,8,GARTH:,First things first.
7,8,GARTH:,"Oh, Marmaduke, you're crazy!"
7,8,MARSHA:,"Are you trying to humiliate me? It's Marsha with an ""s-h-a,"" not a ""c-i-a."""
7,8,GARTH:,"Hey, is that your—"
7,8,DEAN:,Yes.
7,8,GARTH:,Awkward.
7,8,DEAN:,Hi.
7,8,DEAN:,Okay. So...
7,8,SAM:,"So, uh, no point in going in. Guy's clean."
7,8,DEAN:,You sure?
7,8,SAM:,Yeah. Positive. Becky grilled him like a pro. She's a real natural.
7,8,DEAN:,Huh.
7,8,SAM:,What's with the scrawny guy?
7,8,DEAN:,Temp.
7,8,CEO:,"Throw a rock, hit a reporter these days, eh?"
7,8,CEO:,Go ahead. Shoot.
7,8,DEAN:,All right. Uh... how'd you get the gig?
7,8,CEO:,"Board came to me, asked. Said yes."
7,8,DEAN:,Just out of the blue?
7,8,CEO:,Pretty much.
7,8,DEAN:,"Huh. And, uh, any idea how the board landed on you over your supervisors?"
7,8,CEO:,"Um, they didn't say."
7,8,DEAN:,Could you tell us what specifically excited the board about your actual qualifications?
7,8,CEO:,"Say, fellas, what's with the third degree?"
7,8,GARTH:,"Oh, uh, no offense. We were just wondering if you got here by nefarious means."
7,8,DEAN:,Whoa! Garth!
7,8,GARTH:,"Oh. Uh, I-I didn't mean, of course, uh, corporate backstabbing – I'm sorry. I meant more like, uh, you know, black magic or hoodoo."
7,8,DEAN:,"Ha ha ha ha! Oh! He jokes. He's a– he's a jokester. Let's, uh, rewind. Why don't, uh, why don't you tell us what it felt like when your big dream came true?"
7,8,CEO:,"Look, on the record, it's great."
7,8,DEAN:,Off the record?
7,8,CEO:,It's not my big dream.
7,8,GARTH:,Wait. You didn't want this job?
7,8,CEO:,"Hell, no. I'm a sales guy. I was good in sales."
7,8,MARSHA:,Your secretary's an idiot. I'll be at the printers this afternoon.
7,8,CEO:,"All right, dear. See you at dinner."
7,8,MARSHA:,"Just have the idiot make a reservation. Here's a tip – remind her she works for the CEO. One more screw-up, she's fired."
7,8,GARTH:,"Your, uh, wife seems pretty stoked on the promotion, don't she?"
7,8,CEO:,"Honestly, I've never seen her happier. I have no idea how I'm gonna tell her I have to resign. The news is just gonna—"
7,8,GARTH:,Kill her?
7,8,DEAN:,Mrs. Burrows? Hi.
7,8,MARSHA:,Can I help you?
7,8,DEAN:,"Yes, we're, uh, we're doing a story on your husband's promotion. Wanted to ask you a few questions."
7,8,MARSHA:,I'm sorry. I can't today. If you schedule it with his girl...
7,8,DEAN:,"Okay, you know what? I'm trying to save you from a really bad accident."
7,8,MARSHA:,Are you threatening me?
7,8,DEAN:,No.
7,8,DEAN:,"No, I-I-I'm pointing out a pattern. Why do people keep thinking I'm threatening them?"
7,8,GARTH:,"Because it sounded exactly like a threat, dude."
7,8,DEAN:,"Look, for your own good, what did you do to get him promoted?"
7,8,MARSHA:,I have no idea what you're talking about. Now leave me alone. Or do I have to call security?
7,8,SAM:,"No, no, no, something's not adding up."
7,8,BECKY:,I'm sure we'll get a break.
7,8,BECKY:,"""As soon as we're done working, romantic honeymoon getaway."""
7,8,DEAN:,You okay?
7,8,MARSHA:,How did you know?
7,8,DEAN:,'Cause you're not the first. Come on.
7,8,GARTH:,You want to tell us what's up here?
7,8,MARSHA:,"I was having lunch with friends. This guy heard me bitching. Next thing I know, he's making me an offer."
7,8,DEAN:,An offer?
7,8,MARSHA:,"Craig's job for my soul. I know. Hilarious. I mean, what have I got to lose?"
7,8,GARTH:,"Well, there's your soul. What kind of demon deal is this? Timeline's whack."
7,8,MARSHA:,What are you talking about? Demon?
7,8,GARTH:,Let me back up here. You made a deal with a demon in exchange for your everlasting. Except those are 10-year contracts. Why's the bill coming due so fast?
7,8,DEAN:,"I don't know, but I got a bad feeling about who's next. We got to find Sam, pronto."
7,8,GARTH:,"All right, all right, all right. Uh, here's the plan. I drop this lady at my cousin's. He'll stop anything trying to get her. We, uh, find Sam, hopefully fix this, everybody's home in time for ""America's Got Talent."" Now, you – you'll be living with a tri-racial paraplegic sniper until this all blows over, okay?"
7,8,SAM:,Becky... W-what's – what's happening?
7,8,BECKY:,Don't you remember? We're married.
7,8,SAM:,"Oh, g– I'm calling Dean."
7,8,BECKY:,"Sam, do you feel concussion-y? How many fingers am I holding up?"
7,8,SAM:,Where am I? What the hell's going on?
7,8,BECKY:,Sam... Just calm down.
7,8,SAM:,"Calm down?! You hogtied me t– Becky, why – why am I not wearing any pants?"
7,8,BECKY:,They're very constricting.
7,8,BECKY:,Don't worry. I didn't do anything weird. I was helping.
7,8,SAM:,Let me go. Now!
7,8,BECKY:,"Are you thirsty? Or do you need a bottle... to, you know, tinkle? It's okay if you do. I can help."
7,8,BECKY:,Finally!
7,8,SAM:,"Wait. What? Wait. Becky? Becky. Hey, hey, don't! Don't! Becky!"
7,8,BECKY:,Where have you been?
7,8,BECKY:,"Big problem. I'm at my parents' cabin. I've got Sam tied to a bed. I'm out of elixir. I need a refill, okay? This isn't the honeymoon I had in mind. Well, some of it is, but not in this context. And is it just me, or is this stuff wearing off faster and faster?"
7,8,BECKY:,"Do you know we haven't even consummated our marriage? We were taking it slow 'cause true love is forever, but everything just feels weird now."
7,8,SAM:,So you dosed me with a love potion.
7,8,BECKY:,How—
7,8,SAM:,Thin walls.
7,8,BECKY:,"Look... Yes, I used a social lubricant to—"
7,8,SAM:,You roofied me!
7,8,BECKY:,A roofie? I'd never. We had a great time together. You were happy.
7,8,SAM:,"Oh, yeah."
7,8,SAM:,I'm thrilled.
7,8,BECKY:,I have to go.
7,8,SAM:,"You know your pal Guy is the one icing all those people, right?"
7,8,BECKY:,"No, he's not."
7,8,SAM:,"Oh, so he's not a witch?"
7,8,BECKY:,"No. He's just a Wiccan. Wiccans are good, like Glinda of Oz."
7,8,SAM:,"You're not this stupid, Becky."
7,8,BECKY:,Whatever is killing people... it's something else.
7,8,SAM:,"It's never something else. When are there ever two crazy things in town at the same time? Guy's the creep, and you're on his list."
7,8,BECKY:,No. He's my friend.
7,8,SAM:,"No, he's your dealer. Look, I don't know how much he's charging you for that Spanish Fly—"
7,8,BECKY:,"Nothing! He gives it to me. And he said it wouldn't even work unless you already loved me, deep down. It just activates it."
7,8,SAM:,So you think I love you?
7,8,SAM:,Then untie me.
7,8,SAM:,[muffled] No. No!
7,8,BECKY:,You're still working through your emotions.
7,8,SAM:,[muffled] Becky!
7,8,BECKY:,"I love you, too!"
7,8,GUY:,"[to waiter] On the table, next to the nametags."
7,8,BECKY:,Guy.
7,8,GUY:,Why don't you take a seat?
7,8,GUY:,Tough day? Okay. We can cut right to it if you like.
7,8,GUY:,Ah. Let's talk price.
7,8,BECKY:,What?
7,8,GUY:,"Well, we're a little past the freebie stage, don't you think?"
7,8,BECKY:,But I thought we were besties.
7,8,GUY:,"Ohh, honey. That is so depressingly ""Becky."" I mean, it's – you're so pathetic, it actually loops back around again to cute."
7,8,BECKY:,"Okay. You want me to pay, fine. Do you accept personal checks?"
7,8,GUY:,No. But I will take your soul.
7,8,BECKY:,You're a crossroads demon.
7,8,GUY:,"Bingo, bango! I love reunions. The desperation! These schlubs will sign on the dotted line for money, power, hair – whatever it takes to impress the nostalgically bangable head cheerleader."
7,8,BECKY:,Sam was right. You killed those people.
7,8,GUY:,"But for legal reasons, let's just say they had... unfortunate accidents."
7,8,BECKY:,"So, what, I hand over my soul, and the next day a piano falls on my head?"
7,8,GUY:,"No, I'd never do that to you. I promise."
7,8,BECKY:,I'm not stupid.
7,8,GUY:,But you are special.
7,8,BECKY:,I am?
7,8,GUY:,"Hey. I wasn't thrilled to see your new hubby was Sam freakin' Winchester. I mean, if he knew that I was here talking to you, I mean, he'd probably—"
7,8,BECKY:,Gank your ass.
7,8,GUY:,"Yes! And I'm very protective of my ass. It's one of my best features. Becky, I'm prepared to offer you a one-time-only deal. Not ten years. Twenty-five. No pianos, guaranteed. Just Sam."
7,8,BECKY:,For my soul.
7,8,GUY:,"And your promise to not breathe a word about this to the Winchesters, and I'll be on my merry way. No one gets a deal like this, Becky. Not kings, not popes. I snap my fingers, and Sam will love you for the rest of your life."
7,8,BECKY:,I think I'll have that drink now.
7,8,DEAN:,Anything?
7,8,GARTH:,"Uh, she's got 11 Twitter...ers. Last post – ""Going on romantic trip with hubster!!!"" Three exclamation points. I guess she got excited."
7,8,DEAN:,That look romantic to you?
7,8,GARTH:,"Oh, hell, no. But I got this thing about fish. Dead eyes, man."
7,8,DEAN:,Huh.
7,8,BECKY:,Well... this is not how I imagined spending my reunion.
7,8,BECKY:,"I was gonna show you off – not that anyone actually knows who you are. ""Supernatural"" is not exactly popular, but... you're tall... and nice and... they'd all think I was happy."
7,8,BECKY:,You're mad. I get it. But...
7,8,BECKY:,Can we talk?
7,8,SAM:,"[muffled] Oh, God."
7,8,BECKY:,I know you don't love me.
7,8,SAM:,"[muffled] Yeah, you got that right."
7,8,SAM:,What?
7,8,BECKY:,"I mean, not that you're a loser, but you had that whole character arc about being a freak, and... I can relate."
7,8,SAM:,"[muffled] Oh, my God."
7,8,BECKY:,"Honestly... The only place people understood me was the message boards. They were grumpy and overly literal, but at least we shared a common passion. And I'll take it, you know? Then I met you guys – the real Sam and Dean. And I started dating Chuck."
7,8,BECKY:,"And everything was... amazing. But you left, and Chuck dumped me. I think I intimidated him with my vibrant sexuality."
7,8,BECKY:,I just want someone who loves me for me! Is that too much to ask?
7,8,BECKY:,What?
7,8,SAM:,"If you want somebody to love you for you, maybe don't drug them."
7,8,BECKY:,But I want you! And this is the only way!
7,8,SAM:,"Becky. Becky, you're better than this."
7,8,BECKY:,"That's sweet, but... I'm not so sure."
7,8,GUY:,Becks! You missed the party.
7,8,BECKY:,Yeah. Well... weird night.
7,8,GUY:,"So, what are we thinking?"
7,8,BECKY:,Okay. I'm in.
7,8,GUY:,You're making the right choice.
7,8,BECKY:,I know. So... we seal the deal with a kiss?
7,8,GUY:,"Exactly. Pucker up, sweetheart."
7,8,BECKY:,I'm not your sweetheart!
7,8,GARTH:,Blueberry vodka. The answer to all of life's problems.
7,8,BECKY:,"You see that, Sam? I did it just like we said! I am awesome! I – I'll be over here."
7,8,GUY:,"Dean Winchester. This is really thrilling. Hey, can I have your autograph?"
7,8,DEAN:,"Sure. Yeah, I'll, uh, carve it into your spleen. So, how you running your little scam?"
7,8,GUY:,"Well, how do you mean, Dean?"
7,8,SAM:,"Signing 10-year deals, snuffing 'em that week."
7,8,GUY:,"Well, I would never. No. Rules of the road – can't lay a hair on any of my clients."
7,8,DEAN:,Right. So how you cheating it?
7,8,GUY:,"I'm not a cheater. I'm an innovator. It's called a loophole, you moron. Yes, when a person bargains away his soul, he gets a decade, technically. But accidents happen."
7,8,SAM:,"So you're arranging ""accidents"" and collecting early?"
7,8,GUY:,"Oh, please. White gloves. I don't get my hands dirty. That's why it's important to have a capable intern."
7,8,GUY:,What time did I ask you to be here? What time did I ask you to be here?!
7,8,DEAN:,"Exorcizamus te, omnis—"
7,8,SAM:,Becky...run!
7,8,BECKY:,Whoa.
7,8,DEAN:,"How many deals you got cooking in this town, Madoff?"
7,8,GUY:,Fifteen.
7,8,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, call them off, or I'll cut my own loophole in your throat."
7,8,GUY:,"Oh, crap."
7,8,DEAN:,"Yeah, you said it. You're in a world—"
7,8,CROWLEY:,"Hello, boys."
7,8,DEAN:,"Oh, crap."
7,8,CROWLEY:,"Sam, mazel tov. Who's the lucky lady?"
7,8,BECKY:,You're Crowley!
7,8,CROWLEY:,"And you're – well, I'm sure you have a wonderful personality, dear."
7,8,DEAN:,"Ah, another step, and I'll Colombian necktie your little friend here."
7,8,CROWLEY:,"Please, don't let him get off that easy."
7,8,GUY:,"Sir, I don't think that you—"
7,8,CROWLEY:,"I know exactly what you've been doing. A little birdie named Jackson [GUY glances at GUY'S INTERN, dead on the floor] sold you out, e-mailed all the juicy deets to my suggestion box."
7,8,CROWLEY:,"I assume... That's my whistle-blower? Shame. Had a future. Unfortunately, you don't."
7,8,GUY:,I was just—
7,8,CROWLEY:,"There's only one rule – make a deal, keep it."
7,8,GUY:,"Well, technically, I didn't—"
7,8,CROWLEY:,"There's a reason we don't call our chits in early – consumer confidence. This isn't Wall Street! This is Hell! We have a little something called integrity. This gets out, who'll deal with us? Nobody! Then where are we?"
7,8,GUY:,I don't know.
7,8,CROWLEY:,"That's right. You don't. Because you're a stupid, shortsighted little prat. Now, hand the jackass over. I'll cancel every deal he's made."
7,8,DEAN:,What are you gonna do with him?
7,8,CROWLEY:,"Make an example of him. Fair trade, right? We all go our separate ways. No harm done."
7,8,SAM:,"What, out of the goodness of your heart?"
7,8,CROWLEY:,"Years of demons nipping at your heels, haven't seen one for months. Wonder why?"
7,8,DEAN:,We've been a little busy.
7,8,CROWLEY:,"Hunting Leviathan – yes, I know. That's why I told my lads to stay clear of you meatheads."
7,8,SAM:,"So, what do you know about—"
7,8,CROWLEY:,"Too much. You met that dick yet? Smuggest tub of goo since Mussolini. I hate the bastards. Squash 'em all, please. I'll stay clear."
7,8,DEAN:,Rip up the contracts first.
7,8,CROWLEY:,Done... and done. Your turn.
7,8,GUY:,"No, no, no, no. Let—"
7,8,CROWLEY:,"Pleasure, gentlemen."
7,8,GARTH:,What'd I miss?
7,8,BECKY:,"It... it wasn't all bad, right?"
7,8,SAM:,"Okay, y-you did save my life, and for that, thanks."
7,8,BECKY:,"So, I'll see you again?"
7,8,SAM:,"Yeah, probably not."
7,8,SAM:,"Becky, look. You're not a loser, okay? You're a good person, a-and you've got... a lot of... e-energy. So, you know, just do your thing, whatever that is, and the right guy will find you."
7,8,DEAN:,"Well, buddy, I got to say, man – you, uh... you don't suck."
7,8,GARTH:,Thank you. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. Well...
7,8,DEAN:,"Oh. Yeah. All right, that's – thank you."
7,8,DEAN:,Take care. (to SAM) Wow.
7,8,SAM:,"Aww, you made a fwiend."
7,8,DEAN:,Uh-uh.
7,8,SAM:,"Look, man, uh... When I was all dosed up, I-I said some crap."
7,8,DEAN:,"Oh, you mean, she – she wasn't your soulmate?"
7,8,SAM:,"Shut up. I mean, I do need you watching my back. Obviously."
7,8,DEAN:,"Yeah, when, uh, crazy groupies attack."
7,8,SAM:,You know what I mean.
7,8,DEAN:,"You know, I got to say, man... For a whack-job, you really pulled it together."
7,8,SAM:,"That's the nicest thing anyone's said to me. Look, don't be too impressed, man. It's still a Denver scramble up here. I just know my way around the plate now."
7,8,DEAN:,I'm just saying. It's stupid to think that you need me around all the time. You're a grown-up.
7,8,SAM:,Right.
7,8,DEAN:,"You're a hike-in-the-desert, hippie-douche grown-up."
7,8,SAM:,"Dude, I was camping. You camp."
7,8,DEAN:,"Yeah, whatever. Hippie."
7,8,SAM:,"You know what, though? Seriously? It might be nice."
7,8,DEAN:,What?
7,8,SAM:,"I mean, you basically have been looking out for me your whole life. Now you finally get to take care of yourself. About time, huh?"
7,8,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,8,DEAN:,Right.
7,9,MAN:,"Good night, sweetie."
7,9,MAN:,What the hell? Leanne!
7,9,MAN:,No. No. Stay away. Leanne!
7,9,SAM:,Did you strip enough wire?
7,9,DEAN:,"Yes, I stripped enough wire."
7,9,SAM:,All right.
7,9,DEAN:,See? Told you.
7,9,BOBBY:,"Well, isn't this cozy?"
7,9,SAM:,"Yeah. Well, Motel 6 just ain't leaving the light on anymore."
7,9,BOBBY:,"Well, I'm taking a page out of Frank Devereaux's Bible on this. Everybody's out to get you -- paranoia is just plain common sense."
7,9,DEAN:,"Weeks, guys. Weeks. We've been living with cold showers, cold Hot Pockets, cold freaking everything. I mean, this is the bottom that we're living in. You guys get that, right?"
7,9,BOBBY:,"How many big mouths are out there, running card traces, like Chet, or hunting us down God knows what ways? No, now's not the time to be laying our bed rolls out on the grid. Not if we can help it."
7,9,DEAN:,"That's just great. This is stupid. Our quality of life is crap. We got Purgatory's least wanted everywhere, and we're on our third ""The World's Screwed"" issue in, what, three years? We've steered the bus away from the cliff twice already."
7,9,SAM:,Someone's got to do it.
7,9,DEAN:,What if the bus wants to go over the cliff?
7,9,SAM:,You think the world wants to end?
7,9,DEAN:,"I think that if we didn't take its belt and all its pens away each year that, yeah, the whole enchilada woulda offed itself already."
7,9,BOBBY:,"Stop trying to wrestle with the big picture, son. You're gonna hurt your head."
7,9,BOBBY:,"So, what's the guff?"
7,9,SAM:,"Well, uh, there’ve been a rash of sightings all over the southern pine barrens -- a strange, fast-moving, human-like creature. Locals even have a name for it."
7,9,BOBBY:,The Jersey Devil? I thought that was just local tall-tale crap.
7,9,SAM:,"The area's history of sightings goes back more than two centuries. Some accounts gave it bat wings, others horns, a...a tail."
7,9,SAM:,"And, uh, oh yeah, a horse's head."
7,9,DEAN:,"Of course, the sketch looks more like a Chewbacca head."
7,9,BOBBY:,Sounds kind of mixed up.
7,9,DEAN:,"Yeah, kind of like it should be fighting a Japanese robot."
7,9,SAM:,"Well, mixed up or not, it sounds like it might just have a body count."
7,9,BOBBY:,"""Camping high season harshed by human burrito""?"
7,9,SAM:,"Yeah. Something hung a camper up in a tree, then ate him alive right through his sleeping bag. His wife hasn't been seen, either. Plus, there have been four other missing persons reported in the last three weeks. State troopers -- get this -- are saying it's a rogue bear."
7,9,DEAN:,"Yeah, of course, when was the last time you saw a bear string up its own piñata?"
7,9,BOBBY:,"Something's out there in the woods. Hey, we're going honest to goodness wilderness hunting. I haven't used my .30-30 in a while."
7,9,DEAN:,"Okay, Davey Crockett, well, safari's gonna have to wait till tomorrow and after our suit-and-tie dance. We'll make sure this is not just some backwoods crackhead who likes to roll glampers."
7,9,BOBBY:,What the hell's a glamper?
7,9,DEAN:,Sam?
7,9,SAM:,"High-end camper. TV, A.C., Wi-Fi. Back to nature, zero inconvenience."
7,9,BOBBY:,That's idiotic.
7,9,SAM:,Yeah. Some people just don't know how to live.
7,9,DEAN:,"So, Ranger Evans –"
7,9,RANGER:,"Oh, uh, you can call me Rick. Ranger Rick."
7,9,DEAN:,"Uh, you were the one who found Mitchell Rayburn, correct?"
7,9,RANGER RICK:,The human burrito.
7,9,SAM:,State police have it down as a bear attack.
7,9,RANGER RICK:,"[laughs] Yeah, I read what the state police says. That was no rogue brown."
7,9,DEAN:,"Apparently, some others reported seeing something a little, you know, weirder."
7,9,RANGER RICK:,"You know, I've been a ranger for 12 years. Tell you the truth, we have no idea what's out there. Big. Lot of trees and whatnot. Tell you this, though. You got to respect Mother Nature. You respect her, or she's gonna string you up, and she'll eat your ass right through the Gore-Tex."
7,9,DEAN:,So you're thinking it's Mother Nature?
7,9,RANGER RICK:,"See, me and Phil, we've been finding, uh, something's leftovers for weeks -- deer remains, badger, missing pets."
7,9,SAM:,Who's Phil?
7,9,SAM:,But you think maybe your assistant chief ranger might be missing?
7,9,RANGER RICK:,I should probably report that.
7,9,DEAN:,"Oh. Excuse us. Well, you, uh... enjoy your lunch... Ranger Rick."
7,9,DEAN:,So?
7,9,BOBBY:,"Well, I took a look at the cadaver -- what's left of it. Not a happy camper. Don't have any stats on a Jersey Devil, but the bite radius on the vic's wounds -- it's too small for a Leviathan. And he's still got a ventricle and some change, so I doubt we're talking werewolf. And a wendigo don't leave no scraps."
7,9,DEAN:,Hmm. Lunch?
7,9,BOBBY:,Starving.
7,9,DEAN:,"Hey! Uh, Brandon. We grab a booth?"
7,9,BRANDON:,"Hey, uh, douchewad, a hostess will seat you. Do I look like a freaking hostess?"
7,9,DEAN:,Do you want to look like a hostess?
7,9,SAM:,"That didn't really make sense, what you... said."
7,9,DEAN:,What was that?
7,9,BOBBY:,I sure hope we don't get Brandon's section.
7,9,BRANDON:,Sidewinder soup and salad combo goes to Big Bird.
7,9,BRANDON:,TDK slammer to Ken Doll.
7,9,BRANDON:,And a little heart-smart for creepy uncle.
7,9,DEAN:,What is your problem?
7,9,BRANDON:,You are my problem!
7,9,BOBBY:,"Oh, Brandon's got his flare all up in a bunch."
7,9,DEAN:,"Anyway, chief ranger -- I don't think he believes in the Jersey Devil."
7,9,SAM:,"Oh, oh, by the way, did he seem a little, uh, stoned to you?"
7,9,DEAN:,Ranger Rick? Yeah. Definitely growing his own on the back 40 and smoking all the profits.
7,9,SAM:,He did seem to think that there was something --
7,9,DEAN:,"[talking with mouth full] Oh, that is good sandwich."
7,9,BOBBY:,What the hell did you get?
7,9,DEAN:,New Pepperjack Turducken Slammer -- limited time only.
7,9,BOBBY:,Bunch of birds shoved up inside each other. Shouldn't play God like that.
7,9,DEAN:,"Hey, don't look at me sideways from that -- that Chinese chicken geezer salad there, okay? This is awesome. Like the perfect storm of your top-three edible birds."
7,9,SAM:,"All right, anyways, um... The ranger did seem to think there was something out in Wharton Forest."
7,9,BOBBY:,"Well, then I'd say it's safari time."
7,9,MAN:,She’s big-boned!
7,9,BRANDON:,Look at her! You're telling me she's not fat?
7,9,WAITER:,Hey.
7,9,BRANDON:,"Up yours, Mike. Shove it right up yours!"
7,9,DEAN:,"Well, anyway, back to bigger and better things."
7,9,BOBBY:,Couple of bucks. Head-butting over turf probably. Pretty sure the other fella won.
7,9,SAM:,"I guess I forgot. Before you were a hunter, you were actually a...hunter."
7,9,BOBBY:,"Yeah, well, we shot our dinner when I was a kid."
7,9,DEAN:,"You used to take us hunting. Remember? Dad had a case, he'd just dump us on you. Shoot, you must have taught us most of the outdoor tracking we know."
7,9,BOBBY:,"Yeah, what I could get to stick. I never could get you little grubs to pull a trigger on a single deer."
7,9,DEAN:,"You’re talking about Bambi, man."
7,9,BOBBY:,"You don't shoot Bambi, jackass. You shoot Bambi's mother."
7,9,DEAN:,"Well, looks like we found Phil."
7,9,RANGER RICK:,"Special agents. Listen, I got your call. But I'm not sure I got what you were saying."
7,9,RANGER RICK:,Hey. I think we found Phil.
7,9,DEAN:,That's what I said.
7,9,RANGER RICK:,"Uh, I should probably call this in."
7,9,SAM:,"Yeah, yeah. Solid move, Rick."
7,9,BOBBY:,"Ranger, I think we've got company."
7,9,RANGER RICK:,Yeah? Who's that?
7,9,SAM:,Ranger!
7,9,SAM:,Ranger Evans! Ranger!
7,9,BOBBY:,It's got him up in the trees. Lights off.
7,9,DEAN:,What?
7,9,SAM:,"Wait, Bobby, you think that's really a good idea?"
7,9,BOBBY:,"Shut up, shut off, and listen."
7,9,BOBBY:,Damn thing’s eating Rick.
7,9,DEAN:,"Man, I liked Rick."
7,9,DEAN:,"Wow. Nice shot, Bobby."
7,9,SAM:,Seriously.
7,9,BOBBY:,We all got our gifts.
7,9,DEAN:,What about the rest of Ranger Rick?
7,9,BOBBY:,Ranger called in his 10-20. His own will find him. We got crap to do.
7,9,BOBBY:,"Built like a supermodel, but the thing was strong. That's for damn sure. Carried a full-grown man up a tree in nothing flat."
7,9,SAM:,"But, it only took one bullet to bring it down."
7,9,DEAN:,"And not even a silver bullet, just a bullet-bullet."
7,9,BOBBY:,First one must have just stunned it.
7,9,DEAN:,"All right, well, let's check its hulk pants for some ID."
7,9,DEAN:,"Oh, that is just gonna ruin the leather."
7,9,BOBBY:,Are you feeling okay?
7,9,DEAN:,"Yeah, I feel great."
7,9,SAM:,"Gerald Browder, uh, lived here in town, 5'9"", brown hair and blue eyes... 235 pounds."
7,9,DEAN:,Whoa.
7,9,BOBBY:,"Well, apparently, he's lost a little pudge."
7,9,DEAN:,Maybe it's a-a lap-band side effect.
7,9,BOBBY:,What the hell? I think we better have a look under Gerald's hood.
7,9,BOBBY:,God! Its organs are swimming in the stuff.
7,9,DEAN:,You guys getting hungry? I'm hungry.
7,9,SAM:,What's that?
7,9,BOBBY:,"His stomach. For a guy on a diet, Gerry here packed it in pretty good."
7,9,SAM:,That's human right there.
7,9,BOBBY:,That's fresh Rick. Let's see. Plus... a pine cone? Pack of gum in the wrapper.
7,9,SAM:,That's -- that's older. Maybe like a -- maybe Ranger Phil or the camper.
7,9,BOBBY:,What's that?
7,9,SAM:,"Looks like a -- yeah, that's a -- that's a cat's head."
7,9,BOBBY:,"A glamper or two is one thing, but you got to be damn hungry to eat a cat's head."
7,9,SAM:,Mm-hmm.
7,9,BOBBY:,"Well, lookit here. I'm no Dr. Oz, but..."
7,9,BOBBY:,I think that's his adrenal glands.
7,9,SAM:,Okay. And?
7,9,BOBBY:,Meant to be the size of hotel bar soap... and bright orange.
7,9,SAM:,"Ooh! All right, that might help explain the strength. Um, but whatever this thing is, it's not the Jersey Devil, but it sure as hell ain't Gerald Browder anymore."
7,9,DEAN:,"Okay, guys, seriously. It's time for dinner?"
7,9,SAM:,"Gerald Browder, 35, self-employed. Air-conditioning repairman."
7,9,SAM:,Missing person number three. Disappeared eight days ago.
7,9,BOBBY:,"Well, that explains all the people who got eaten in the last eight days."
7,9,SAM:,"Yeah. Question is, what happened to him?"
7,9,SAM:,"Dean. Uh, so, what do you think?"
7,9,DEAN:,[talking with his mouth full] I'm not that worried about it.
7,9,BOBBY:,Excuse me?
7,9,DEAN:,"That's funny, right? I could give two shakes of a rat's ass. Is that right? Do rats shake their ass, or is it something else? Eh."
7,9,SAM:,Give me that.
7,9,DEAN:,"Whoa, whoa! Why?!"
7,9,BOBBY:,"There's some funky chicken in the TDK Slammer, ain't there?"
7,9,SAM:,Yeah.
7,9,DEAN:,This is stupid. My sandwich didn't do anything. I don't know what you think you're gonna find.
7,9,BOBBY:,"There's something wrong with you, Dean."
7,9,DEAN:,Are you kidding? I'm fine! I -- I actually feel great. The best I've felt in a couple months. Cas? Black goo? I don't even care anymore. And you know what's even better? I don't care that I don't care. I just want my damn slammer back.
7,9,SAM:,"Dude, you are completely stoned, just like Ranger Rick was."
7,9,BOBBY:,Just like the dinner rush back at Biggerson's. And everybody's loving the Turducken.
7,9,DEAN:,I think you pissed off my sandwich.
7,9,DEAN:,That -- that's in me?
7,9,SAM:,O-only half of it.
7,9,BOBBY:,Does that snot look familiar?
7,9,SAM:,"Okay, so whatever turned Gerry Browder into a pumpkin head... and is currently turning Dean into an idiot --"
7,9,DEAN:,I'm right here. Right here.
7,9,BOBBY:,Is in the Turducken Slammer at Biggerson's.
7,9,SAM:,Yeah.
7,9,BOBBY:,It's in the meat.
7,9,DEAN:,"If I wasn't so chilled out right now, I would puke."
7,9,SAM:,How's he doing?
7,9,BOBBY:,He's sleeping it off. Tryptophan coma.
7,9,SAM:,"So, you think he's okay?"
7,9,BOBBY:,"Yeah, he's all right."
7,9,SAM:,Good. So you don't worry about him?
7,9,BOBBY:,What do you mean? Before the Turducken?
7,9,SAM:,"Yeah. Yeah, I kind of mean more like, uh... more like ever since my head broke... and we lost Cas. I mean, you ever feel like he's -- he's going through the same motions but he's not the same Dean, you know?"
7,9,BOBBY:,How could he be?
7,9,SAM:,"Right, yeah, but what if --"
7,9,BOBBY:,"What if what, Sam? You know, you worry about him. All he does is worry about you. Who's left to live their own life here? The two of you --  aren't you full up just playing Snuffleupagus with the Devil all the live long?"
7,9,SAM:,"I don't know, Bobby. Seeing Lucifer's fine with me."
7,9,BOBBY:,Come again?
7,9,SAM:,"Look, I'm not saying it's fun. I mean, to be honest with you, I-I kind of see it as the best-case scenario. I mean..."
7,9,SAM:,"...at least all my crazy's under one umbrella, you know? I kind of know what I'm dealing with. A lot of people got it worse."
7,9,BOBBY:,You always were one deep little son of a bitch.
7,9,SAM:,"Wait, wait, wait. Here we go."
7,9,BOBBY:,"Well, I guess we follow him."
7,9,SAM:,"That's weird, right? I mean, national franchise like Biggerson's getting meat from a place that looks like it wholesales Hong Kong knockoffs."
7,9,DEAN:,Okay. Yeah. It's a little weird.
7,9,SAM:,"All right, well, I guess we wait till they close up shop, go take a look around?"
7,9,BOBBY:,Hang on.
7,9,SAM:,No.
7,9,SAM:,Edgar.
7,9,DEAN:,Leviathans.
7,9,DEAN:,Son of a bitch.
7,9,BOBBY:,What the hell is going on?
7,9,EDGAR:,"Put him with the others, if you don't mind."
7,9,DR GAINES:,"Edgar. Follow me. I've been so busy with this experiment, I didn't even realize you were back. It's, uh, big stuff."
7,9,EDGAR:,I'm back because of the experiment. What's happening? You said you were refining the formula.
7,9,DR GAINES:,Yes. Absolutely. And it's going great. The absorption rate is up in lower concentrations.
7,9,EDGAR:,But it didn't solve our little issue with adverse reactions.
7,9,DR GAINES:,"Well, no. Not 100%."
7,9,EDGAR:,Burn them.
7,9,DR GAINES:,"What? But they represent crucial test data. Where the additive formula went wrong, where my initial projections failed."
7,9,EDGAR:,Dick is coming.
7,9,BOBBY:,How's your head?
7,9,DEAN:,"Well, I think the slammer's pretty much wore off. In between that and the 20 cups of coffee, I'm nicely tense and alarmed."
7,9,BOBBY:,I wasn't talking about that.
7,9,DEAN:,"Oh, Bobby, don't -- don't go all Sigmund Freud on me right now, okay? I just got drugged by a sandwich."
7,9,BOBBY:,I want to talk about your new party line.
7,9,DEAN:,Party? What are you talking about? I don't even vote.
7,9,BOBBY:,"""The world's a suicide case. We save it, it just steals more pills""?"
7,9,DEAN:,"Bobby, I'm here, okay? I'm on the case. What's the problem?"
7,9,BOBBY:,"I've seen a lot of hunters live and die. You're starting to talk like one of the dead ones, Dean."
7,9,DEAN:,"No, I'm talking the way a person talks when they've had it, when they can't figure out why they used to think all this mattered."
7,9,BOBBY:,"Oh, you poor, sorry... You're not a person."
7,9,DEAN:,Thanks.
7,9,BOBBY:,"Come on, now. You tried to hang it up and be a person with Lisa and Ben. And now here you are with a mean old coot and a van full of guns. That ain't person behavior, son. You're a hunter, meaning you're whatever the job you're doing today. Now, you get a case of the Anne Sextons, something's gonna come up behind you and rip your fool head off. Now, you find your reasons to get back in the game. I don't care if it's love or spite or a ten-dollar bet. I've been to enough funerals. I mean it. You die before me, and I'll kill you."
7,9,DEAN:,"We need to scrape some money together, get you a condo or something."
7,9,SAM:,Hey. Something's up.
7,9,BOBBY:,"Well, I'll be a squirrel in a skirt. It's Dick frigging Roman."
7,9,DEAN:,What? Who the hell is Dick frigging Roman?
7,9,TELEVISION CLIP,
7,9,REPORTER:,"Billionaire Dick Roman, seen here at a recent press conference, has been on the corporate-takeover warpath in the last several months and shows no signs of relenting."
7,9,REPORTER:,"Whether at the helm of his America's cup-winning yacht or one of his Fortune 500 companies, Roman has never shied away from the spotlight. Roman's record-breaking series of motivational seminars, ""When in Rome,"" have outsold every other money-making program on the market. A vocal member of the NRA and a steadfast supporter of the second amendment, Roman has started attracting some conservative political attention, as well."
7,9,POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:,"Roman is ruthless, but good-looking. I think he'll make a great candidate."
7,9,DEAN:,Holy crap. What the hell is that?
7,9,SAM:,"That's one of the top 50 most powerful men in America, Dean."
7,9,DEAN:,Says here top 35 as of last month. Now it's all making sense.  Remember when Crowley kept going on about hating Dick? I thought he was just being general. Pfft!
7,9,BOBBY:,"Well, if the Leviathan got to him, then that means they're playing on a much bigger board than we were thinking."
7,9,SAM:,"So what, then? I mean, we can't exactly outgun them."
7,9,BOBBY:,"No, but we got the drop on them. Means we got a chance to figure out what these guys are really doing here."
7,9,DEAN:,Whoa. Where'd you get that mother?
7,9,BOBBY:,It's on loan from Frank's big brother collection. It'll pick up vocal vibrations from window glass at half a mile. It's time to find out what these ugly bastards are up to.
7,9,DR GAINES:,"The food additive that I've introduced into the Turducken has a near-100% rate of effectiveness. Once the subject tries it, they crave more within a few hours. With the very first dose, it starts to work on their DNA, slowing their metabolism, causing weight gain, and dampening their emotional range, which makes them perfectly complacent. As you can see, they have yet to notice that grandma is no longer with us. True, if you leave out a cooked patty for more than an hour, it reverts back to a somewhat, uh, unappealing state, but I have yet to have a case of leftovers."
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"You know what I love? I mean, besides handball and a really crisp Chardonnay. I love progress. And I know that progress comes from collaboration, which is what makes moments like this so thrilling."
7,9,DR GAINES:,I am so glad to hear you say that.
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"Now, what can you tell me about your failures?"
7,9,DR GAINES:,Hmm? My...
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,The ones that went off the rails after they ate your little treats.
7,9,DR GAINES:,"I, um... They're, uh... They've been very instructive."
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"No. See, I asked for complacency. Not complacency and a 0.03% margin of hyperadrenalized cannibalism."
7,9,DR GAINES:,I will have this under control.
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"""Camping high season harshed by human burrito""? Have I ever mentioned how I feel about our little forays making the papers? But, again, collaboration.  Progress. I want to turn this little mistake into a big fat teachable moment. Will you help me with that?"
7,9,DR GAINES:,Well... yes. Of course.
7,9,WOMAN:,And I'll reschedule with the Senator for lunch Tuesday. You can deal with the archdiocese in the afternoon.
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,Fine.
7,9,DR GAINES:,"Dick, please, let me explain to you what our program has to offer."
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,No. Let me explain why we're shutting your program down.
7,9,DR GAINES:,"We're shutting it down? No, you can't --"
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,I'm shutting it down because of the one golden rule. Do you know it?
7,9,DR GAINES:,"Yes. ""Don't make the papers."" And I promise that --"
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"No, the golden rule is there's no such thing as monsters. Anything stirs their little pots to the contrary -- very bad for our plans. So, how can I use your mistake to communicate this to all your coworkers?"
7,9,DR GAINES:,"Listen, sir, I will do anything. I will give anything to make this right."
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,I know you will.
7,9,DR GAINES:,You're bibbing me?
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"Do you know what you can give us, doctor? Your example."
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"Now, Doc. It's time."
7,9,DEAN:,They got him.
7,9,SAM:,"Dean, there are at least four Leviathans out there. We don't even know how to kill one."
7,9,DEAN:,"Well, it'll be quite a shock when we walk in through the front door, won't it?"
7,9,WOMAN:,"We'll have the jet on standby at O'Hare. Thursday morning, you close on the land acquisition in Gleason."
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,Fine.
7,9,WOMAN:,And this came this afternoon.
7,9,WOMAN:,Sotheby's.
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"Outstanding! Thank you, Susan. Oh, and, Susan?"
7,9,SUSAN:,Hmm?
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"Uh, tuh-tuh."
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"No, you're not tied up. Why waste the effort? We both know that you're not gonna get past me. How's your head?"
7,9,BOBBY:,So you got Dick Roman.
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"We can have whoever we want. We could have you, for example. If you were worth the effort."
7,9,BOBBY:,"Oh, you're hurting my feelings."
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"Well, it's a hard world, Bob. It's an us-eat-dog world."
7,9,BOBBY:,What do you got there?
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,Winning bid at auction. Beautiful. Known for their peerless sighting. I imagine you appreciate guns.
7,9,BOBBY:,I'd appreciate one right about now.
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo. But I mean the machine, the idea. Just one of your species' most inspired inventions. I mean it. I really think you guys have spunk. You're like a planet of just the cutest little engines that could. But... Like the late, great, actual Dick Roman used to say to the whores he'd kick out of the presidential suite... ""cute don't quite hack it, sugar."""
7,9,BOBBY:,"Oh, let's just cut to the chase. I clearly ain't worth the extra time I'm getting here."
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,"I'm gonna eat you, Bob. Yes. But I like my meals prepared. Besides, holding on to you could pay big dividends. I bet your friends are on their way to rescue the damsel."
7,9,BOBBY:,"Nah, they're too smart. They know they don't have the numbers. It'd be suicide. I've run my race. Could die worse."
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,I'd stay in the chair.
7,9,BOBBY:,"Okay, sons of bitches. See what you're up to now. You're coming with me."
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,Sam... That is not how we communicate from a place of yes. That was bracing. Where'd you kids find this stuff?
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,Hey! That's mine.
7,9,DEAN:,Go! Go!
7,9,DICK ROMAN:,Would you stop it with that stuff?
7,9,SAM:,"Damn it, where's Bobby?"
7,9,SAM:,Bobby! Come on! Come on! Come on!
7,9,BOBBY:,Go! Go!
7,9,DEAN:,Son of a bitch! I'm glad you got in. He almost took your freaking head off.
7,9,SAM:,"Hey, Bobby, your hat."
7,9,SAM:,"Bobby? Oh, God. Bobby? Bobby?"
7,9,DEAN:,Bobby?!
7,10,SAM:,"Bobby? Bobby? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on."
7,10,DEAN:,"Sam, is he dead?"
7,10,SAM:,I’m checking.
7,10,DEAN:,Is he dead?!
7,10,SAM:,"Just drive, Dean! Bobby!"
7,10,DEAN:,"You gotta talk to me, Sam!"
7,10,SAM:,"All right, he’s breathing. There’s a pulse."
7,10,DEAN:,Keep him upright. Stop the bleeding.
7,10,SAM:,"I’m not an idiot, Dean! I know first aid for a friggin’ bullet to the head!"
7,10,SAM:,Hold on. Hold on.
7,10,DEAN:,"All right, Bobby, hang in there."
7,10,SAM:,Bobby! Just hold on!
7,10,DEAN:,"Well, I guess we found Phil."
7,10,BOBBY:,Wait a minute. Something’s not right here.
7,10,DEAN:,"Yeah, no kidding, Bobby. There’s a corpse in a tree."
7,10,BOBBY:,Something bad’s about to happen.
7,10,DEAN:,"Yeah, well danger’s kinda on the W2 – that’s why we got the guns."
7,10,BOBBY:,Or something bad’s happened already.
7,10,BOBBY:,Balls.
7,10,SAM:,Y-you want to tell us what’s going on?
7,10,DEAN:,"Yeah, what’s going on with your head?"
7,10,BOBBY:,I got shot in it!
7,10,DEAN:,You what?
7,10,SAM:,"Bobby, we’ve been with you all day."
7,10,DEAN:,"Yeah, I think we would have noticed if you took a bullet."
7,10,BOBBY:,"I didn’t take one here. I-I took one out there, i-i-in the real world."
7,10,DEAN:,You lost us.
7,10,SAM:,"Look, Bobby, you – you want to sit down, seriously?"
7,10,BOBBY:,"No, there’s something I gotta tell you. I-I... Dammit, I can’t get at it."
7,10,SAM:,"Well, it – it’s okay, take your time. We’re – we’re right here."
7,10,BOBBY:,I didn’t have time before to tell you what...
7,10,BOBBY:,...they’re cookin’ up. You need to know.
7,10,KAREN:,Well...
7,10,KAREN:,"... you just gonna stand there or hand it over, Bobby?"
7,10,BOBBY:,What the hell? Karen?
7,10,KAREN:,You were expecting Farrah Fawcett?
7,10,BOBBY:,No. She always calls first. [pause] That’s what I said the first time this happened.
7,10,KAREN:,What are you talking about? Gimme!
7,10,BOBBY:,Oh.
7,10,BOBBY:,This  – this is just like it was. You’re beautiful.
7,10,KAREN:,Quit sweet-talkin’ and come here.
7,10,KAREN:,I feel like we haven’t talked in ages.
7,10,BOBBY:,I know just how you feel.
7,10,KAREN:,"Listen, I have something I want to say to you. No excuses this time, okay? Just sit, Bobby."
7,10,BOBBY:,I know what night this is. I remember this.
7,10,KAREN:,I’ve thought about this a lot. I really...
7,10,KAREN:,Don’t make fun of me.
7,10,BOBBY:,I wouldn’t. But right now I gotta...
7,10,BOBBY:,I don’t remember a storm coming in the night this happened.
7,10,BOBBY:,Mother Mary. I’ve got a messed-up fruitcake.
7,10,KAREN:,"What, Bobby?"
7,10,BOBBY:,"Nuthin’. I gotta go. I’m sorry, darling."
7,10,KAREN:,"Bobby, wait! Don’t go."
7,10,RUFUS:,"Number-one trick, is act like you know what you’re doing, Bobby."
7,10,BOBBY:,Rufus?
7,10,RUFUS:,"What, I can’t give you advice now? All of a sudden you know everything? You know, I can always go wait in the car."
7,10,BOBBY:,"No, wait. I – I need your help. Bad."
7,10,RUFUS:,"Yeah, damn straight you do."
7,10,BOBBY:,"No, listen to me, Rufus. I’m gonna die!"
7,10,RUFUS:,"Oh, now that’s a realistic view of the mortality rate on a ghost hunt."
7,10,RUFUS:,"Whoa, whoa, Nellie, red line. All right, baby boy, here we go."
7,10,BOBBY:,"No, Rufus!"
7,10,RUFUS:,"Are you coming, Bobby? I mean, we’re not getting any younger here!"
7,10,BOBBY:,Coming.
7,10,YOUNG BOY:,God’s gonna punish you.
7,10,MAN:,"Hello, Mr. Singer."
7,10,MAN:,Your time’s up.
7,10,BOBBY:,"So you’re my reaper, huh? You know, I’ve heard of you guy grabbing reapees in broad daylight and in their sleep, but I never heard of a reaper showing up inside a guy’s custard."
7,10,REAPER:,"You’re in a coma, genius. This is what happens. I climb in your “custard” and fish you out."
7,10,REAPER:,"Oh, you think you can lose me."
7,10,BOBBY:,Gonna try.
7,10,REAPER:,"I’ve got places to be, Singer, don’t waste my time."
7,10,BOBBY:,Might as well – while I got it.
7,10,REAPER:,You’re prolonging the inevitable.
7,10,REAPER:,I can find you anywhere! Even in this gin-soaked rat maze.
7,10,SAM:,"I'm just saying – look, you can't really compare."
7,10,DEAN:,I don’t even know you right now. There's not even a contest.
7,10,SAM:,It depends on the criteria.
7,10,DEAN:,"Survival is the only criteria, all right?"
7,10,DEAN:,"And when the crap hits the fan, it's not about who has skill. It's about who's the bigger badass. Bobby, will you please tell Sam that Chuck Norris could kick Jet Li's ass?"
7,10,DEAN:,You grab me a beer while you're in there?
7,10,WOMAN:,Bobby?
7,10,WOMAN:,"Bobby Singer, you had better be washed up when you come down."
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,"You're filthy. God, what is wrong with you? It's like you want him to get mad."
7,10,RUFUS:,"Bobby, heads-up! Whew! Poor thing. Gets left at the altar, kills herself, and then gets buried in the crypt. Now she's going after men who break their girls' hearts. Poignant, am I wrong?"
7,10,RUFUS:,"Why you out of breath? Did you go for a jog up there, man?"
7,10,BOBBY:,"I need your help, Rufus."
7,10,RUFUS:,"Yeah, clearly."
7,10,BOBBY:,"No, listen to me."
7,10,RUFUS:,"I want you to grab a torch, man. As soon as I open up her coffin, showtime's coming pretty quick."
7,10,BOBBY:,"No. Will you listen to me, you son of a bitch? There's a damn reaper coming for me."
7,10,RUFUS:,"There's a damn reaper coming for all of us, Bobby."
7,10,RUFUS:,"All right, let's put this damn ghost to bed. I got plans for Purim."
7,10,DOCTOR:,Page the neurosurgeon on call. Tell OR to put electives on hold.
7,10,DOCTOR:,Move trauma 2 to bed 7 as soon as it's clean.
7,10,NURSE:,"Gunshot wound to the right frontal area, no exit wound found. Breathing spontaneously. Respiratory rate 18 and shallow. RST at 120. BP 90 over 60. GCS 5."
7,10,DOCTOR:,Push 80 grams of Mannitol over 30. Prep for intubation.
7,10,NURSE:,Air entry clear to bases.
7,10,DOCTOR:,Let's get a central line in here now.
7,10,SAM:,What's happening? Please just tell us –
7,10,DOCTOR:,Get them out of here.
7,10,NURSE:,Sorry. You need to stay out of their way.
7,10,DEAN:,That's our uncle.
7,10,NURSE:,You got to stay back.
7,10,SAM:,What are they doing?
7,10,NURSE:,We need to get him stable.
7,10,DEAN:,"Okay, when are you gonna take the bullet out?"
7,10,NURSE:,"If we can get the swelling down, if it's in a place we can get to, if –"
7,10,SAM:,If he even lives that long.
7,10,BOBBY:,Forget it. I got to keep moving.
7,10,GHOST:,Heartbreaker.
7,10,DOCTOR:,Push 30 more of Mannitol over 10. CBC and 'lytes. Bolus him with 500 saline.
7,10,NURSE:,The vitals were stable two minutes ago.
7,10,DOCTOR:,"Well, he's crashing now."
7,10,RUFUS:,Bobby... Come on. You okay? Say something.
7,10,BOBBY:,Look out!
7,10,NURSE:,Blood pressure 130 over 90.
7,10,BOBBY:,"Okay, Rufus, I need you – Oh, balls. This would be the one job you damn near got yourself killed on. Well, you're gonna be useful, even if I have to carry you."
7,10,DOCTOR:,"He's, uh, stable for the moment. Just have to see."
7,10,BOBBY:,Rufus...
7,10,BOBBY:,Where the hell did you go?
7,10,BOBBY:,"Yeah, you! You, kid! Hey, what are you making like a white rabbit all over the place for, you grubby little – enough with the jump scares, kid. Who are you running from?"
7,10,BOBBY:,Wait a minute. I know you.
7,10,RUFUS:,Did you think I was dead?
7,10,RUFUS:,"Call me, all right?"
7,10,RUFUS:,"Don't sit Shiva for me yet, Bobby."
7,10,BOBBY:,"Listen – after Bridezilla took you out, do you remember what you told me about your near-death experience?"
7,10,RUFUS:,"I haven't told you nuthin’ yet. But now that you mention it, pretty sure I almost crossed over."
7,10,BOBBY:,And what did you see?
7,10,RUFUS:,"What did I see? What are you so riled up about, paco? All right, all right. I saw a hallway, uh, plaid carpet, uh, the apartment building from when I was a kid."
7,10,BOBBY:,And?
7,10,RUFUS:,"And I wanted out. I'm not dying on no damn plaid carpet. No, thank you."
7,10,BOBBY:,"So, what did you do?"
7,10,RUFUS:,"Well, obviously, Bobby, not being stupid, I started looking for the damn exit door. Y-you know, I swear that's what they mean about your life flashing before your eyes, 'cause every time I opened the door, there was another chapter inside – the good, the bad, the bloody."
7,10,BOBBY:,"So, how did you get out?"
7,10,RUFUS:,"Found the right door, obviously."
7,10,BOBBY:,"Well, how did you find it?"
7,10,RUFUS:,"Oh, simple – I went deep."
7,10,BOBBY:,Deep. Like old?
7,10,RUFUS:,"No, deep like... Crap you do not want to think about, so you bury it, you shove other crap over it, and you don't go there, ever."
7,10,BOBBY:,"So, you're telling me that the way out was through your worst memory?"
7,10,RUFUS:,"It's an important door, Bobby."
7,10,BOBBY:,"Okay, this is good."
7,10,RUFUS:,"What the hell are you going on about, anyway?"
7,10,BOBBY:,"This. I got to find the right door to get this to Sam and Dean. I'm in a coma, Rufus, right now."
7,10,RUFUS:,[laughs] Get out.
7,10,BOBBY:,"I got shot in the dunce cap, Rufus. I'm – I'm dying."
7,10,RUFUS:,You sure?
7,10,BOBBY:,Unfortunately.
7,10,RUFUS:,"I'll be a prima ballerina. Wait, wait, Bobby. Are you trying to tell me I'm just one of your better memories?"
7,10,BOBBY:,Would I make this up?
7,10,BOBBY:,Okay. I got to go.
7,10,RUFUS:,What?
7,10,BOBBY:,"You're coming with me, Rufus."
7,10,RUFUS:,What?
7,10,BOBBY:,I need my partner on this. Please.
7,10,RUFUS:,"Aim for your worst memory. Think. Focus. You got it? The worst, okay?"
7,10,BOBBY:,I got a metric ton of worst.
7,10,RUFUS:,"Just take a shot. By the way, killer bride – how come she call you a heartbreaker, anyway? I mean, you a family man if I ever saw one."
7,10,BOBBY:,Thanks for narrowing things down.
7,10,KAREN:,"I can't believe you. I hate you. Everything's a lie. Our whole life, our vows... everything. You knew I wanted kids. Why didn't you just sit me down and say... I don't understand. You're a good man. You'd be a good dad. What does that even mean, you break everything you touch?! What kind of excuse is that?!"
7,10,KAREN:,Aah!
7,10,KAREN:,"Just stay away from me! You broke my heart, Bobby! You happy? Just go away!"
7,10,BOBBY:,Just so you know... I'm sorry. I never stopped being sorry.
7,10,RUFUS:,"Bobby, I thought you'd want a gang of rugrats."
7,10,RUFUS:,"So, how long after this..."
7,10,BOBBY:,"...did she get possessed? Three days. Biggest regret of my life, this fight. You'd think it was when I had to stab her to death, but... no. All through that... I was thinking we never got to get past this. If I'd have known, I'd have said anything she wanted to hear."
7,10,RUFUS:,Bobby? Hey. Try the door. Now.
7,10,BOBBY:,"Thanks, Rufus."
7,10,BOBBY:,Balls.
7,10,RUFUS:,What year is this? '89-ish?
7,10,BOBBY:,What's it matter? I'm still stuck in eternal friggin' sunshine.
7,10,RUFUS:,"No, I was just thinking, man – you look pretty good there. Must've drank less."
7,10,YOUNG DEAN:,"Hey, Bobby, where are we going?"
7,10,YOUNGER BOBBY:,"Well, Dean, where's it look like?"
7,10,YOUNG DEAN:,Dad says I'm supposed to practice with the double-barrel.
7,10,YOUNGER BOBBY:,"Well, we're gonna skip the guns today. Here."
7,10,YOUNGER BOBBY:,"Here. Today... you're gonna throw a ball around, just like a regular snot-nosed little jerk."
7,10,RUFUS:,"You know, for a guy who'd rather break his wife's heart than give her a baby, you make a hell of a nanny."
7,10,BOBBY:,"Shut up, Rufus. We need another door."
7,10,BOBBY:,Let's go.
7,10,RUFUS:,"Seriously, though, Bobby, how come –"
7,10,BOBBY:,"Dog with a bone, Rufus."
7,10,RUFUS:,"No, I really want to know, man – why no kids?"
7,10,BOBBY:,"Ain't that deep. Dad was a mean drunk. I figured I'd be just like him. And, hey, look – I was right. No sense passing on the legacy."
7,10,RUFUS:,"Man, you're too hard on yourself. You're more of a cranky drunk. You do know that whatever you're trying to avoid with the eye rolls and the grump-a-lumping – that's exactly where you need to go."
7,10,BOBBY:,I ain't avoiding nothing.
7,10,RUFUS:,"Yeah, sure."
7,10,BOBBY:,"Get off my ass, Rufus."
7,10,RUFUS:,"Hey, Bobby, I'm trying to help you here, okay? You want to get out of here, or you want to die?"
7,10,BOBBY:,I'm trying. How am I supposed to know what I don't want me to know?
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,"Hey, look. The crown prince decided to drop by for a late bite."
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,"Oh, he – he was just washing up. So, w-who would like to say grace?"
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,Hell with grace. Pass me the biscuits.
7,10,YOUNG BOBBY:,I'm sorry.
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,What is the matter with you?
7,10,YOUNG BOBBY:,I don't know. I'm sorry.
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,You break everything you touch!
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,Let's just have a nice supper.
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,A nice supper?
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,Mm-hmm.
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,There's your nice supper.
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,I get no respect in this house.
7,10,RUFUS:,"What? Now, you can't tell me that wasn't gnarly enough to go spelunking in."
7,10,BOBBY:,That was any given Tuesday night. Believe me – it was nothing special.
7,10,RUFUS:,"No, no, no. You're scared."
7,10,BOBBY:,"No, I ain't. I just know we're in the wrong place, Rufus."
7,10,RUFUS:,"You – Okay, Bobby, you don't have time. That sound was not the weather, and you know it. We can't keep bopping through your greatest hits forever. That reaper's gonna catch up. I mean, if there was some way to stop the damn thing... But it's a reaper, Bobby. You're screwed."
7,10,BOBBY:,I know what we're gonna do.
7,10,RUFUS:,What?
7,10,BOBBY:,We're gonna stop the damn reaper.
7,10,SAM (V-O):,"So, there's nothing else we can do?"
7,10,DOCTOR:,I'm sorry. We just have to wait. We'll see if the swelling goes down.
7,10,DEAN:,How long?
7,10,DOCTOR:,It's hard to say in cases like this.
7,10,DEAN:,"Well, he's lasted this long. That's something, right?"
7,10,DOCTOR:,"Well, yes. Listen – the bullet didn't shatter. Only one hemisphere of his brain was injured. These are all positive things. But...I don't want to give you false hope here. He's far from out of the woods. Most of the time, cases like this..."
7,10,SAM:,They die.
7,10,DOCTOR:,Right now it comes down to him. I'll keep you updated.
7,10,MAN:,Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. Is one of you Robert Singer's next of kin?
7,10,MAN:,We know this is a stressful time.
7,10,DEAN:,"Yeah, okay. No offense – you can skip the garnish. What, did his insurance lapse, or what?"
7,10,MAN:,"We're sorry to ask, but, um, did your uncle ever make his wishes known i-in regards to organ donation? Organs are only viable for a very limited window –"
7,10,DEAN:,"""Viable""?"
7,10,MAN:,We're just hoping some good can come of this tragic –
7,10,DEAN:,Listen to me. I'm gonna say this once. He's not gonna die. It's one bullet. He's gonna be fine because he's always fine.
7,10,MAN:,I apologize.
7,10,DEAN:,"Why are you talking to me like he's gonna die, huh? I do my job! Do your jobs! Save him!"
7,10,MAN:,Of course they're doing everything they can.
7,10,DEAN:,Walk away from me. Now!
7,10,DEAN:,Dick! I know you're in there. Come on out...
7,10,DEAN:,...you dick.
7,10,DEAN:,"What, did you come here to finish the job?"
7,10,DEAN:,"Yeah? Well, come on. Right here, right now, out in the open, you and me, Dick Roman."
7,10,DEAN:,See? Deciding to jump a famous guy ain't all upside. You can kill me right now – you want to see it online.
7,10,DICK ROMAN:,Maybe you should go check on that friend of yours. He can't be feeling too frisky right about now. I'm a very good shot.
7,10,DEAN:,"We're coming for you, and not just to hurt you – to kill you. You understand me?"
7,10,DICK ROMAN:,"Come on, Dean. I can't be killed."
7,10,DEAN:,"You're gonna wish you could, then."
7,10,DICK ROMAN:,[laughs] That's some conviction. You'd really crush it on the motivational circuit.
7,10,DEAN:,"You're either laughing because you're scared or you're laughing because you're stupid. I'll see you soon, Dick."
7,10,BOBBY:,It's in an old King James Bible.
7,10,RUFUS:,"So, what exactly are we doing now, Bobby?"
7,10,BOBBY:,"Well, technically, you're correct. You can't stop a reaper, not permanently. Only their boss can do that, and we don't want him involved."
7,10,BOBBY:,Ah. Now we're cooking with gas.
7,10,RUFUS:,What is that?
7,10,BOBBY:,"Well, Sam and Dean have run up against these suckers a couple, three times. Picked up a few tricks – enough to slow them down a hair, at least."
7,10,RUFUS:,All right. Let's work some mojo.
7,10,SAM:,What did that guy want?
7,10,DEAN:,"Uh, nothing. Just some insurance mook. Dick Roman was out there."
7,10,SAM:,What? What happened?
7,10,DEAN:,Nothing...For now. It was just a friggin' staring contest. That was about it. What's the update?
7,10,SAM:,"The swelling's down a little. They took him off sedation. Apparently, he – he started fighting his tube. So they pulled them out, and he's breathing on his own."
7,10,DEAN:,"That's good, right? Is that good?"
7,10,SAM:,"Yeah. Well, doctor said best-case scenario."
7,10,DEAN:,"All right, so when they gonna take the bullet out?"
7,10,SAM:,"Dean, t-they're not even – they're not even gonna try that, not yet."
7,10,DEAN:,What does that mean?
7,10,SAM:,"The word's ""abrading,"" I think."
7,10,DEAN:,English.
7,10,SAM:,Cutting out the dead brain tissue.
7,10,MAN:,"I don’t know, Alex. I-I don’t know."
7,10,SAM:,That's if the doctor even thinks it's worth the risk.
7,10,WOMAN:,"You know, I, uh... You’re working..."
7,10,MAN:,I don’t know.
7,10,WOMAN:,I’m – I’m...
7,10,SAM:,Can I talk to you?
7,10,DEAN:,What? Talk about what?
7,10,SAM:,You know what.
7,10,DEAN:,"No, we're not gonna have that conversation."
7,10,SAM:,"Well, we need to."
7,10,DEAN:,He's not gonna die.
7,10,SAM:,He might.
7,10,DEAN:,Sam.
7,10,SAM:,"Dean, listen – we need to brace ourselves."
7,10,DEAN:,Why?
7,10,SAM:,Because it's real.
7,10,DEAN:,What do you want to do? You want to hug and – and say we made it through it when Dad died? We've been through enough.
7,10,BOBBY:,"We still need gold ore, hemlock, and mace."
7,10,RUFUS:,"Mm. So, pretty basic, then, huh?"
7,10,BOBBY:,What the hell?
7,10,REAPER:,Cute. Got to admit – first time anyone's pulled one on me while actually unconscious.
7,10,BOBBY:,"Well, get comfy."
7,10,REAPER:,Not so fast.
7,10,BOBBY:,Yeah? Sorry. Other business.
7,10,REAPER:,"I'm trying to help you, Bobby. You're going to die. Think you can stop it by pinning me like a bug?"
7,10,BOBBY:,Well –
7,10,REAPER:,"You've seen the dark coming – people disappearing, things going blank. Look around. Cell by cell..."
7,10,REAPER:,"...that bullet's killing your brain. You're running out of places to hide. So, understand – this trap won't hold forever, because this room won't hold, because you are going to die."
7,10,BOBBY:,You think.
7,10,REAPER:,Come with me. Be done. You've earned it. Or fight me. Stay here. And you know the drill.
7,10,RUFUS:,"I don't know, Bobby. I mean, you really want to get stuck, turn into some ghost?"
7,10,BOBBY:,"I know what I'm doing, Rufus."
7,10,RUFUS:,"Yeah, yeah, you're thinking you can help those boys. But how many spirits you meet in their right mind? Some hunter's gonna cut you down."
7,10,BOBBY:,Whose side are you on?
7,10,REAPER:,"Bobby... You've helped. You got handed a small, unremarkable life, and you did something with it. Most men like you die of liver disease, watching ""Barney Miller"" reruns. You've done enough. Believe me."
7,10,BOBBY:,I don't care.
7,10,REAPER:,Why?
7,10,BOBBY:,Because they're my boys.
7,10,BOBBY:,All right. The only way out is through.
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,It's fine. It'll just take a second.
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,You just gonna sit there? Get a broom or somethin'.
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,You know why he's like that? Because you let him do whatever he wants.
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,It's okay. See? I'm almost done. You just relax a-and have another drink.
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,Don't tell me what to do.
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,No. Wait. Wait.
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,I– no! Why do you always provoke him?
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,Because he's a bad kid – that's why.
7,10,BOBBY:,"Well, that's a load of crap. Who the hell were you to say?"
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,I'm your father. And you show your father respect.
7,10,BOBBY:,"The day he deserves it, you drunken..."
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,[quietly] Shhh...
7,10,BOBBY:,... bully. Punching women and kids – is that what they call fatherhood in your day?
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,"Oh, you deserved it. Believe me. You were nothing but ungrateful."
7,10,BOBBY:,"I was a kid! Kids ain't supposed to be grateful! They're supposed to eat your food and break your heart, you selfish dick! You died, and I was still so afraid I'd turn into you I never even had kids of my own."
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,Good. You break everything you touch.
7,10,BOBBY:,"Uh-huh. Well, as fate would have it, I adopted two boys, and they grew up great. They grew up heroes. So you can go to hell!"
7,10,NURSE:,Keep the head of the bed up for transport. IV can run off the pump. Just run a TKVO. We'll have to wait for respiratory.
7,10,SAM:,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's happening?"
7,10,NURSE:,"He's showing signs of responsiveness. We're taking him up for surgery. If you want to see him, I'd squeeze in there quick."
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,I'm sorry. I said that I'm – I'm sorry.
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,"Yeah, yeah, you say that every time."
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,Please just stop.
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,"[shouting] No! This time, you listen!"
7,10,YOUNG BOBBY:,Stop it.
7,10,BOBBY’S FATHER:,"You're kidding, right? You're not half enough man to use that thing. You leave the adults to sort this out... and I will deal with you later."
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,"Ohh! Aah! Bobby, just go. Do what he says. Just go."
7,10,YOUNG BOBBY:,No.
7,10,YOUNG BOBBY:,Leave her alone.
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,Aah!
7,10,BOBBY’S MOTHER:,"Bobby, what did you do? God is gonna punish you."
7,10,BOBBY:,Hey.
7,10,BOBBY:,You did what you had to do. This is where you learn that... they pretty much never say thanks when you save 'em. Now go get a shovel. Bury the old man out behind the woodshed.
7,10,REAPER:,You got the only genetic case of bullet in the brain I've ever seen.
7,10,REAPER:,"Not so fast, Singer."
7,10,NURSE:,Sorry. We need to get moving.
7,10,SAM:,Right. Yeah.
7,10,SAM:,"Hey, um... Bobby, um, hey..."
7,10,SAM:,Just... thanks... for everything.
7,10,NURSE:,All right. Please step back.
7,10,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,10,SAM:,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop. His eyes are open."
7,10,DEAN:,Bobby?
7,10,SAM:,Hey.
7,10,DEAN:,What – don't talk. Don't talk. A pen – I –
7,10,DEAN:,"Here. Here, here, here."
7,10,DEAN:,What is it?
7,10,BOBBY:,Idjits.
7,10,DEAN:,Bobby? Hey!
7,10,NURSE:,Call a code – trauma room.
7,10,DEAN:,"You microbrewing in there, or what? Come on – we got a lot of Chuck Norris to get through. Let's go."
7,10,REAPER:,"Nice move, waking up like that."
7,10,BOBBY:,Motivation's a mother.
7,10,REAPER:,"You know why it's dark out there, don't you? This house – it's your last island, everything else melted by that bullet – gone. This is your last chance to come with me and move on. For your own good, Bobby, let go. They'll be okay without you."
7,10,BOBBY:,"Last memory, huh?"
7,10,BOBBY:,Glad I saved the best for last.
7,10,DEAN:,"All right, scoot, jerkface. Show your elders some respect."
7,10,SAM:,"You scoot, ass-hat."
7,10,SAM:,Mm.
7,10,DEAN:,Did we get licorice?
7,10,DEAN:,"I'm sorry. I didn't quite understand that, uh, Mr. Peanut-Butter-and-Banana Sandwiches?"
7,10,SAM:,You know what? I stand by that sandwich. Nobody likes licorice. I-it's – it's made of dirt.
7,10,DEAN:,It is a classic movie food. It's right up there with popcorn.
7,10,SAM:,Popcorn? Really?
7,10,DEAN:,Yes.
7,10,SAM:,You're out of your mind.
7,10,DEAN:,What – it's like little chewy...
7,10,DEAN (V-O):,... pieces of heaven.
7,10,SAM (V-O):,"Oh, chewy pieces of heaven if you're a girl."
7,10,REAPER:,"Well, Bobby? Stay or go – what's it gonna be?"
7,11,MAN:,Thank you.
7,11,MARLENE:,Sure. You've been here a couple nights in a row now.
7,11,MAN:,What can I say? I like the ambience.
7,11,MARLENE:,Get you anything else?
7,11,MAN:,"No, thanks."
7,11,MARLENE:,Thanks. Keep safe out there.
7,11,MARLENE:,"Hey, there. You lost?"
7,11,MAN:,What?
7,11,MAN:,Excuse me...
7,11,MARLENE:,"Ooh-hoo. You're looking a little Cabo Wabo, there."
7,11,MAN:,"No. No, I'm fine."
7,11,MARLENE:,"No. You're not. I slipped a little special sauce into your coffee while you were watching the skirt. You do know we're venomous, right?"
7,11,MARLENE:,Looks like I didn't dose you quite hard enough. That's okay. There's more where that came from.
7,11,MARLENE:,That's for the crappy tip.
7,11,SAM:,"Dean, you know, um... I wonder if – if we... I mean, should we be telling people? I mean, people he knew."
7,11,DEAN:,"How long ago did I give Frank these numbers? It's been a few weeks, right? What, is he nuts, or is he just being rude?"
7,11,SAM:,"Probably both. Dean, I-I got to ask you a question."
7,11,DEAN:,"Unless, of course, something happened to him. He can't get to the phone because a Leviathan ate his face."
7,11,SAM:,"Yeah, also a possibility."
7,11,DEAN:,We should go check on him.
7,11,SAM:,"Dean, do you want to call Bobby's people or not?"
7,11,DEAN:,W-why is – why is that our job?
7,11,SAM:,Because who else is gonna do it?
7,11,DEAN:,"I'm not calling anybody. If you want to, you go right ahead."
7,11,SAM:,I don't want to call anybody. You kidding me?
7,11,DEAN:,"Well, I'm not getting it."
7,11,SAM:,Hello?
7,11,GIRL (V-O):,Is Bobby Singer there?
7,11,SAM:,"Uh, no. He's, uh... I-I-it's not, but I'm a friend of his."
7,11,GIRL (V-O):,My dad asked me to call Bobby Singer specifically.
7,11,SAM:,"He's... not here, but, look, if you need s–"
7,11,DEAN:,Who was it?
7,11,SAM:,Just some kid.
7,11,DEAN:,For Bobby? Girl scout cookies?
7,11,SAM:,I think maybe...
7,11,SAM:,"Maybe a-a hunter's kid? I mean, she sounded pretty scared. You know, I have a caller ID. Maybe we should go find her. We – we can check on her."
7,11,DEAN:,What about Frank?
7,11,SAM:,"Well, Dean, I think we should go find this girl first."
7,11,DEAN:,"Sam, Frank's been working on the numbers that Bobby spent his last breath on, and you want to back-burner that?"
7,11,DEAN:,Fine. You go check out girl scout. I'll find Frank.
7,11,SAM:,"Fine. But you know what? On one condition – if Frank is just spinning his wheels, then you bail out on crazy and come meet me."
7,11,DEAN:,And thanks for drinking my entire beer.
7,11,SAM:,I didn't touch your beer. Mine's right there. You probably drank it without noticing.
7,11,DEAN:,Right.
7,11,SAM:,"Hello? Um, we...spoke on the phone earlier?"
7,11,SAM:,"Hi. Uh...I'm Sam. You sounded like you needed help, and I was in the area."
7,11,GIRL:,How'd you find me?
7,11,SAM:,Your dad is in Bobby's address book.
7,11,GIRL:,So where is he?
7,11,SAM:,"Bobby? He, uh... He's passed away. Look, um –"
7,11,GIRL:,Krissy.
7,11,SAM:,"Krissy. I get it. You don't let strangers in. But if your dad said you could trust Bobby, then you can trust me, too."
7,11,KRISSY:,"Just so you know, 911's on speed-dial. One button."
7,11,SAM:,"Yeah, sure. Note taken."
7,11,KRISSY:,"So... you're a salesman, too?"
7,11,SAM:,Yep. So your dad's on the road right now? Been gone a while?
7,11,KRISSY:,He usually calls every night.
7,11,SAM:,How long has it been?
7,11,KRISSY:,Five days.
7,11,SAM:,"It's just you and him, huh? I know how that is. Look, um... Sometimes on the road, crap happens. So I'll help you track him down."
7,11,KRISSY:,Really?
7,11,SAM:,'Course. Did he happen to say where he was going?
7,11,KRISSY:,Said he had a couple leads near Dodge City.
7,11,SAM:,And does he have a desk or something where he keeps his stuff?
7,11,SAM:,Do you mind making some coffee? Thanks.
7,11,SAM:,Krissy.
7,11,SAM:,"Hey, listen, so I think I got an idea where to start. So I'm gonna go. Um...Can I borrow this?"
7,11,KRISSY:,Yeah.
7,11,SAM:,"Thanks. Here. Here's a number, in case you don't hear from me in the next couple days. Don't worry. I promise I'll check in."
7,11,KRISSY:,Don't say that. That's what my dad said.
7,11,DEAN:,This can't be good.
7,11,DEAN:,Well... hi.
7,11,DEAN:,"Frank... we're amongst friends here. Okay, acquaintances."
7,11,FRANK:,That's just what a Leviathan would say.
7,11,DEAN:,Frank. I'm not a Leviathan.
7,11,FRANK:,"Oh, sure. You're not a Leviathan. Dick Roman's not a Leviathan. Gwyneth Paltrow is not a Leviathan."
7,11,DEAN:,Yeah?
7,11,FRANK:,Trust me.
7,11,FRANK:,"They're anywhere, anyone. Who's to say this ain't the day they come for old Frank who knew too much?"
7,11,DEAN:,"They bleed black goo, right? You want to see what I bleed?"
7,11,DEAN:,"Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's take the guns out of it, okay?"
7,11,FRANK:,Okay.
7,11,DEAN:,See? Red-blooded American.
7,11,DEAN:,Now...
7,11,DEAN:,Your turn.
7,11,FRANK:,"Oh! Whoa. Look, I'm obviously not –"
7,11,DEAN:,"Fair's fair, douchebag."
7,11,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,11,DEAN:,I'm glad we could share that together.
7,11,FRANK:,"Grab your gun, come with me. For God's sake, don't make any noise."
7,11,DEAN:,Why the downsize?
7,11,FRANK:,"You! ""Hey, Frank, go dig up some dirt on Richard Roman."" That night, I was burned off every IP I had. Ears on my phones, eyes on my house..."
7,11,DEAN:,Wait – Dick's got people watching you?
7,11,FRANK:,"Do I look like I know? You think it's easy to see this deep into what's real and also be bipolar with delusional ideation? There is no pill for my situation, sweetiepop, so, yeah, best guess – the bigmouths are onto me. Next question."
7,11,DEAN:,"All right. Well, what's the word on the bigmouths?"
7,11,FRANK:,"Their tentacles are everywhere. I-I'm looking at bankers, military high-ups..."
7,11,DEAN:,This is why you didn't call me back.
7,11,FRANK:,"Hey, cut me some slack. You called me like four days ago."
7,11,FRANK:,"What? No. Really? Days, weeks – quit busting my chops."
7,11,DEAN:,"What, are you kidding me?"
7,11,FRANK:,"You cool your heels, Buster Brown."
7,11,DEAN:,"Frank, I paid you fifteen grand for this."
7,11,FRANK:,"Yeah, I get that –"
7,11,FRANK:,"Look, I'm sorry about Bobby. I really am. You know, this one time, we were in Fresno, and we got stuck –"
7,11,DEAN:,"No. No, no, no. I'm not gonna play ""this one time with Bobby"" crap, all right? I'm not gonna get all warm and fuzzy with somebody else who barely knew him."
7,11,FRANK:,Just trying to make friendly conversation.
7,11,DEAN:,"This is not a friendship, Frank. I'm paying you!"
7,11,FRANK:,"Hey. You know what you need? A little LSD, a little shiatsu –"
7,11,DEAN:,I'm out of here.
7,11,FRANK:,"Hey, you want to know what those numbers are? Bupkis. They're not lottery numbers, license –"
7,11,DEAN:,"I know that, Frank. Thank you."
7,11,FRANK:,Which leaves us little else to do but probability generate.
7,11,DEAN:,Come again?
7,11,FRANK:,"You run most reasonable possibilities for a Levi-related five-digit number written by a dying drunk, you come up flat. Know what you start to wonder? ""Hey, maybe I'm missing a number."""
7,11,DEAN:,"Well, how do you figure?"
7,11,FRANK:,"Oh, I don't know. Because Bobby was dying of brain trauma. I just had a tickle there was a reason nothing was popping out at us, so I set up a program to run possibilities for six numbers, seven, eight. But good news."
7,11,DEAN:,Good news?
7,11,FRANK:,"Never had to go past six, because this..."
7,11,FRANK:,"...my little lamb, is coordinates."
7,11,DEAN:,You sure? To what?
7,11,FRANK:,A field in Wisconsin.
7,11,DEAN:,"No. No, Bobby didn't give us coordinates to some patch of weeds in Cheeseville."
7,11,FRANK:,"No, he gave you coordinates to a parcel recently purchased by Willman, Inc., a subsidiary of [FRANK makes a trumpeting noise] Richard Roman Enterprises."
7,11,DEAN:,So what do we do?
7,11,FRANK:,"Stay away. Or, if we're stupid... we go there and set up surveillance."
7,11,MORGUE ATTENDANT:,Matthew Havlena – found in a ditch off the interstate.
7,11,SAM:,Cause of death?
7,11,MORGUE ATTENDANT:,Missing five pints of blood can't have helped. Puncture wounds – femoral arteries and carotid.
7,11,SAM:,"So, what? Some kind of animal attack?"
7,11,MORGUE ATTENDANT:,Or a vampire.
7,11,MORGUE ATTENDANT:,Huh. That... usually gets at least a chuckle.
7,11,FRANK:,Got the equipment arranged. Come and get your costume on. We can scoot.
7,11,DEAN:,"""Costume""? What?"
7,11,DEAN:,What the hell's so special about this place?
7,11,FRANK:,I love a mystery. Now get up in that cherry picker and act like you're fixing something.
7,11,DEAN:,I don't know how to drive that thing.
7,11,FRANK:,You think I do?
7,11,DEAN:,"Well, why do I got to be the sap that –"
7,11,FRANK:,"This one says ""manager."" That one says ""technician."" Sometime this month?"
7,11,DEAN:,Come on. Yah! Whoo!
7,11,DEAN:,Okay... aaah! Up. Moving. Aah.
7,11,FRANK:,"Oh, crap. Come on down, Tarzan!"
7,11,DEAN:,What?
7,11,FRANK:,Get down here. We need to move. They got this place wired up the wazoo.
7,11,DEAN:,They're watching us right now?
7,11,FRANK:,"Nah, nah, they're just watching Cheech and Ed from Ma Bell."
7,11,FRANK:,Right. So we need to tap into theirs instead.
7,11,DEAN:,"All right, now what?"
7,11,FRANK:,You look horrific. When was the last time you really slept a night?
7,11,DEAN:,"Let's just work, all right?"
7,11,FRANK:,This is it. We watch the screens. I can take the first shift. You're no use if you can't even...
7,11,FRANK:,Keep your eyes open.
7,11,SAM:,Excuse me. Your manager said that you might be able to help me.
7,11,MARLENE:,Sure. What can I do for you?
7,11,SAM:,You ever see this man?
7,11,MARLENE:,I...might have served him the other day. I think he may have gone to talk to that girl out there.
7,11,SAM:,Thanks.
7,11,SAM:,"Hey! Can I talk to you for a second, uh..."
7,11,SAM:,Sally? You ever see this man?
7,11,SALLY:,No.
7,11,SAM:,You sure?
7,11,SALLY:,It's not safe here. Somewhere private.
7,11,SALLY:,Something's happening around here. I'm afraid I'll be next.
7,11,SAM:,Tell me what you saw.
7,11,SALLY:,I don't know what I saw.
7,11,SAM:,"Sally, run!"
7,11,DEAN:,How long was I out?
7,11,FRANK:,'Bout 36 hours.
7,11,DEAN:,What? Why didn't you wake me?
7,11,FRANK:,Not your butler. Come see this.
7,11,DEAN:,What?
7,11,FRANK:,This is where it gets good.
7,11,DEAN:,"Frank, you need to get out more."
7,11,FRANK:,Not that.
7,11,FRANK:,Check out Sarah Palin.
7,11,DEAN:,Who is she?
7,11,FRANK:,Amanda Willer.
7,11,FRANK:,"Surprise, surprise – works for Richard Roman."
7,11,DEAN:,What was she doing?
7,11,FRANK:,"Being a naughty, bossy little girl."
7,11,DEAN:,"Well, I hate to ask for that in the non-porno version."
7,11,FRANK:,They're surveying. They're getting ready to build something.
7,11,DEAN:,Build what?
7,11,FRANK:,Exactly. What? No idea.
7,11,DEAN:,"Well, how do we find out?"
7,11,FRANK:,"We watch. Patience, grasshopper."
7,11,DEAN:,"Yeah, patience and me aren't exactly on terms."
7,11,FRANK:,"Well, then go out and kill something or whatever you kids do to blow off steam. What, you don't like my suggestion?"
7,11,DEAN:,"I don't think you're in a position to be giving suggestions, all right? I think you're one tinfoil hat away from a rubber room."
7,11,FRANK:,Did I mention you look awful?
7,11,DEAN:,Yes. Maybe because somebody I cared about just got shot in the head. And this is like shoving a rock up a hill. And – screw you.
7,11,FRANK:,Here's my advice you didn't ask for – quit.
7,11,DEAN:,What?!
7,11,FRANK:,You want to keep going?
7,11,DEAN:,I want Dick Roman on a spit.
7,11,FRANK:,But you're gonna drive yourself into the ground first. Good plan.
7,11,DEAN:,[after a pause] I'm not gonna quit. It's not even an option. I'm not gonna walk out on my brother.
7,11,FRANK:,"Okay, then, fine. Do what I did."
7,11,DEAN:,What? Go native? Stock up on C-rations?
7,11,FRANK:,"No, cupcake. What I did when I was 26 and came home to find my wife and two kids gutted on the floor. Decide to be fine till the end of the week. Make yourself smile because you're alive and that's your job. Then do it again the next week."
7,11,DEAN:,So fake it?
7,11,FRANK:,"I call it being professional. Do it right, with a smile, or don't do it."
7,11,FRANK:,What's the guff?
7,11,DEAN:,He –
7,11,KRISSY’S FATHER:,That ringing in your ears – it's from the venom.
7,11,SAM:,Venom?
7,11,KRISSY’S FATHER:,Yeah. They hit you with some kind of knockout juice. You seem to be handling this pretty well.
7,11,SAM:,"Yeah. Well, um... I was out there looking for you. Lee Chambers?"
7,11,SAM:,I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's. Krissy called. She – she's fine. She is. She's just worried about you. So how do we get out of here?
7,11,LEE:,I don’t know. They'll be back pretty quick here.
7,11,SAM:,Just the two of them?
7,11,LEE:,"Yeah, they're a tag team. One of them knocks you out. The other one dumps your rig or your ride or whatever miles down the road. It's a pretty nice system they got."
7,11,SAM:,They've been draining you.
7,11,LEE:,"Yeah. They tap you three, four times, you're dead. And let me tell you... you can't see... you can't walk. I thought they'd kill me right off, but they don't have to. They got nothing to worry about."
7,11,SAM:,How many times they fed on you?
7,11,LEE:,Three.
7,11,KRISSY:,Did Sam tell you where he was going?
7,11,DEAN:,That's what I'm trying to figure out. What did you tell him?
7,11,KRISSY:,Uh...He checked my dad's room.
7,11,DEAN:,There?
7,11,KRISSY:,Yeah.
7,11,DEAN:,"Look, I really don't have time to hold your hand here, so –"
7,11,KRISSY:,What are you saying?
7,11,DEAN:,I'm saying go wait in the living room. Your dad may not want you to know every single thing about him.
7,11,DEAN:,Where is it?
7,11,KRISSY:,You mean everything about the job my dad was working?
7,11,DEAN:,Sam said you didn't know.
7,11,DEAN:,"All right, I get it. You're a tough kid. But I'm trying to get Sam and your dad back."
7,11,DEAN:,I'm coming back.
7,11,KRISSY:,I'm coming with you.
7,11,DEAN:,"N-no. No. Hell, no."
7,11,KRISSY:,I'm coming! Or you're not going.
7,11,KRISSY:,Ow!
7,11,DEAN:,Now hand it over.
7,11,KRISSY:,I can't. I burned it.
7,11,DEAN:,You what?
7,11,KRISSY:,"But lucky for you, I memorized it all first."
7,11,KRISSY:,"Hey, I have a question."
7,11,DEAN:,"All right, here's the deal. I'm a fun guy. I'm actually awesome. Okay? But right now, I'm not in the mood. I'm neck deep in some serious crap, and if this wasn't an emergency, I would drop your ass off at the nearest mall."
7,11,KRISSY:,What serious crap?
7,11,DEAN:,"Revenge crap, all right? Now shut up. Eat a cookie or something."
7,11,KRISSY:,"One thing doesn't make sense, though. My dad's a pretty great hunter, and your brother's the size of a car, so... So how'd this thing get 'em both?"
7,11,DEAN:,Vetalas usually hunt in pairs. Sam and your dad both assumed it was one thing hunting solo.
7,11,KRISSY:,Why'd they think that?
7,11,DEAN:,"Because they had the wrong info. Or, best available. Our dad took down a loner years ago. Sam has his journal. Your dad must've been going on the same facts."
7,11,KRISSY:,And you know different 'cause...?
7,11,DEAN:,"Sam was away at Stanford, smartass."
7,11,KRISSY:,Sam went to college? I thought you said your dad was a hunter.
7,11,DEAN:,"You could, too, you know – go to college. Be a hunter/pediatrician."
7,11,SALLY:,Hunter day at the all-you-can-eat. How's everyone feeling? Good?
7,11,SALLY:,Strong silent. Fine. I don't need much entertainment with my meal.
7,11,SAM:,"Hey, Sally, uh, did I tell you about the Vetalas I took down in Utah? Yeah. You remind me of them. Except they were so much...younger."
7,11,SAM:,I tied 'em up. Not because I had to. More so... I could take my time.
7,11,SALLY:,You're lying.
7,11,SAM:,No. I just want you to know how much I enjoyed cutting up your sisters.
7,11,SALLY:,Shut up!
7,11,SAM:,Aah!
7,11,DEAN:,You ever actually work with your dad?
7,11,KRISSY:,Sure. 'Course.
7,11,DEAN:,"No, I mean work, not shoot cans in the woods."
7,11,KRISSY:,"I mean, I help all the time."
7,11,DEAN:,"So, no. Well, right about now, your stomach should be pretty knotted up."
7,11,KRISSY:,"Not really. Look, maybe this was a lot harder for you when you were my age."
7,11,DEAN:,"Oh, you think you're a good actress. You're not."
7,11,KRISSY:,What are you talking about?
7,11,DEAN:,"Well, I hate to break it to you, but it's all over your face – you're scared."
7,11,KRISSY:,Quit treating me like I'm some girl. I've been prepping for this my entire life.
7,11,DEAN:,Training's one thing. Doing – whole ’nother beast.
7,11,KRISSY:,"Wow. You really scared me straight. Thanks, Dean."
7,11,KRISSY:,Why is that waitress getting into that truck?
7,11,DEAN:,I'm not explaining the R-rated crap to you.
7,11,DEAN:,All right.
7,11,KRISSY:,What century is this? No one fist-bumps anymore.
7,11,DEAN:,Come on. Give it up. Good work.
7,11,KRISSY:,You're a dweeb.
7,11,KRISSY:,What the hell?
7,11,DEAN:,I got an idea.
7,11,DEAN:,How 'bout you stay here?
7,11,KRISSY:,"Oh, you jackass."
7,11,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, I'm the jackass who ain't bringing a kid in there, period."
7,11,KRISSY:,Why? I can do everything you can do.
7,11,DEAN:,I'll bring them back. Trust me.
7,11,KRISSY:,"Please, they're probably dead."
7,11,DEAN:,You don't know that.
7,11,KRISSY:,"It's been days. Probably just a pile of meat. I've seen it. People die, Dean. I watched my mom get torn to shreds. Let me go in there and kill them."
7,11,DEAN:,No. Sorry.
7,11,KRISSY:,You're such a hypocrite. How come you get to do it and I don't?
7,11,DEAN:,Because I'm the grown-up!
7,11,DEAN:,Give it to me.
7,11,KRISSY:,What?
7,11,DEAN:,Thank you.
7,11,MARLENE:,Good thing we picked up a new one. This one's about tapped out. You want to finish him together?
7,11,SALLY:,Sure. Love to.
7,11,MARLENE:,Not so fast.
7,11,KRISSY:,"Dad, hold on – I got you!"
7,11,LEE:,No!
7,11,SALLY:,Let her go... or Little Miss Sunshine here gets it.
7,11,LEE:,"What were you thinking, bringing her here?"
7,11,SALLY:,Now drop the knife!
7,11,DEAN:,She's just a child. Let her go.
7,11,SALLY:,"Yeah, I don't think we'll be letting anyone go."
7,11,KRISSY:,Daddy...
7,11,LEE:,"It's okay, baby. Everything's gonna be fine."
7,11,MARLENE:,All right. Enough with the family bonding. It's time for you to shut up.
7,11,KRISSY:,"Daddy, no! Dean!"
7,11,SALLY:,He can't help you. No one can.
7,11,KRISSY:,"I guess I'll have to help myself, then."
7,11,KRISSY:,"Bad actress, huh?"
7,11,DEAN:,"Yeah, I take it back."
7,11,LEE:,"Yeah, I was hoping you'd stop by. I wanted to thank you."
7,11,SAM:,It's no problem.
7,11,LEE:,"No, you saved my life. Krissy's, too."
7,11,SAM:,"Actually, uh, she kind of saved ours."
7,11,DEAN:,"Don't thank us. Quit. Your daughter's 14 years old. She's already a hunter with a-a kill under her belt. I'm not trying to be a dick, but what do you think that does to her life span? She could still be a regular kid."
7,11,LEE:,"You know, I got into this for a reason."
7,11,DEAN:,I know. Your family. That's the same reason you should get out now.
7,11,LEE:,I can't. You ever know anyone who left the life?
7,11,DEAN:,No. They all get killed first.
7,11,SAM:,"Well, uh... we should probably let you get some rest."
7,11,LEE:,Yeah.
7,11,KRISSY:,"Dean! Thanks for saying bye, asshat."
7,11,DEAN:,"Oh, what? Now you're sentimental?"
7,11,KRISSY:,No. Just wanted to tell you that you're kind of amusing for an old man.
7,11,DEAN:,"How'd you get out of them cuffs, anyway?"
7,11,KRISSY:,Girl's got to have her secrets.
7,11,DEAN:,"Bobby pin. You know, you could've gotten yourself killed."
7,11,KRISSY:,I saved your bacon.
7,11,DEAN:,My point stands. But yes.
7,11,KRISSY:,So... Guess I'm retiring – one and done.
7,11,DEAN:,Really? How you feel about that?
7,11,KRISSY:,Who knows? Maybe I'll go to Stanford like Sam.
7,11,KRISSY:,We're so lame.
7,11,DEAN:,"Yeah, we are. Take care of yourself."
7,11,SAM:,You know what? Good for them.
7,11,DEAN:,Yeah. It's nice to walk away from someone and feel like they could be okay. How about you? How you doing? You all right?
7,11,SAM:,"No. I'm definitely not. But, you know, I mean, um, I think, maybe... I just want to work."
7,11,SAM:,Should I even ask?
7,11,DEAN:,I'm fine.
7,11,SAM:,"""Fine,"" meaning...?"
7,11,DEAN:,"You're right. We should just... work, right? And figure out a way to kick Dick Roman's ass. Well, hey, we are the professionals."
7,11,DEAN,All right--
7,11,DEAN,"Yeah, that'd be nice, wouldn't it?"
7,12,DEAN:,"All right, let's do this. Move fast."
7,12,SAM:,"Wait, wait, wait. What's the plan exactly?"
7,12,DEAN:,Don't die.
7,12,DEAN:,"He's heading downtown. All right, you take the street. I'll take the alley. I'll meet you in the middle."
7,12,DEAN:,Son of a...
7,12,SAM:,Dean?
7,12,SAM:,Dean?!
7,12,DEAN:,Don't give me that dirty-diaper look. I ain't calling you.
7,12,SAM:,That was Sheriff Mills. She caught us one.
7,12,DEAN:,"Oh, I feel bad. We didn't get her anything."
7,12,SAM:,"I can't believe I'm about to say this but I hope you're watching cartoon smut, 'cause reading Dick Roman crap over and over again is just self-punishment."
7,12,DEAN:,"It's called anime, and it's an art form."
7,12,DEAN:,"Well, this looks nice. Check around back?"
7,12,SAM:,"Well, there’s a... semi-functioning bathroom and one un-rancid bedroom."
7,12,DEAN:,"Define semi-functioning, and do not use the words ""hole in the floor."""
7,12,DEAN:,How does paper beat a rock? It's stupid.
7,12,SAM:,Kids playing hide-and-seek found the body.
7,12,DEAN:,Wow. Very King Tut.
7,12,SAM:,"Yeah, so, uh, this is where the eyewitness to the assault lives, but the cops are calling him an unreliable witness."
7,12,DEAN:,Because?
7,12,SAM:,Let's find out.
7,12,DEAN:,"Special Agent Smith. This is, uh, Special Agent Smith. No relation."
7,12,MAN:,"Whoa. Do you mind if we, uh... My mom's sleeping in there."
7,12,MAN:,"S-so, how can I...?"
7,12,SAM:,"Oh, we, uh – we had a few questions about the incident you witnessed in the alley."
7,12,MAN:,You just gonna laugh at my story like the rest of the suits?
7,12,DEAN:,We're not gonna laugh at you.
7,12,MAN:,"All right, well, I'm on the steps... medicating... when I hear fighting. So I look. There's my neighbor Durbin, and some dude dressed like my grandpa's got him by the neck, right?"
7,12,DEAN:,What do you mean he looks like your grandpa?
7,12,MAN:,"Uh... Snappy shoes, suit, one of those, um, Justin Timberlake hats."
7,12,SAM:,Y-you mean a – a fedora?
7,12,MAN:,Aha!
7,12,SAM:,Did you see anything else?
7,12,MAN:,"This red, like, energy passed through Durbin to hat guy. Even my watch stopped. Durbs... he aged before my eyes. He looked like a raisin."
7,12,SAM:,"Well, we believe you."
7,12,MAN:,Oh!
7,12,DEAN:,Thanks for your help.
7,12,MAN:,"Thank you, officer – officers."
7,12,DEAN:,Wow.
7,12,DEAN:,Yep. Nothing that turns a dude into a Cryptkeeper. You?
7,12,SAM:,"Uh, well, greater Canton turns out kind of a hot spot for weird dead bodies."
7,12,DEAN:,Hmm. You don't say.
7,12,SAM:,Yeah. News archives.
7,12,SAM:,"They're not exactly reporting, uh, mummifies. But still, uh – 1928..."
7,12,SAM:,"...three deaths cited as spontaneous combustion. Bodies, quote, ""shriveled despite no signs of fire."""
7,12,DEAN:,"Little stretch, but okay."
7,12,SAM:,'74...
7,12,SAM:,"...three bodies found with leathery decay. Uh, '57..."
7,12,SAM:,...three more –
7,12,SAM:,Severe dehydration. This time one made the front page.
7,12,SAM:,Girl named Terry Cervantes found a corpse near her church.
7,12,DEAN:,Any pattern here other than the location?
7,12,SAM:,"Random vics, random years. But they seem to drop in threes."
7,12,DEAN:,"That's two down, one to go. All right, let me drive for a sec."
7,12,SAM:,"What, are you gonna look up more anime, or are you strictly into Dick now?"
7,12,DEAN:,Hmm.
7,12,SAM:,Are those local feeds?
7,12,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,12,SAM:,How did you do that so fast?
7,12,DEAN:,"A little tutorial from Frank. Don't worry. We'll pretend this never happened. Now, mummy numero dos was, uh,  found at the Gas n' Sip near Main Street, correct?"
7,12,SAM:,Yeah.
7,12,DEAN:,"All right, well, here's all the cameras around that store."
7,12,SAM:,You need to teach me that trick.
7,12,DEAN:,"Hey, check it out – Timberlake."
7,12,SAM:,Wait a sec.
7,12,DEAN:,"You can't let me bask in the glory for one second, can you?"
7,12,SAM:,Shut up. Look.
7,12,DEAN:,"He hasn't aged a day, has he? All right, well, if he's been popping up for decades now, then somebody's bound to know who he is, right? Is there any chance that, uh, Terry's still local?"
7,12,TERRY:,"You know it's so pretty in the spring. Everything's blooming. That's why I walked home that way – to see the flowers. Instead, I found that body. I still have no idea what could have done that to a person."
7,12,DEAN:,Do you recognize that man?
7,12,TERRY:,"Yeah. I mean, he lived on my parents' street. Mr. Snider."
7,12,DEAN:,Where'd you say your parents live?
7,12,DEAN:,"So, what exactly is this thing? Some sort of vampire who got too sucky?"
7,12,SAM:,"Nope. Coroner's reports said there was blood in both bodies. 300-year-old blood, but blood."
7,12,DEAN:,"Dude, dude. Uh, fedora dude."
7,12,DEAN:,"All right, let's do this. Let's move fast."
7,12,SAM:,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the plan here, exactly?"
7,12,DEAN:,Don't die.
7,12,DEAN:,"He's heading downtown. All right, you take the street. I'll take the alley. I'll meet you in the middle."
7,12,DEAN:,Son of a...
7,12,DEAN:,Hey!
7,12,DEAN:,Hey!
7,12,DEAN:,Hey!
7,12,POLICEMAN:,"Hey, you! Drop the gun! Put it down! Drop the gun!"
7,12,DEAN:,All right.
7,12,DEAN:,"Okay, can I just –"
7,12,POLICEMAN:,"Don't. Listen to me. Hey, if you tell me you're from the Bureau one more time, I'm gonna air you out myself. Got it?"
7,12,POLICEMAN:,"""No signal."" Are you some kind of Jerry spy?"
7,12,DEAN:,Jerry who?
7,12,POLICEMAN:,And a terrible one at that.
7,12,POLICEMAN:,"This badge was issued 68 years from now. Ace work, kraut-muncher."
7,12,DEAN:,'44? I'm stuck in 1944?!
7,12,POLICEMAN:,"We're all stuck in 1944, ya bunny."
7,12,MAN:,Take a powder.
7,12,POLICEMAN:,"Yes, sir."
7,12,DEAN:,"Look I don't even like frigging sauerkraut, okay, so you can just skip the –"
7,12,MAN:,What happened in the alley? And paint me a real picture.
7,12,DEAN:,"All right, well, I'm ""twelve monkeyed"" no matter what I say, so here goes. I was chasing this dude. Uh, I'd just seen him mummify a guy. Yeah. So, I jumped him. He lights up red. Poof, we're in 1944."
7,12,MAN:,Tell me more about the red light.
7,12,DEAN:,Are you seriously asking –
7,12,MAN:,"You want out of this jail, you're gonna tell me everything you can about that man and the so-called light."
7,12,DEAN:,"Okay. I saw it, and then we were here."
7,12,MAN:,"Would you say that, uh... it was all around you or that more that it came from inside this fella?"
7,12,DEAN:,You believe me. Are you...? You're a hunter.
7,12,MAN:,I don't know what you're talking about.
7,12,DEAN:,"Demons, ghosts, shifters. Hey, I've killed 'em all. And you're the same. Just 68 years before me, huh?"
7,12,MAN:,And your name is...?
7,12,DEAN:,Dean...Winchester.
7,12,MAN:,Ness. Eliot Ness.
7,12,DEAN:,"I-I got to tell you, I mean, ""Untouchables"" is, like, one of my most favorite movies ever."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,What?
7,12,DEAN:,"I must have seen that thing, like, 50 times."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"""Seen it?"" What, like, I'm in the –"
7,12,DEAN:,"Oh, yeah, yeah! You don't even know! Oh, you are – pbht!"
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"Look, hey, wait, wait, wait. Let's just... slow it down. Okay? Now, time travel. Is that something you find up a lot of sleeves in the future or...?"
7,12,DEAN:,"No, no, no. It's, uh, not normally on the menu. Trust me. I'm as surprised as you are that I'm here."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"So we're hunting the same thing, just in different centuries."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Two bodies. A few days apart just a little over a month ago. One witness said that she saw an assailant light up red after sucking the life out of a man.
7,12,DEAN:,Awesome.
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"How does that fill you with awe? Look, Dean, this thing, it kills –"
7,12,DEAN:,In threes.
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,In threes.
7,12,DEAN:,But you already know that.
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,He's two down. You're coming with me. We've got to get this thing before it grabs the last one.
7,12,DEAN:,"Okay, so, so, wait, uh... Does... does this mean that I'm an Untouchable now?"
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,It means we got to get you into some new clothes. You look like some kind of bindlestiff.
7,12,DEAN:,Stiff your br –  bin – what?
7,12,WOMAN:,"What's the rumpus, Eliot?"
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Ezra Moore. Dean Winchester.
7,12,DEAN:,Hey.
7,12,EZRA:,Who's he? Some farmer clown?
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"He's, uh, from the future."
7,12,DEAN:,"Yeah. Gas costs four bucks. You can get cheese out of a spray can.  And... the President, he's a black guy. I could go on."
7,12,EZRA:,Paint me impressed. I assume you need some clothes. Come on.
7,12,SAM:,"Hey, let me, uh – let me help you with those."
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"No, I got these. You go get the other 20 in my truck."
7,12,SAM:,Seriously?
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"Yeah. I think Bobby may have had a slight hoarding issue. I could barely get the door open on that storage locker. And, um, I'm pretty sure something's alive in at least three of those boxes."
7,12,DEAN:,Awesome.
7,12,EZRA:,"""Awesome""? You some religious kook?"
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"No, he just likes saying that."
7,12,EZRA:,"So, spill already. What bucket of syrup did you two idjits step into?"
7,12,EZRA:,"Something funny, sweetheart?"
7,12,DEAN:,"No, you, uh... You just kind of remind me of someone."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"Okay, Ezra... we need your help. It seems we're hunting a time traveler."
7,12,EZRA:,Delightful.
7,12,JODY MILLS:,Got it.
7,12,SAM:,Is that a – is that a ring on his finger?
7,12,JODY MILLS:,Um...
7,12,JODY MILLS:,Yeah.
7,12,SAM:,I know that symbol.
7,12,EZRA:,It's the infinite hourglass.
7,12,DEAN:,That's the symbol I saw on his ring.
7,12,EZRA:,"Yeah, that's the mark of Chronos."
7,12,DEAN:,Who?
7,12,SAM:,The God of time.
7,12,JODY MILLS:,That's crazy.
7,12,SAM:,"The thing is, with the Old Gods, once upon a time they were – they were just short of invincible. But they got a lot of their mojo from worshippers, from people feeding them."
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"These days, not so much."
7,12,SAM:,"Right, they're not what they used to be. But they make up for lack of power with being twice as pissed and a lot more hands-on."
7,12,JODY MILLS:,Okay. So why's this God killing people?
7,12,EZRA:,Could be he's killing folks for his time juice.
7,12,DEAN:,"All right, well, how the hell am I gonna ride him back to 2012?"
7,12,EZRA:,"Well, you could let him grab you, if you don't mind him using you for gasoline."
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"So, how do we get Dean back? How do we even find this Chronos?"
7,12,SAM:,Best stab? We find a way to summon a God.
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"Look, let's just stick with what we know. Ezra, see if you can find something in all this junk that will kill a God."
7,12,EZRA:,"No trouble at all. Come in a few hours, see what I can scrounge up."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"You said you fellas found his house? Well, let's go see if it's been built yet. And then let's kill that bastard, because that –"
7,12,DEAN:,Is the Chicago way.
7,12,EZRA:,"""Chicago way?"""
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Who talks like that?
7,12,DEAN:,Sean Connery.
7,12,EZRA:,Come on.
7,12,DEAN:,Never watch that movie again.
7,12,DEAN:,It looks empty. You got a lock pick?
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Sure.
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Take a look around. Where's he getting all the lettuce to support this?
7,12,DEAN:,"He's using the ""Biff strategy."""
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Using what?
7,12,DEAN:,He's – Chronos is betting on races he already knows the outcome of.
7,12,DEAN:,Look at this.
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,He's spent a lot of time in '44.
7,12,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,12,DEAN:,What's L.Y.?
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,It's not a what. It's a who. Lester Young. He lays bets for a lot of the flunkies in town. Let's say we go pay him a visit.
7,12,LESTER:,"Hey! W-whoa! Hey! Hey! Easy with the jacket! Yeah, I ain't talking. I'm no stoolie."
7,12,DEAN:,I learned it from watching you.
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"Look, you seem like a swell guy, Lester."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"And I want to help you out. I do, but my partner here? He just back from the war. And he's spent the last two years kicking in Nazi skulls. If he doesn't kick in a skull every couple days, he gets real touchy."
7,12,DEAN:,Lester. That a German name?
7,12,LESTER:,"Hey, okay, okay. There's no need to snap your cap. W-who you looking for?"
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Fella by the name of Snider.
7,12,LESTER:,"What, that guy? I mean, bum never missed a bet, but he gave me the heebie-jeebies, so I cut him off."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Where would you meet him for the payoff?
7,12,LESTER:,T-the Early Bird! It's a dive on Haggerty. Practically lives in the joint.
7,12,SAM:,Damn it.
7,12,JODY MILLS:,That's it!
7,12,SAM:,"Okay, yours sounds better. You first."
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"It says here that people could summon Chronos ""to compel him to tell them their futures."""
7,12,SAM:,And I've got the spell to do it right here.
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"So why the ""damn it""?"
7,12,SAM:,"'Cause calling Chronos isn't the problem. It's making sure we summon him when Dean is right there... Literally with his hands on the guy, so he can surf him back."
7,12,JODY MILLS:,That's not automatic?
7,12,SAM:,"No, it's more like we need to get the time on their end right to the exact second."
7,12,JODY MILLS:,Or we get an angry God but no big brother?
7,12,SAM:,And he's trapped there forever.
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"""Fine, you ass. You win for once. Enjoy. R."" Who's ""R""?"
7,12,SAM:,"Rufus, a family friend."
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"Ah, right."
7,12,SAM:,Wonder what they were betting over?
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"Well, whatever it was, Rufus sure was a sore loser."
7,12,SAM:,Yeah.
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"It's weird, huh? It's like their life's a big puzzle. You just keep finding pieces of it scattered all over the place. We should drink this. He'd want us to. Am I wrong?"
7,12,SAM:,It'd be rude not to.
7,12,DEAN:,That's him.
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Kind of puny for a God.
7,12,DEAN:,"Thought you were, uh – thought you were Mr. Boy Scout."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Why do you think I went after Capone in the first place? The guy had the best hooch in Chicago.
7,12,DEAN:,"So, now, w-who died in your life and made you a hunter?"
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"Who died? Nobody died, you morbid son of a bitch. I started doing this 'cause vampires were turning folks in Cleveland."
7,12,DEAN:,And you got the bug.
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,That's when I got the bug.
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"Sometimes you just want to punch through the red tape with a silver bullet. Yeah, hunting sets me free. Isn't that why you hunt?"
7,12,DEAN:,I used to do it 'cause that's what my family did.
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Hmm.
7,12,DEAN:,"But they just seem to keep dying. To tell you the truth, I don't know why I'm doing much of anything anymore."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"Boo-hoo. Cry me a river, ya nancy. Tell me, are all hunters as soft as you in the future? Everybody loses everybody. And then one day, boom. Your number's up, but at least you're making a difference. So enjoy it while it lasts, kid, 'cause hunting's the only clarity you're gonna find in this life. And that makes you luckier than most."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"Hello, nurse."
7,12,DEAN:,Hey.
7,12,DEAN:,Sweet merciful awesome.
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"Well, everything's coming up us, kid."
7,12,DEAN:,Talk to me.
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"I am. The owner of the house, Miss Lila Taylor, age 20, lives alone. Take the car, head back to Ezra, see what she's got. I'm gonna stay here and keep my peepers on the Sheik and the Sheba."
7,12,DEAN:,That's it?
7,12,EZRA:,"That is a 1,000-year-old olive carved by vestal virgins and dipped in the blood of – you don't want to know. Pulling this together wasn't easy. You and Ness both owe me, smoothie."
7,12,DEAN:,You can have whatever you want...
7,12,DEAN:,...soon as we gank this thing.
7,12,EZRA:,"Yeah, yeah. Take your twig, wise guy."
7,12,DEAN:,"Well, now, how's it work?"
7,12,EZRA:,"You stick this end in his heart. Miss, he has you for supper. Make sense?"
7,12,DEAN:,"Wait, if I – if I kill Chronos... I'm stuck here."
7,12,EZRA:,"You just now realized? Oh, come on. 1944 ain't so bad."
7,12,DEAN:,"Yeah, I could head over to Europe, punch Hitler in the neck."
7,12,EZRA:,"Oh, there's lots of ways to pass the time, sugar."
7,12,EZRA:,That's for luck.
7,12,EZRA:,'Cause I'm lucky.
7,12,DEAN:,Thanks.
7,12,DEAN:,"""Back to the Future III."""
7,12,DEAN:,I need to borrow some paper.
7,12,CHRONOS:,"Mr. Ness, I presume?"
7,12,CHRONOS:,"You know, I stopped by the police station to take care of that hunter who rode me here. I heard you took him out of jail. I thought I might see you again."
7,12,LILA:,Ethan?
7,12,LILA:,"There you are. Can't take the trash out without the trash, silly."
7,12,CHRONOS:,"Sorry, honey. I don't know where I left my head. Be right there."
7,12,CHRONOS:,"Sweetie, I want you to pack a bag."
7,12,LILA:,Excuse me?
7,12,CHRONOS:,"Well, you're always asking me where I go. Come with me tonight."
7,12,LILA:,Is...is everything okay?
7,12,CHRONOS:,"Yeah, everything's perfect. You're perfect. I just need you to pack a bag and I'll explain why on the way, okay?"
7,12,LILA:,But the diner –
7,12,CHRONOS:,"[raising his voice] Forget about them! [in a more normal tone] We'll call them tomorrow, okay? Just go. Pack."
7,12,DEAN:,Jackpot.
7,12,OLD MAN:,"Can I help you, son?"
7,12,DEAN:,"Yes, sir. I am, uh, Special Agent Costner with the, uh..."
7,12,DEAN:,...Department of Homeland Termite Invasion.
7,12,OLD MAN:,Termites?
7,12,DEAN:,"Yes, sir. There's been an outbreak all over this area, and I just want to do an inspection, make sure that the, uh, perimeter's secure."
7,12,OLD MAN:,"Yes. Yes, of course. Um, you'd better come in."
7,12,DEAN:,Okay.
7,12,OLD MAN:,Is everything okay up here?
7,12,DEAN:,"What?! Oh, yeah – no! No, no. Not to worry, because I'm going to install something that will protect this house forever."
7,12,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,12,JODY MILLS:,You are toast.
7,12,JODY MILLS:,I'll keep pushing. You go get some shut-eye.
7,12,SAM:,"Uh, that's okay. I can, uh..."
7,12,JODY MILLS:,Do I have to use my mom voice?
7,12,JODY MILLS:,All right. You asked for it. Young man –
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"""Sammy, turns out Snider is Chronos."" Wait, this is from Dean? How –"
7,12,SAM:,Just read!
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"""I rode him to 1944. Am working with Eliot Ness – yes, that one.”"
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"“Tracked down Chronos. He's banging some chick named Lila Taylor, and we got a weapon. We're going after him. Take care of yourself, Sam."""
7,12,SAM:,Look at the top.
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"November 5, '44."
7,12,SAM:,"So, now we know the exact date Dean had hands on Chronos. All we need is the exact time."
7,12,JODY MILLS:,Which we get how?
7,12,SAM:,Hoping...
7,12,SAM:,...we ask someone who was there.
7,12,JODY MILLS:,Miss Lila Taylor?
7,12,LILA:,"Oh, can you get ""The Sullivan Show""? I want to watch that Frankie Valli."
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"Um, actually..."
7,12,JODY MILLS:,...we're with the police.
7,12,LILA:,Oh. Is Michael in trouble again?
7,12,LILA:,I told him not to read those comic books.
7,12,JODY MILLS:,"Uh, no, no, no, no. He's, uh – he's fine. We'd wanted to ask you some questions about this man."
7,12,LILA:,Ethan. That's Ethan.
7,12,JODY MILLS:,Do you remember the last time you saw Ethan?
7,12,LILA:,Of course. November 1944 – the night the clocks stopped.
7,12,SAM:,Th-the clocks stopped?
7,12,LILA:,11:34. Every clock in the house.
7,12,SAM:,"Ma'am, can you tell us anything else you remember?"
7,12,LILA:,Ethan... said awful things. And then... and then he strangled that poor man.
7,12,SAM:,What poor man?
7,12,LILA:,Two policemen came to arrest Ethan.
7,12,SAM:,"Ma'am, was this one of them?"
7,12,LILA:,Ethan choked the life out of that man.
7,12,DEAN:,Ness! Ness!
7,12,LILA:,Ethan!
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Let's talk.
7,12,Sam:,"Here, break this."
7,12,CHRONOS:,Please don't hurt her.
7,12,LILA:,"Ethan, what's happening?"
7,12,DEAN:,"Yeah, Ethan. What the hell?"
7,12,CHRONOS:,"Lila, I'm sorry, but, you just – everything I said to you is true –"
7,12,DEAN:,"Oh, he might have left out a few details. He tell you he's a monster who jumps through time?"
7,12,CHRONOS:,"[shouting at DEAN] I'm a God! [speaking to LILA] Look, I'm not a monster. Listen. I'm the opposite."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"Well, don't forget to tell her about all the people you murdered along the way, boy scout."
7,12,LILA:,What?
7,12,CHRONOS:,"It's not like that. I do it for you, Lila."
7,12,LILA:,I don't understand.
7,12,DEAN:,"Well, he's not as strong as he used to be. Isn't that right, Ethan? Now you got to suck people dry. Wild guess – it takes three kills to juice you up."
7,12,CHRONOS:,"Sacrifices. Three sacrifices, and I can control when and where I land. But once I get there, it's never for long before I'm tossed through time again. That's my life, Lila. And all I want is to get back here."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Because you just love the clean Canton air?
7,12,CHRONOS:,"Because I love her! Because I lived the worst existence you can imagine, and then I found you."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"After you killed Tyler Crosby and Cathy Porter? Lila here was gonna be victim number three. Am I right? Don't act like you never killed a soul before you met her, pal. Something tells me you used to kill three saps just for a change of scenery."
7,12,CHRONOS:,"Yes, I did."
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,Back down.
7,12,CHRONOS:,"I-I used to wander, but now I have you."
7,12,LILA:,I knew Cathy. She used to come into the diner every day.
7,12,CHRONOS:,"Lila, please."
7,12,LILA:,You are a monster.
7,12,CHRONOS:,"No, Lila, please!"
7,12,CHRONOS:,No!
7,12,ELIOT NESS:,"Hey, Untouchable!"
7,12,JODY MILLS:,Dean!
7,12,SAM:,Hey!
7,12,CHRONOS:,"[shouting] No! [to DEAN, who is still on the floor, with JODY MILLS behind him supporting his head] You! Destroyed everything!"
7,12,SAM:,"Hey, Chronos?!"
7,12,SAM:,Was that the best you got?
7,12,CHRONOS:,You want to know your future? I know your future.
7,12,CHRONOS:,It's covered in thick black ooze.
7,12,CHRONOS:,It's everywhere.
7,12,CHRONOS:,They're everywhere.
7,12,CHRONOS:,Enjoy oblivion.
7,12,SAM,(taps on his phone) All right. (gasps) They're still in the business. Let's just hope they're still in that kind of business.
7,13,MAN:,"Barb, that you?"
7,13,SAM:,Morning.
7,13,DEAN:,Hey.
7,13,SAM:,Is that Bobby’s?
7,13,SAM:,I didn’t know you kept that.
7,13,DEAN:,"Yeah, mine sprung a leak."
7,13,SAM:,"You know, most people would just carry a – a photo or something for a memento."
7,13,DEAN:,"Shut up, man. I’m – I’m – I’m honoring the guy, all right? This is, uh, grief therapy, kind of like you and your wild-goose chase."
7,13,SAM:,Wild-goose chase?
7,13,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,13,SAM:,"Four guys murdered in two weeks, hands and feet cut off."
7,13,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, some guy with a foot fetish run amuck."
7,13,SAM:,Grown men thrown so hard they went through walls. Did you – did you even read the article?
7,13,DEAN:,"No, I was napping."
7,13,SAM:,"Well, anyway, what else you got going on? Dick Roman’s a dead end for now, you might as well –"
7,13,DEAN:,Stay busy.
7,13,SAM:,Exactly.
7,13,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,"The latest, but probably not the last. You guys always work this late?"
7,13,DEAN:,"Ugh, hours suck. But, uh, great benefits package."
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,Oh yeah?
7,13,DEAN:,Yeah. 10% co-pay on all drugs.
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,Seriously?
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,"Oh, but just generic, right?"
7,13,DEAN:,"No, no. Name brands are cool."
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,Oh.
7,13,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,13,SAM:,So. What’s our boy here weigh?
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,"Uh. A buck ninety. Thrown against a wall so hard it buckled. Based on the blood flow at the crime scene, the hands and feet were cut off while he was still alive, just like the others. The killer wanted him to suffer."
7,13,DEAN:,"And all vics are male, right, with the same kind of, uh, artwork as this?"
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,Yeah. Identical.
7,13,SAM:,"So, uh, DNA left at any of the scenes?"
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,"All of them. One before this, the guy bit the attacker. Still had a chunk of flesh in his teeth when he came in. That’s about as good as it gets."
7,13,DEAN:,Right.
7,13,SAM:,"So, we have a match?"
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,We do not.
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,The samples were rejected. The genetic markers don’t match anything we’ve ever seen.
7,13,DEAN:,Didn’t match any person in the database?
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,"No, I mean they don’t match anything human."
7,13,DEAN:,Hmm.
7,13,DEAN:,I’ll admit it could be in the general vicinity...
7,13,DEAN:,...of the ballpark of our kind of thing.
7,13,SAM:,"Yeah, uh, “didn’t match anything human” usually seals the deal for me. I don’t know, I’ve never seen this symbol before."
7,13,SAM:,"Let’s get a bite to eat, go back to the motel, haul out the laptop."
7,13,DEAN:,"That’s a great idea. Actually, that’s a brilliant idea. Here’s my counter. You do that, I’ll go undercover, go mingle amongst the locals and see, uh, what kind of clues bubble to the surface."
7,13,SAM:,You’re going to a bar.
7,13,DEAN:,Wow. If you want to oversimplify it.
7,13,WOMAN:,"Uh, dinner and a movie, which sounded fine, except the movie was “Human Centipede.”"
7,13,DEAN:,"What, so wait, uh, so you had a problem with that?"
7,13,WOMAN:,The date from hell.
7,13,DEAN:,"Dating, right? Ugh."
7,13,WOMAN:,But what’s the option? I don’t see settling down any time soon.
7,13,DEAN:,"Well, that’s something you don’t hear every day."
7,13,WOMAN:,"[Laughs] Oh, what, are you ready for the big commit?"
7,13,DEAN:,Me? [chuckles] Not exactly.
7,13,WOMAN:,"Nice suit, by the way. Guys don’t dress up much. I like it."
7,13,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, it’s, uh, a conservative line of work."
7,13,WOMAN:,What line is that?
7,13,DEAN:,Investment banking.
7,13,WOMAN:,"Oh, God."
7,13,DEAN:,[to waitress] Thanks.
7,13,WOMAN:,I hear the hours are ridic.
7,13,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,13,WOMAN:,But there’s money to be made.
7,13,DEAN:,I’ve had a fortunate year.
7,13,WOMAN:,Well.
7,13,WOMAN:,May you have many more.
7,13,DEAN:,Arigatou.
7,13,WOMAN:,You speak Japanese?
7,13,DEAN:,"Ah, enough to get by."
7,13,WOMAN:,"Well, look at you."
7,13,DEAN:,"Yeah, look at me."
7,13,WOMAN:,You want to move this conversation elsewhere?
7,13,MAN:,Hi. What can I do for you?
7,13,DEAN:,Ugh.
7,13,SAM:,You look like crap.
7,13,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, I feel worse than I look. I do recommend the Cobalt Room, by the way. Awesome night. Although I think I'm getting too old for this."
7,13,DEAN:,"Did you, uh, figure out that symbol?"
7,13,SAM:,"No. Um, we're gonna need an expert."
7,13,DEAN:,Expert? Our expert's dead.
7,13,POLICE OFFICER:,All right.
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,Comes off the wall down here...
7,13,DEAN:,"Well, nice decor. Very early slaughterhouse."
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,"[to the WOMAN OFFICER] FBI. [to SAM and DEAN] Guys, this is Charlene Penn. She's the lead on the case."
7,13,CHARLENE:,"More of the same. Uh, no forced entry. Thrown across the room. Made to suffer. Both hands and feet cut off."
7,13,SAM:,Same symbol in the chest.
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,"Mm. Whoever the killer is, the guy's a monster."
7,13,CHARLENE:,Excuse me.
7,13,DEAN:,"This guy's just like the last one. Early 30s, decent-looking?"
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,"Yeah. Just like the first three, you know? Fairly successful, no known enemies."
7,13,DEAN:,Hmm.
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,Here.
7,13,SAM:,[to the POLICE OFFICER] Excuse me. I got it. [to the NEIGHBOR] How can I help you?
7,13,NEIGHBOR:,I was just trying to find out what happened. Jerry was a friend.
7,13,SAM:,I'm very sorry. Jerry was killed sometime last night. Do you live nearby?
7,13,NEIGHBOR:,Yeah. Two doors down.
7,13,SAM:,"You, uh, you know anyone who would want to harm Jerry?"
7,13,NEIGHBOR:,"No. He was the nicest guy in the world. Well, his – his wife wasn't real happy with him."
7,13,SAM:,Why's that?
7,13,NEIGHBOR:,"A few nights ago, he has a little one-night fling. Ann found out, took off. But... she would never do anything like..."
7,13,SAM:,Yeah. Of course. Thanks.
7,13,DEAN:,Who was that?
7,13,SAM:,Neighbor. Said the vic's wife caught him cheating.
7,13,DEAN:,"Yeah, but we're not thinking it's the wife."
7,13,SAM:,Not unless she benches 350 and did the other guys as a warm-up.
7,13,DEAN:,Shoot. I left Bobby's flask over at Lydia's.
7,13,SAM:,Lydia?
7,13,DEAN:,My workout partner from last night.
7,13,DEAN:,Now I've got to go get it.
7,13,SAM:,"So, not only do you know her name, you're actually gonna call her?"
7,13,DEAN:,Bite me.
7,13,SAM:,"Oh, how sweet – she gave you her number."
7,13,DEAN:,They always give you their number.
7,13,DEAN:,She's real busy.
7,13,WOMAN:,Breathe.
7,13,LYDIA:,
7,13,WOMAN:,"Control, Lydia. As in all things."
7,13,WOMAN:,One final push.
7,13,LYDIA:,Aah!
7,13,WOMAN:,The pain is an honor.
7,13,LYDIA:,What will we call her?
7,13,WOMAN:,You'll call her Emma. Next.
7,13,PROFESSOR (V-O):,Fascinating. Truly.
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"And actually, rather accomplished draftsmanship."
7,13,DEAN:,"Yeah, if you get past the fact that it was carved into a guy's body."
7,13,SAM:,"Professor Morrison, we're hoping you can tell us what the symbol means."
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"Ah, maybe."
7,13,SAM:,Maybe?
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"It's possible I could, even likely. Is the FBI offering suitable remuneration?"
7,13,SAM:,The respect of a grateful nation.
7,13,DEAN:,And a good word with the I.R.S.
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"Ah. Well, it appears quite ancient."
7,13,DEAN:,"Well, that narrows it down."
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"A corrupted version of symbology associated with worship. Definitely an obscure regional script. Oh, this will require some research."
7,13,SAM:,"All right. Great. Well, uh, I guess we'll be seeing you tomorrow."
7,13,PROFESSOR:,Tomorrow? [laughs] I've spent entire sabbaticals on a project like this.
7,13,DEAN:,Professor! We have a serial killer on our hands.
7,13,SAM:,"Your government needs you, sir."
7,13,PROFESSOR:,Gentlemen. My housekeeper needs a green card.
7,13,DEAN:,"Good God, where'd you find this guy?"
7,13,SAM:,He's supposed to be a top expert in his field.
7,13,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, when his field includes things that go bump in the night, he's gonna be worth the breath we just wasted."
7,13,SAM:,"So, what are we supposed to do, Dean? Spin our wheels?"
7,13,SAM:,"Dean, you know what? I want to call him, too, okay? Believe me. But Bobby's not here. So we're settling."
7,13,DEAN:,Yeah. We sure are.
7,13,DEAN:,"Damn it, why hasn't she called?"
7,13,DEAN:,I think you're enjoying this a little more than you need to. Screw it. I'm going over there and getting the flask.
7,13,LYDIA:,Don.
7,13,DEAN:,Dean. I guess you didn't get my messages.
7,13,LYDIA:,"No, I did. I've been busy."
7,13,DEAN:,"Oh. Anyway, I, uh, left that flask over here the other night."
7,13,LYDIA:,"Yes. I found it. It was so beat up and old, I almost tossed it."
7,13,DEAN:,"Yeah, well, guy it belonged to was beat up and old, too. But I was very close with him, and I'd, uh, I'd hate to lose it."
7,13,LYDIA:,I'll get it for you.
7,13,DEAN:,"So, how you been? Other than ""busy."""
7,13,LYDIA:,Just that. Really busy. Here you go.
7,13,DEAN:,"Oh, wow. I can see why you're busy. You've been babysitting, huh?"
7,13,LYDIA:,No.
7,13,DEAN:,Yours?
7,13,LYDIA:,Uh-huh.
7,13,DEAN:,You didn't tell me you had a little girl.
7,13,LYDIA:,There's probably all kinds of things we didn't tell each other.
7,13,DEAN:,What's her name?
7,13,LYDIA:,Emma.
7,13,DEAN:,"Hi, Emma. Your first?"
7,13,LYDIA:,Yes.
7,13,DEAN:,"Well, I hear they grow like weeds."
7,13,LYDIA:,You have no idea.
7,13,DEAN:,Oh. Sorry. I got to take this.
7,13,EMMA:,"Mom, get me out!  [?]"
7,13,LYDIA:,Shh. Just a minute. [?]
7,13,EMMA:,Who's that guy in the other room?
7,13,LYDIA:,Shh.
7,13,EMMA:,Who is that?
7,13,LYDIA:,Shh! Don't talk. We'll discuss it later.
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,"So, again, we got a guy weighing about two bills, thrown into a wall so hard, he's got pieces of plaster lodged in his skull."
7,13,CHARLENE:,What triggered the Feds' involvement in this case? I always think you boys have bigger fish to fry.
7,13,SAM:,"No. Actually, we – we – it’s –"
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,"I just figured it was the similarity to the other cold cases? If it's the same killer, then he crossed state lines – that would bring you guys in."
7,13,SAM:,
7,13,CHARLENE:,Yeah. Whatever. You're gonna have to wrap this up. Your case isn't the only one we're working on.
7,13,FORENSICS OFFICER:,You get used to her.
7,13,SAM:,"Uh, so, Eddie, by the way, I didn't bring the cold-case files with me. Is there a chance you have a copy?"
7,13,EDDIE:,Yeah.
7,13,SAM:,Great.
7,13,SAM:,The Cobalt Room.
7,13,EDDIE:,"Mm! Yeah, it's pretty well known. Looking to hook up, it's a pretty good place to go."
7,13,SAM:,I've heard.
7,13,EDDIE:,Vic number two was there.
7,13,EDDIE:,"And according to his security guard, he left with a hot girl. Two days later, he's an obituary."
7,13,SAM:,Same with Jerry Price.
7,13,EDDIE:,"Mm-hmm. And, uh, as far as we can tell, at least a couple of those in there."
7,13,SAM:,Same thing in Chicago.
7,13,EDDIE:,"Yep. A lot of busted marriages, flings with unknown women, that kind of thing, all just before they got offed."
7,13,SAM:,Thanks.
7,13,WOMAN:,Is Emma ready?
7,13,LYDIA:,Yes. Come in.
7,13,WOMAN:,Thank you.
7,13,SAM:,Nice talk.
7,13,LYDIA:,"Emma, hurry up. Come on, Emma. Time to go."
7,13,LYDIA:,Emma. You be a good girl. Make us proud.
7,13,EMMA:,"I will, momma."
7,13,LYDIA:,"Bye, Emma."
7,13,DEAN:,I hate when this happens.
7,13,SAM:,"So what? I mean, so maybe she has another kid she didn't tell you about."
7,13,DEAN:,"Nope, just the one. Emma. But that night, when I was with her, she didn't have any. And I was at her place, man. There was no playpens, no blankets, no rubber ducks."
7,13,SAM:,Right. Like you would have been focused on that kind of thing.
7,13,DEAN:,"Then, all of a sudden, boom – baby."
7,13,SAM:,"Yeah, the one you thought talked."
7,13,DEAN:,"Oh, it talked. And not baby talk, either."
7,13,SAM:,Now you know so much about child development?
7,13,DEAN:,"Lydia's handing this kid who's calling her mommy over to these two women, right? But this is not a baby. No, no, this kid's got to be five. And same name – Emma."
7,13,SAM:,"You know, George Foreman named all his sons George."
7,13,DEAN:,Are you deliberately messing with me?
7,13,DEAN:,"Dude, I know weird. Okay? There is no non-weird explanation for this. This morning, Emma was a baby. By sunset, she's Hannah Montana. Early years."
7,13,SAM:,It's the Professor.
7,13,DEAN:,"Oh. Good. The Professor. Yeah, I'm sure he'll crack this wide open."
7,13,SAM:,Shh!
7,13,WOMAN:,"On this special night, you join an exceptional family. You are ready to take your places alongside us and learn our traditions."
7,13,WOMAN:,This is a tribute to the one who created and protects us.
7,13,WOMAN:,We hunt for her. We kill for her. And now we consume that kill as a symbol of unity with those who have completed their blood missions and furthered the life of the tribe.
7,13,WOMAN:,"Go ahead, Emma. You need to eat."
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"You know, identifying the scroll was no day at the beach. Lesser scholars would have crumbled."
7,13,SAM:,Professor... the symbol?
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"It's a variation of a symbol associated with the Greek Pantheon, the temple of the goddess Harmonia. According to myth, the coupling of Harmonia and Ares, the God of war, produced the Amazons."
7,13,SAM:,The Amazons?
7,13,DEAN:,Like Wonder Woman?
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"No, like – like a tribe of warriors. They actually existed. The comic books – they're just silly perversions. The symbol –"
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"I believe it originated with the Amazons. Pictographs meant to pay homage to Harmonia – occult talismans, if you will. They had an exclusively female culture. No use for men whatsoever, except procreation."
7,13,SAM:,All the vics were male.
7,13,PROFESSOR:,So you said – with this symbol carved in their chests.
7,13,SAM:,And their hands and feet cut off.
7,13,DEAN:,Got our attention.
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"After they were impregnated, they killed the male – first cutting off certain body parts."
7,13,DEAN:,I know Bobby's got a Grecian encyclopedia of weird in here. I saw it last time I was looking through this stupid... Would it kill him to have a system?
7,13,DEAN:,You got anything?
7,13,SAM:,"Uh, yeah."
7,13,SAM:,There's this whole crazy side to Amazon lore that Professor Morrison didn't even mention.
7,13,DEAN:,"That's 'cause he doesn't believe in it, which is a real handicap when you're trying to deal with it."
7,13,SAM:,"[after a pause] Right. Um, apparently, there was this long, bloody war. The Amazon population was decimated, so they made a bargain with Harmonia to replenish their ranks and make them stronger."
7,13,DEAN:,"Well, I'd say throwing grown men through walls was stronger."
7,13,SAM:,"Yeah. Well, basically, they became more than human. Harmonia turned them into monsters."
7,13,DEAN:,Can you kill them like humans? Or is there some kind of trick?
7,13,SAM:,"Uh,  doesn't say. No idea. I guess it could go either way."
7,13,DEAN:,"Well, that's helpful. What else?"
7,13,SAM:,"The lore says they reproduced quickly – as in, after mating, they gave birth within 36 hours."
7,13,SAM:,"The babies grew incredibly fast, then the aging process became normal. Which is one way to make an army, I guess. The mating cycle is every two years. They send out all the women who have reached child-bearing age."
7,13,DEAN:,"Which lines up, 'cause this happens every couple of years in different towns, right?"
7,13,SAM:,Yeah. And we know for sure that at least some of the vics hooked up with strange women days before being killed Amazon style.
7,13,DEAN:,"Hooked up in the same bar I met Lydia, right?"
7,13,SAM:,Yeah.
7,13,DEAN:,And then suddenly...
7,13,DEAN:,...she's got a little baby in like fruit-fly time. That baby turns into a little girl just as fast.
7,13,SAM:,"Wow. So maybe you're – you’re, uh..."
7,13,DEAN:,Don't say it.
7,13,SAM:,"Look, if that kid's yours –"
7,13,DEAN:,I said don't say it!
7,13,SAM:,"Fine. I won't. But, Dean... Dude, seriously, a one-night stand, you're just gonna... roll the dice? You don't even –"
7,13,DEAN:,"Of course not... Sam. What, do you think I'm brain-dead? Accidents happen. If one even did, which I-I-I don't think..."
7,13,DEAN:,No. You know what? We’re – stop. We're not gonna talk about this anymore because my skin's starting to crawl!
7,13,SAM:,"All right, fine. But if it's true, if it happened..."
7,13,DEAN:,I know. I got to hang on to my hands and feet.
7,13,AMAZON LEADER:,We are so pleased with your progress.
7,13,AMAZON LEADER:,You are absorbing the traditions of our mothers...
7,13,AMAZON LEADER:,"...and you are close to fulfilling your tribal destiny, and taking your place alongside your sisters. Today, you are a warrior."
7,13,AMAZON LEADER:,"Though you may walk among others, your heart is only with the tribe."
7,13,AMAZON LEADER:,"Soon, you will take the final, glorious step into adulthood."
7,13,AMAZON LEADER:,"Today, you will learn how to endure pain and how to inflict it."
7,13,AMAZON LEADER:,"Fight it, Emma. As with all you do, courage is everything."
7,13,DEAN:,Looking through Bobby's files is like dumpster diving.
7,13,SAM:,"Yeah, tell me about it. So, it makes sense why, uh, why..."
7,13,SAM:,"... the Amazons all want to hook up with decent-looking, successful guys."
7,13,DEAN:,"Oh, they're picky about the gene pool?"
7,13,SAM:,Right.  So...
7,13,SAM:,...what was Lydia doing with you?
7,13,DEAN:,"Well, she may or may not have thought I was a rich investment banker."
7,13,DEAN:,Sam.
7,13,SAM:,Yeah.
7,13,DEAN:,These papers just moved.
7,13,SAM:,What?
7,13,DEAN:,I didn't touch them.
7,13,SAM:,It's all over the place.
7,13,SAM:,Redline. Redline.
7,13,SAM:,...that could have moved the papers.
7,13,DEAN:,Did you feel a breeze?
7,13,SAM:,"It doesn't matter, Dean. The readings are useless."
7,13,DEAN:,"Hey. Maybe, uh..."
7,13,SAM:,"We burned him, Dean."
7,13,DEAN:,So what?
7,13,SAM:,"So, what are you suggesting?"
7,13,DEAN:,I don't know. What are you?
7,13,SAM:,Concentrate on something else.
7,13,DEAN:,Why?
7,13,SAM:,Because it's [raising his voice and stepping close to DEAN] not Bobby!
7,13,DEAN:,Could be.
7,13,DEAN:,Why not?
7,13,DEAN:,Maybe it's useful.
7,13,SAM:,"It's in a pile of ""maybe it's useful."" Besides, it's in Greek. Nobody reads Greek."
7,13,DEAN:,"Yeah, except Greeks. Oh, and Bobby."
7,13,SAM:,And Professor Morrison.
7,13,DEAN:,Really?
7,13,SAM:,"I'm going, Dean. You stay here, keep the door locked. Don't go anywhere. I mean it."
7,13,DEAN:,Fine.
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"Oh, you have got to be kidding."
7,13,PROFESSOR:,I have office hours tomorrow –
7,13,SAM:,"I'm sorry, Professor. I need your help."
7,13,PROFESSOR:,The FBI isn't paying me enough for this.
7,13,SAM:,All right. I'll sweeten the deal. We'll remove your wiretap.
7,13,EMMA:,"Hi. You don't know me, but my name is Emma. I need your help. I think I'm in trouble, and you're the only person I can trust."
7,13,DEAN:,Why?
7,13,EMMA:,Because you're my father.
7,13,DEAN:,How'd you find me?
7,13,EMMA:,"They've been watching you, ever since Mom got pregnant."
7,13,DEAN:,"Well, if you're such a prisoner, you mind telling me how you escaped?"
7,13,EMMA:,I waited until lights out. The women who watch over us change shifts a little after 10:00.
7,13,DEAN:,Uh-huh. And you left because...?
7,13,EMMA:,"They stick you in there, and you trust them. It's all you know. And you don't question what they want you to do – terrible things. That's why I had to leave. They tortured me."
7,13,EMMA:,They told me I had to endure pain so I could be strong like them. But I don't want to be like them.
7,13,DEAN:,"Okay. Come on in.
EMMA enters the room. DEAN closes the door, replaces the security chain and puts his gun in the back of his jeans."
7,13,DEAN:,Have a seat.
7,13,DEAN:,Okay. Let's assume that you're not... like them. Yet.
7,13,DEAN:,What do you want me to do?
7,13,EMMA:,Get me away from here. You're a good man. My mother told me that.
7,13,DEAN:,"I seriously doubt she said that. And if you knew me, you would seriously doubt it's true."
7,13,EMMA:,They told me you're a hunter. So maybe you'll understand about me. Maybe you can protect me. Just long enough so I can get away. Then I'll leave you alone. I know you don't want me.
7,13,DEAN:,"All right, let's not... go there, okay? This isn't a matter of..."
7,13,DEAN:,"You get this isn't a normal situation, right?"
7,13,EMMA:,"How would I know? Three days ago, I wasn't even alive. Now here I am. My mother threw me into that place. And my father... well... You get this is my last chance to have anything normal ever, right?"
7,13,PROFESSOR:,It's fascinating.
7,13,SAM:,What's it say?
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"Oh, I haven't gotten there yet. The paper is handmade. A cellulose, rather like papyrus, which would explain its durability."
7,13,SAM:,Professor –
7,13,PROFESSOR:,Wherever did you get it?
7,13,SAM:,"Uh... a – a crazy, drunk, old genius."
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"Yeah. They always have the good stuff. Well, it's in Greek."
7,13,SAM:,"Yeah, yeah. I-I know that."
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"Not a common dialect. My God, what is it with you and Amazons?"
7,13,SAM:,"Professor, it's important."
7,13,PROFESSOR:,"At 11:30 at night, it better be.
Oh, here's a new twist. It repeats the conventional lore. Amazon warriors mate with males. The males are murdered. Yada, yada. But according to this... It's not the women who do the killing. Instead, a ritual of initiation requires that the child born of the mating process must kill her own father."
7,13,SAM:,What?
7,13,DEAN:,You look exhausted.
7,13,EMMA:,And starving. It's been a tough sweet 16. So you believe me?
7,13,EMMA:,You'll help me?
7,13,DEAN:,If you really want help.
7,13,SAM:,Detective.
7,13,CHARLENE:,Agent. You're here late.
7,13,SAM:,"Yeah. Listen, could we talk in the morning?"
7,13,CHARLENE:,What's your hurry...
7,13,CHARLENE:,...Sam? Sam Winchester. Let's see. I could run you in for impersonating a federal agent.
7,13,DEAN:,"Well, now, what happens when they find out you're missing?"
7,13,EMMA:,They may have already found out. And they'll hunt me down.
7,13,EMMA:,"Look, I know this is gonna be hard, but if I'm gonna get out, I have to do it now."
7,13,DEAN:,We got cheese and a leftover burrito.
7,13,EMMA:,Doesn't make a difference.
7,13,DEAN:,You were asking if I believed you.
7,13,EMMA:,I was told you'd be a challenge.
7,13,DEAN:,I figured you'd chat me up... try and catch me off guard. Almost worked. I was expecting your mother.
7,13,DEAN:,Is that what they told you?
7,13,EMMA:,It's what I am.
7,13,DEAN:,"Well, then, I should just kill you right now."
7,13,EMMA:,Sure. But you could have done that 30 seconds ago.
7,13,EMMA:,"It's weirdly hard, isn't it? It is for me."
7,13,DEAN:,Knock it off.
7,13,EMMA:,How could it not be? You're my father.
7,13,DEAN:,Hey! We're not gonna do that.
7,13,EMMA:,But it's true.
7,13,EMMA (V-O):,You're the reason that we're standing here.
7,13,EMMA:,I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. So now someone has to kill someone.
7,13,EMMA:,"You know what? So far, my childhood's been kind of disappointing."
7,13,DEAN:,"You haven't killed anybody yet, Emma. Walk away."
7,13,DEAN (V-O):,Right now. I won't go after you.
7,13,EMMA:,I can't. I don't have a choice.
7,13,EMMA:,Please don't let him hurt me.
7,13,DEAN:,Here's the mother ship.
7,13,SAM:,Let's get this done.
7,13,DEAN:,They're gone.
7,13,DEAN:,"Hey, you know what? I don't like it, either. I wanted to torch ’em just as much as you. Yeah, but, hey... next time they surface, we'll be ready. If we live that long."
7,13,DEAN:,"All right, fine. Just sit there and be pissed."
7,13,SAM:,"Oh, the hell you were! You think I'm an idiot?"
7,13,SAM:,"Dean, you were gonna let her walk!"
7,13,DEAN:,"No, I wasn't. That's ridiculous!"
7,13,SAM:,"Look, man, she was not yours. Not really."
7,13,SAM:,"You know what? Bobby was right. Your head's not in it, man. When Cas died, you were wobbly, but now..."
7,13,SAM:,What?!
7,13,DEAN:,I don't know.
7,13,SAM:,"Look... Dean, the thing is, tonight... It almost got you killed. Now, I don't care how you deal. I really, really don't. But just don't – don't get killed."
7,13,DEAN:,I'll do what I can.
7,13,SAM:,"Well, what's that supposed to mean?"
7,13,DEAN:,It means I'll do what I can. All right? You can shut up about it.
7,14,SAM:,"[out loud to himself] It's okay. They can't hurt you. They can't hurt you. ""If it bleeds, you can kill it.""  Yeah. ""If it bleeds, you can kill it."""
7,14,DEAN:,I hope he finds something quick. This whole protocol du jour thing's really creeping my cheese.
7,14,SAM:,"So, we got dick on Dick?"
7,14,DEAN:,That's a vivid way of putting it. You find anything on Wonder Woman?
7,14,SAM:,No. And there probably won't be. They are definitely gone. But...
7,14,SAM:,...I might have found something over in Kansas.
7,14,DEAN:,"All right, well, let's do it. But, uh, a few simple rules, okay? No babies."
7,14,DEAN:,"In fact, no baby mamas. No bars. No booze – no hot chicks of any kind."
7,14,SAM:,"Wait, wait, wait. Did you just say –"
7,14,DEAN:,Ohh. Those are not the fun kind of hickeys.
7,14,DEAN:,And for those of us who skipped the enteroctopus class?
7,14,DOCTOR:,Giant Pacific octopus.
7,14,DEAN:,"How giant we talking, Doc?"
7,14,DOCTOR:,Approximately 30 feet.
7,14,SAM:,"I mean, aren't... giant octopi rare around here?"
7,14,DOCTOR:,Yet here we are.
7,14,DEAN:,"All right, so what happens? Guy comes home, cracks a beer, and gets... suckered to death?"
7,14,DOCTOR:,"Obviously, this was some kind of freak fetish attack. Someone created those hickey marks, then bled the man out."
7,14,DEAN:,That bite look a little vamp-y to you?
7,14,SAM:,"Yeah, no question."
7,14,DEAN:,So what are we looking for? An octovamp? A vamptopus?
7,14,SAM:,"That's crazy even for us, right?"
7,14,DEAN:,It does push the envelope. Let's go chat up the widow.
7,14,SAM:,"We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am."
7,14,DEAN:,"Mrs. Harper, we know this is, uh, bad timing. But we just have a few routine questions that we need to ask you – is that okay?"
7,14,MRS HARPER:,Yeah.
7,14,SAM:,Did the house feel any different lately?
7,14,MRS HARPER:,Different...?
7,14,DEAN:,"Anything strange. Cold spots. Uh, did you smell anything weird? Maybe sulfury?"
7,14,MRS HARPER:,No. Not that I can remember.
7,14,DEAN:,"Okay, we're just ticking all the boxes here. Um, what about any skeletons in your husband's closet?"
7,14,MRS HARPER:,Skeletons? What do you mean?
7,14,DEAN:,"Can you think of anybody who would want to do him harm? A colleague, an old flame."
7,14,SAM:,The tiniest detail could really help.
7,14,MRS HARPER:,You want to know what he was up to lately? Ask Stacey. She was here the night he died.
7,14,SAM:,Um... Stacey?
7,14,MRS HARPER:,Our nanny. Any other questions?
7,14,DEAN:,"No, that's... Thank you. You've been a big help."
7,14,SAM:,"Really appreciate the hospitality, ma'am."
7,14,DEAN:,"Mom, dad, nanny – boy, that is a love triangle right out of Casa Erotica. 'Course, in those, the jealous wife tends to channel her feelings more productively."
7,14,SAM:,The only thing I can't wrap my mind around is –
7,14,DEAN:,"What, how wife lady summoned an octovamp?"
7,14,SAM:,"More like ""why?"" I mean, kind of impractical, right?"
7,14,DEAN:,"Yeah. All right, one of us needs to go talk to the naughty nanny."
7,14,DEAN:,"The other one stay here, shake down the place when the wife leaves – see what we're dealing with."
7,14,SAM:,All right. I'm on the nanny.
7,14,DEAN:,I'm on the nanny.
7,14,SAM:,I thought you said no hot chicks.
7,14,DEAN:,We don't know that she's hot.
7,14,DEAN:,"Now, uh, how would you describe your relationship with the deceased?"
7,14,NANNY:,"I don't know. Normal, I guess."
7,14,DEAN:,Normal?
7,14,NANNY:,"Well, I mostly dealt with Debra. There was nothing going on, if that's what you mean."
7,14,DEAN:,"Debra said that you were at the house late the night that, uh, that Brian died."
7,14,NANNY:,"Yeah. Brian was working late, so I stayed with Kelly. She was pretty upset."
7,14,DEAN:,Why's that?
7,14,NANNY:,"Well, it was her birthday. We had a party at Plucky's."
7,14,DEAN:,Plucky's. Why does that sound familiar?
7,14,NANNY:,"Plucky Pennywhistle's Magical Menagerie? Pizza chain for kids. Actually, more for lazy parents. Anyway, her dad showed up for five minutes, then he went back to work. And, of course, her mom was out of town. This stupid kid told Kelly her folks didn't really love her. She freaked. I was calming her down for hours."
7,14,DEAN:,"Uh, did you...notice anything weird at the house?"
7,14,NANNY:,Weird like...?
7,14,DEAN:,Anything. Even a bad feeling.
7,14,NANNY:,"No, nothing like that. Actually, Kelly does have a weird thing about closets. But it's just kid stuff."
7,14,DEAN:,Try me.
7,14,NANNY:,She thinks there's a monster in her closet. It drives everyone crazy.
7,14,SAM:,Whatcha working on there?
7,14,KELLY:,I know who you are.
7,14,SAM:,You do?
7,14,KELLY:,Mm-hmm. You're the guy that talked to my mom.
7,14,SAM:,That's right. I did.
7,14,MRS HARPER:,"[from inside house] Kelly! Where are you, honey?"
7,14,SAM:,Something wrong?
7,14,KELLY:,My mom will get mad if I talk to you.
7,14,SAM:,Um... How come?
7,14,KELLY:,Because of what I told the police.
7,14,SAM:,And what did you tell the police?
7,14,KELLY:,I told them that I tried to warn my dad. That the monster would get him.
7,14,MRS HARPER:,Kelly. Come here! Now! Kelly!
7,14,CLOWN:,Aah! Ha!
7,14,SAM:,"""If it bleeds, you can kill it."""
7,14,DEAN:,Huh.
7,14,DEAN:,"So, what, like a lance?"
7,14,POLICE OFFICER:,It's sad. Lady's got to pull her friggin' 8-year-old out of school and tell him his dad's dead.
7,14,DEAN:,Excuse me.
7,14,DEAN:,"Excuse me, ma'am? Agent Jones, FBI."
7,14,WIDOW:,I'm sorry. I – I really need to go.
7,14,DEAN:,"Okay. Uh, just one quick question, if you don't mind. Um, was yesterday your son's birthday?"
7,14,WIDOW:,Billy's birthday? No. Why would you ask that?
7,14,DEAN:,Nothing. Never mind.
7,14,WIDOW:,Oh. But... his father did take him to a friend's birthday party yesterday.
7,14,SAM:,
7,14,SAM:,I'm too old for this.
7,14,HOWARD:,"Welcome to Plucky’s, where all your dreams are good."
7,14,SAM:,"Could you just, uh, maybe..."
7,14,SAM:,...just get the manager for me?
7,14,SAM:,Okay.
7,14,WOMAN:,I just need you to stay sane for three more hours. Okay? Here. Finish your homework.
7,14,YOUNG BOY:,Like I can concentrate in here.
7,14,MANAGER:,"Real beauties, huh? We rotate them out once a week. Kids love having their art on the wall."
7,14,SAM:,"""Draw your worst fear""?"
7,14,JEAN:,I know. But we don't post the truly evil stuff – just the standard crap like sharks and ghosts.
7,14,JEAN:,"Jean Holiday, shift manager."
7,14,SAM:,"Johnson, FBI.  So tell me – why even ask the kids to draw creepy stuff to begin with?"
7,14,JEAN:,"It's just an exercise... some pop psychologist came up with. Plus, the owner's obsessed with ""aiding children's development."" So, the place mat is a safe way to get kids to talk about their fears. You know, we get them to sketch it in a little box, and – voila! – Plucky magically transforms it into rainbows and candy. Personally, I think it's a load of hooey, but they say that if these fears run wild, then it affects kids long into their adulthood."
7,14,SAM:,"Yeah, I've – I've – I've heard that. Um... so, I – I don't know if you'll remember, but there was a – a kid in here yesterday named Billy Pogue for a party?"
7,14,JEAN:,"Oh, the conniption kid."
7,14,SAM:,Conniption? He – he had –
7,14,JEAN:,"No, no, no, not him. He was fine. It was his dad. He pulls the kid away before cake and presents, and I guess the kid asked to stay for another five minutes. The dad pulls a full-frontal douchebag, starts screaming. Just embarrassed for the kid."
7,14,JANITOR:,Hey. [whistles again] Hey.
7,14,JANITOR:,You a cop?
7,14,SAM:,"Uh, yeah. I'm a Fed."
7,14,JANITOR:,"Uh, what are you investigating?"
7,14,SAM:,"Couple of crazy deaths. Why, is there something you want to share?"
7,14,JANITOR:,Look – not now. Too many eyes. Come back after closing.
7,14,DEAN:,"Hey. So, what's the lowdown with trauma town?"
7,14,SAM:,"I can tell you this much. Neither vic was up for parent of the year. Kelly's dad skipped her birthday, and Billy's dad pulled one of those Dick Parent scenes that makes everyone cringe."
7,14,DEAN:,What the hell are these?
7,14,SAM:,"Kid therapy. Um, you draw your worst nightmare – poof! – Plucky fixes it. Um, they hang them up on this big wall."
7,14,DEAN:,"Okay, so, Kelly draws a monster, and then that goes after her father? That's what we're saying?"
7,14,SAM:,"Well, here's the thing. They label those. And guess which two were missing. Well, name tag was there – no place mat."
7,14,DEAN:,Little Miss Octovamp.
7,14,SAM:,"Yeah. And... Billy. So... somehow, whatever he drew came to life and killed his dad, riding a horse."
7,14,DEAN:,"Close, but no Seabiscuit. See, I went and had a little chat with Billy. And he drew me this."
7,14,SAM:,Wait. So now unicorns are evil?
7,14,DEAN:,Yeah. Obviously.
7,14,SAM:,"Great. Well, now the question is, how did a unicorn come off a sketch and kill Billy's dad? How's any of this happening?"
7,14,JANITOR:,"Well, that's it for me. Guess I'll head out."
7,14,JEAN:,"Uh, one more thing. Some kid puked in the ball pit. It's gonna need a full sanitization. Do that, and then you can clock out."
7,14,JANITOR:,Aah! Aah.
7,14,DEAN:,"Hold on one second there, guys."
7,14,SAM:,Keep in touch.
7,14,SAM:,"Uh, thank you."
7,14,DEAN:,So?
7,14,SAM:,The manager found the body in the ball pit. Blood everywhere.
7,14,DEAN:,Cops have a theory?
7,14,SAM:,"Yeah, they think the ball washer did it."
7,14,DEAN:,The what?
7,14,SAM:,The... ball washer.
7,14,DEAN:,[smiling] The what?
7,14,SAM:,The ball –
7,14,DEAN:,Look at this.
7,14,DEAN:,"Thank you, gentlemen."
7,14,DEAN:,That's a shark bite.
7,14,SAM:,Yeah.
7,14,DEAN:,"And, uh, judging from the radius, I'd say a 20-footer, at least."
7,14,DEAN:,"""Shark Week,"" man. How do you not watch that?"
7,14,DEAN:,Whole week of sharks.
7,14,SAM:,Omar Cooper. How much you want to bet little Omar here was scared of sharks?
7,14,DEAN:,"Saul the janitor is connected how? I mean, he's not related to Omar."
7,14,SAM:,No. But Saul had something he wanted to tell me.
7,14,DEAN:,So this isn't about ganking some dickweed parent.
7,14,SAM:,"More like, uh, silencing a whistle-blower?"
7,14,DEAN:,"Great, so whatever we're looking for can literally fire off childhood fears at will. Wow. Watch out for evil lunch ladies."
7,14,SAM:,All right. Let's comb this place.
7,14,DEAN:,Seriously. Dractopus. Seabiscuit the impaler. Land shark – what's next?
7,14,LIBBY:,"Okay, Tyler, that's it. You got to take the bus from here."
7,14,TYLER:,But I thought –
7,14,LIBBY:,I can't. I'm sorry. I'm late.
7,14,LIBBY:,Here.
7,14,LIBBY:,Stay out of trouble.
7,14,SAM:,Maybe a... Tulpa?
7,14,DEAN:,"No, killings are too spread out."
7,14,SAM:,True. Um... angel?
7,14,DEAN:,"It's a little imaginative for the God squad, don't you think?"
7,14,SAM:,All right. So... what?
7,14,DEAN:,"Yeah, I don't know. I'm tapped out."
7,14,SAM:,"Well, whatever it is, at least we know where it is."
7,14,DEAN:,Plucky's!
7,14,SAM:,That's where the victims are getting picked up.
7,14,DEAN:,"Yeah, but we swept the place last night, and nada."
7,14,SAM:,"I can go back. Go to the employees, maybe dig up some dirt."
7,14,DEAN:,"What good's that gonna do? They think you're a Fed. The one guy who was gonna rat, he got Bruce'd. If anybody knows anything, they're not gonna tell you."
7,14,SAM:,"All right. 
SAM claps his hands once."
7,14,SAM:,Yep. That's the plan.
7,14,SAM:,"I'll go back, play bad cop, really lean into them."
7,14,DEAN:,And...?
7,14,SAM:,"And... when I'm done, then you watch them."
7,14,DEAN:,"So if somebody freaks out, then that's our creep."
7,14,SAM:,"Or he'll lead us closer, and you can track him."
7,14,DEAN:,"Well, what's my cover?"
7,14,SAM:,I don't know. Just hang back. Act normal.
7,14,DEAN:,"Yeah, yeah. Guy in his thirties hanging out at Plucky's alone – that's normal. That's not pervy at all."
7,14,JEAN:,"So, it doesn't matter what people say. We've roped it off. I've notified the powers that be. Everyone's aware."
7,14,JEAN:,Just no one goes in the...
7,14,SAM:,Hi.
7,14,JEAN:,Agent. I bet I know why you're here.
7,14,SAM:,How's business?
7,14,JEAN:,Turns out not even grim flippin' death can slow down the birthday fun.
7,14,SAM:,Oh.
7,14,JEAN:,"We roped off the ball pit, though, until corporate can get here. I just can't believe the machine fritzed and did Saul in like that."
7,14,SAM:,"Yeah, that makes two of us. I'm gonna need to talk to some of your employees."
7,14,JEAN:,Like who?
7,14,HOWARD:,"Howdy, friend."
7,14,DEAN:,Giant slinky. Would have killed for one of those when I was a kid. How much?
7,14,HOWARD:,"1,000 tickets."
7,14,DEAN:,American dinero. How much?
7,14,HOWARD:,"Oh, we don't take cash here at Plucky Pennywhistle's. Only tickets won through hard work and determination."
7,14,DEAN:,"You mainlined the kool-aid, huh?"
7,14,HOWARD:,It's double-ticket Tuesday if you play skeeball.
7,14,HOWARD:,"Howdy, friend!"
7,14,SAM:,"So, where were you last night?"
7,14,JEAN:,"Well, here. Obviously. I found him. But I was by the cash register the whole time. There's a security camera pointed right at the counter. The cops already looked at it."
7,14,SAM:,Uh-huh. And you heard nothing?
7,14,SAM:,"Yeah, right, right. So that's your excuse."
7,14,SAM:,What? How new?
7,14,JEAN:,Couple weeks. I just got promoted.
7,14,SAM:,"Hmm. So, uh, was there a lot of competition for the gig?"
7,14,JEAN:,"I guess. It comes with benefits. The bosses had us all write essays about how we would do our best for the kids, and they picked me. Don't be shocked, but I actually did two semesters at college, so... I'm not in any kind of trouble, am I?"
7,14,SAM:,I don't know. Why don't you tell me?
7,14,SAM:,Sure you wouldn't.
7,14,SAM:,Quiet.
7,14,TYLER:,Hey! Stop cheating!
7,14,DEAN:,You heard him. Knock it off!
7,14,LIBBY:,"Tyler, soup's on."
7,14,TYLER:,"But, Mom, I don't want –"
7,14,LIBBY:,Just eat it.
7,14,TYLER:,But it sucks!
7,14,DEAN:,"Hey, why don't you cut her some slack?"
7,14,TYLER:,What do you care?
7,14,DEAN:,Because I've been where you are.
7,14,TYLER:,Your mom made you camp at a stupid Plucky's after school?
7,14,DEAN:,"Y–  no. No, but my dad, he... hauled me places. Besides, she's working a tough gig."
7,14,DEAN:,"You know? She's exhausted. You should take pity on the old. And, hey, free grub."
7,14,TYLER:,That stuff tastes like butt.
7,14,DEAN:,"What? Come on, it can't be that bad."
7,14,DEAN:,Let's see here.
7,14,DEAN:,[with an “it’s not so bad” expression] Ah...
7,14,DEAN:,You scared of robots?
7,14,TYLER:,They have laser eyes.
7,14,DEAN:,Yes.
7,14,CHILD:,Excuse me.
7,14,HOWARD:,"Howdy, friend! What's your name?"
7,14,CHILD:,Evan.
7,14,HOWARD:,Hi.
7,14,SAM:,Lose the head.
7,14,SAM:,Why'd you do it?
7,14,YOUNG MAN:,Do... what?
7,14,SAM:,I think you know.
7,14,YOUNG MAN:,I... I got rights. You can't –
7,14,SAM:,"I'm the federal government, pal. I can do whatever I want."
7,14,YOUNG MAN:,Okay. I'll talk.
7,14,SAM:,Dean!
7,14,DEAN:,Hey! Hey! Come here!
7,14,DEAN:,Hey!
7,14,YOUNG MAN:,"If this is about the meth lab that fireballed up in Butte, it wasn't me. Okay, it was my brother, but, um, we got the same fingerprints, and... Please. This is the best job I ever had."
7,14,DEAN:,"All right, look, uh..."
7,14,YOUNG MAN:,Cliff.
7,14,DEAN:,"Cliff. You're not using kids' nightmares to smoke people, are you, Cliff?"
7,14,CLIFF:,I don't...think so.
7,14,DEAN:,Get up.
7,14,CLIFF:,What's going on?
7,14,DEAN:,"All right, cards up. Yeah, we don't care that you, you know, broke bad or whatever. But there is some seriously weird going on in there."
7,14,CLIFF:,You mean the sub-basement.
7,14,SAM:,This place has a sub-basement?
7,14,CLIFF:,Sure. Door's out back. Easy to miss if you don't know.
7,14,DEAN:,What's in there?
7,14,CLIFF:,Alls I know is... Me and Saul used to come in after hours sometimes and... [laughs] You ever shroom in a ball pit?
7,14,CLIFF:,"Not that I...would, agents. It was Saul. Just Saul. All alone. Anyway... Sometimes we'd hear, like, spooky stuff, through the vents... Coming up from the boiler room."
7,14,LIBBY:,"Okay, kiddo. Let's go."
7,14,TYLER:,But somebody stole it!
7,14,LIBBY:,"[sharply] So, draw another one! Okay? We gotta go."
7,14,TYLER:,Okay. I'm sorry.
7,14,LIBBY:,Thank you.
7,14,TYLER:,That place mat sucked anyway.
7,14,SAM:,Dean. What? What is it?
7,14,DEAN:,"While you were out being Dirty Harry, uh, Tyler's mom got pissy with him, and now his place mat's missing."
7,14,SAM:,"So, what do you think?"
7,14,DEAN:,"I think the bitchy mom plus, uh, sad kid plus place mat with something nuts written on it... equals wacky corpse."
7,14,SAM:,"So you think she's next on the list? All right, I'll tail them just to be safe. You –"
7,14,DEAN:,Check the boiler room. I know.
7,14,SAM:,Right.
7,14,SAM:,"Oh. Oh. Uh, Dean, hey, uh, any idea what he drew?"
7,14,DEAN:,Robot.
7,14,SAM:,Robot?
7,14,DEAN:,"Yeah, about the size of a house. Shoots destructo beams out of its eyes."
7,14,SAM:,At least I'll see it coming.
7,14,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,14,DEAN:,"Now, that's perfectly normal."
7,14,HOWARD:,Drop it.
7,14,HOWARD:,Drop it!
7,14,HOWARD:,Mm-hmm. Now kick it over.
7,14,DEAN:,"Some pretty heavy hoodoo you got here. I gotta say, as far as I know, none of these things, uh, can poop out a Unicorn."
7,14,HOWARD:,"There's power in fear. And when a child draws what he's afraid of, a little of that mojo ends up on the page."
7,14,DEAN:,"So, what, you toss it in the fire, and some bed-wetter's horror show comes to life?"
7,14,HOWARD:,"I got to get something off the parent, too. Something they own. That bit gets tricky."
7,14,DEAN:,"Well, it hasn't seemed to slow you down."
7,14,HOWARD:,I'm just doing what I need to!
7,14,DEAN:,Okay. Okay. I get it. Okay?
7,14,DEAN:,No drawing... No Iron Giant!
7,14,HOWARD:,"Oh, that b-word is still on the list! But not tonight. Bigger fish."
7,14,DEAN:,"What, are you gonna shoot me, Howard? You really want a body on your hands? Blood everywhere?"
7,14,HOWARD:,"I’d shut up! 'Cause I got lots of ways to take care of bullies. Don't you worry. Like that FBI guy. He's your pal, right? I saw you chase Cliff down. Five minutes ago, his business card was torched. Along with something from my... personal collection."
7,14,HOWARD:,"I – I – I picked it out real special for him, too."
7,14,HOWARD (V-O):,"Soon as I saw him, I noticed. He was staring at every little Plucky like it was gonna stab him or something."
7,14,HOWARD:,Guy's got a real thing about clowns.
7,14,DEAN:,"Well, hey, these are, uh, really nice dolls. Did you..."
7,14,DEAN:,...paint them yourself?
7,14,DEAN:,"Oh.  Uh, friggin' Plucky."
7,14,HOWARD:,"Plucky helps kids. It's all I ever wanted to do. And when the management slot opened up, I... but they passed me over."
7,14,DEAN:,Shocker.
7,14,HOWARD:,"No, I told them, ""No one cares more than me."""
7,14,HOWARD:,But suits never listen.
7,14,HOWARD:,"So, I'm doing it my way."
7,14,DEAN:,"So let me get this straight. You didn't get the good parking space, so you start dropping bodies?"
7,14,HOWARD:,Those parents were horrible. They deserved what they got.
7,14,DEAN:,What about Saul?
7,14,HOWARD:,Saul had a big mouth!
7,14,DEAN:,"Some guy hits on the babysitter, all of a sudden he's the world's worst dad?"
7,14,HOWARD:,A good parent puts his kids first.
7,14,DEAN:,And having a little girl watch her pop get ganked by the closet monster – that's putting her first?
7,14,HOWARD:,"In the long run, they'll all be better off."
7,14,DEAN:,You think so? Really?
7,14,HOWARD:,I would have been.
7,14,DEAN:,"So, your brother. What happened to him?"
7,14,HOWARD:,It's not my fault! It's theirs!
7,14,DEAN:,Looks to me like he drowned.
7,14,HOWARD:,I was screaming... But my folks... They didn't listen. They never listened.
7,14,DEAN:,It was an accident.
7,14,HOWARD:,They let him die!
7,14,DEAN:,"I'll bet you still have nightmares. In fact, I'll bet you haven't been in the water since."
7,14,HOWARD:,Shut up!
7,14,DEAN:,Because you're afraid.
7,14,HOWARD:,No!!
7,14,HOWARD:,It wasn't my fault.
7,14,HOWARD:,I'm sorry.
7,14,SAM:,Let's roll.
7,14,SAM:,Go ahead. Say it.
7,14,DEAN:,I'm sorry.
7,14,DEAN:,You look like you got attacked by some PCP-crazed strippers.
7,14,SAM:,"Dude, one of them sprayed me with seltzer from his flower."
7,14,DEAN:,I'm s– whew. What?
7,14,SAM:,Nothing. Carry on.
7,14,DEAN:,Ohh. That's... Sam... I'm sorry for... psychologically scarring you.
7,14,SAM:,Which time?
7,14,DEAN:,"Shut up. Seriously. You know, me – me ditching you when we were kids, that was a dick move. You know, the whole clown thing–"
7,14,SAM:,"You know what, man? Honestly... getting my ass kicked by those juggalos tonight was, uh... it was therapeutic."
7,14,DEAN:,You faced your fear.
7,14,SAM:,Exactly. And now what else could a clown possibly ever do to me? I feel good.
7,14,DEAN:,"Well, congrats."
7,14,SAM:,"By the way, to celebrate..."
7,14,DEAN:,What?
7,14,DEAN:,No!
7,14,SAM:,Yes.
7,14,DEAN:,Did you win this?
7,14,SAM:,We earned that.
7,14,DEAN:,Ha ha!
7,14,DEAN:,"Hey. I got you a little something, too, actually."
7,14,DEAN:,What? You said you were over it. You can think of it as a... clown phobia sobriety chip.
7,15,SAM:,"Ms Havelock, you shouldn't have come."
7,15,MS HAVELOCK:,"I needed to see it for myself – after all that tracking, all those hours we spent. I mean, it's one thing to study them in books. It's..."
7,15,POSSESSED MAN:,Do I smell menopause?
7,15,POSSESSED MAN:,"Well, if it isn't the Wiccan bitch of the west. Ms Havelock, I know you're the one that helped them find me."
7,15,MS HAVELOCK:,My God...
7,15,POSSESSED MAN:,"Not in time to save our big girl here, but still, you get a merit badge."
7,15,MS HAVELOCK:,"They caught you, you son of a bitch! No more murders! And you're going back to Hell."
7,15,POSSESSED MAN:,"Oh, Nora, Nora... I'm gonna scoop you out like a pumpkin. You know that?"
7,15,DEAN:,"Yeah, your, uh, scooping days are over, Gomer. All you got to worry about now... is us."
7,15,DEAN:,You ain't the first demon we've tracked down on this safari.
7,15,SAM:,"That's right. As a matter of fact, I think you put us over half a dozen."
7,15,POSSESSED MAN:,Looking for Lilith in all the wrong places.
7,15,DEAN:,"Well, you're gonna help us with that."
7,15,POSSESSED MAN:,"If things are about to get messy, maybe you should meet the owner of this fleshy temple. A puppy of a man. You'll like him."
7,15,SAM:,"Jeffrey? Jeffrey, is that you?"
7,15,JEFFREY:,Oh God. No. You have to stop him.
7,15,SAM:,"We will. We're going to, okay? We're gonna send that demon back to Hell."
7,15,JEFFREY:,Okay. Please don't hurt me.
7,15,SAM:,"Jeffrey, before we can let him go... Look, the demon knows where we can find more of his kind, okay?"
7,15,DEAN:,"See, we're hunting them – all of them. He's not gonna give up his Rolodex easy. Jeffrey, we're gonna have to cut in to him. That means you."
7,15,JEFFREY:,"Oh, the things he made me do to those women. Whatever you have to do... You have to do it. Please just stop this evil piece of..."
7,15,"JEFFREY, POSSESSED:",And on and on and on.
7,15,"JEFFREY, POSSESSED:","Frankly, he can get tedious with this whole ""good and evil"" thing."
7,15,DEAN:,"You know, you were right. I like Jeffrey. He's a decent guy. In fact, he just signed off on his temple."
7,15,"JEFFREY, POSSESSED:",Uh...
7,15,DEAN:,She's got other lieutenants. We already know that.
7,15,SAM:,We want names.
7,15,"JEFFREY, POSSESSED:",All right! All right! His name is Merrick! I swear! You'll find him in New Orleans!
7,15,DEAN:,"Jeffrey? Jeffrey, you awake?"
7,15,DEAN:,"Hey, you passed out. You're in shock."
7,15,JEFFREY:,He's – he's gone?
7,15,DEAN:,"We exorcised him. Try not to move, okay? We're almost to the hospital."
7,15,JEFFREY:,Your... your brother?
7,15,DEAN:,"My brother stayed back to clean us out of that crime scene. There's no reason to go down for a demon's murders, you know what I mean?"
7,15,DEAN:,"All right. All right, take it easy. All right, you're good to make it from here, right?"
7,15,DEAN:,"Okay, Jeffrey, no demon talk in the E.R., you understand me? You were mugged."
7,15,JEFFREY:,Okay.
7,15,DEAN:,Okay.
7,15,JEFFREY:,"All right. Um, uh, thank you."
7,15,DEAN:,"""Classified server""? Got to be Devereaux, right?"
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,It's nice.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,Kind of like a men's room with beds.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"Hmm, avocado grime."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,Takes years to build up a patina like this.
7,15,SAM:,Frank's still stumped on Roman?
7,15,DEAN:,"Yeah. All right, let's do this."
7,15,SAM:,"Okay, um, look at the victim profiles."
7,15,SAM:,"Same age, same hair color, body type. The ritual mutilations line up exactly."
7,15,DEAN:,"Who down there would've let our demon out of the can? He squealed on his superiors. We made sure of that. I mean, he should be down under until, uh, trumpet day."
7,15,SAM:,"But two women killed in the last two weeks, same parts missing, I mean, same old hunting grounds, even."
7,15,DEAN:,"All right, well, we can take a swing at it. But you know it's all about the Leviathans now, okay? They're the ones we need to be hunting."
7,15,SAM:,"Yeah, but, no – I mean, not right now. This one's ours, Dean. It's unfinished business, apparently."
7,15,DEAN:,All right.
7,15,SAM:,Thanks.
7,15,DEAN:,"You know, every time we do this, I wonder if today's the day. We walk up, flash our tin to a bunch of chompers pretending to be policemen."
7,15,SAM:,I hear you.
7,15,DETECTIVE:,"Thought you guys might show up. It's the drummer boys: agents, uh, Bonham... and Watts, right?"
7,15,SAM:,Yeah.
7,15,DEAN:,"Yeah, absolutely."
7,15,SAM:,"Uh, it's a pleasure to see you again, Detective..."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,Sutton.
7,15,SAM:,"You know what? Pardon me. Uh, what was it, Detective..."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,[enunciating clearly] Sutton.
7,15,DETECTIVE:,"Oh, no problemo – Detective Sutton."
7,15,SAM:,Sutton.
7,15,DEAN:,"Sutton, yeah."
7,15,DEAN:,Hi.
7,15,DETECTIVE SUTTON:,"Sad to say, case looks to be open again."
7,15,DEAN:,Are you sure?
7,15,DETECTIVE SUTTON:,Same tools.
7,15,DETECTIVE SUTTON:,Same cuts. Same crazy.
7,15,DETECTIVE SUTTON:,"Makes sense. I mean, we didn't catch the critter last time, did we?"
7,15,DEAN:,And no suspects?
7,15,DETECTIVE SUTTON:,Same as before. Very thorough.
7,15,DETECTIVE SUTTON:,Cold-blooded.
7,15,DEAN:,"Thank you, Detective."
7,15,DETECTIVE SUTTON:,Any time.
7,15,SAM:,Hey.
7,15,SAM:,Sulfur.
7,15,DEAN:,Damn it. Better go check on Havelock.
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,This is it.
7,15,SAM:,Wiccansweb dot com.
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,Internet mail order. White magic only – herbs and talismans.
7,15,SAM:,You sure about that?
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,"Careful, it's still drying. I have a friend at the sheriff's office. I know about all the new murders. I'm doing what I can to protect myself."
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,I'm also translating some very old banishments.
7,15,SAM:,"Wow, uh, these are – these are good."
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,"Thanks. I’ve got an affinity. But back then, that night in that farmhouse, I was in over my head. I know that now, believe me. I will leave all that to the pros."
7,15,DEAN:,"Well, you helped track it down. I mean, it was some solid legwork."
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,"When it came down to it, all I really knew was somebody who knew somebody who knew the right number to call. And your number is not working, by the way."
7,15,SAM:,"Right, we, uh, we've had some technical difficulties – phone issues."
7,15,DEAN:,"It's a monster problem, really."
7,15,SAM:,"So, uh, you haven't had any contact?"
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,"With the demon? No, thank God. I have one or two things to finish in town, and then I'm leaving."
7,15,DEAN:,Good choice.
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,Have you found Jeffrey yet?
7,15,DEAN:,Who?
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,The man who the demon possessed. The one you almost beat to death.
7,15,DEAN:,"Yeah, Jeffrey. That poor bastard."
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,"Some demons tend to be sentimental, don't they? Always go back to the same host if they can."
7,15,SAM:,It's a start.
7,15,MAN 1:,I want to talk about Cinemax. We're grown men. We pay rent. Why can't we get Cinemax?
7,15,MAN 2:,Skinemax.
7,15,FACILITATOR:,"The halfway program advisers have already weighed in on that, Carl."
7,15,FACILITATOR:,Bringing it up in group is not going –
7,15,CARL:,[loudly] I said fine!
7,15,FACILITATOR:,"Jeffrey, you have something pretty big going down later this morning."
7,15,JEFFREY:,"That's right, I guess. Um, I'm picking her up today. I'm getting a dog – a rescue. I had to get her spayed and shots and stuff, but they said she's ready."
7,15,FACILITATOR:,"Jeffrey and I talked about this. He understands that pet ownership is a privilege, not a right. He's gonna have to show the whole house that he can handle the responsibility."
7,15,JEFFREY:,"And that's what it's all about, right, Alan? Handling it."
7,15,WOMAN:,Bye.
7,15,JEFFREY:,"You okay there? Huh? Surgery's a bucket of laughs, huh? You look good. I'm sorry for the cone of shame, but we got to keep these stitches in."
7,15,JEFFREY:,Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on.
7,15,SAM:,Jeffrey?
7,15,DEAN:,Jeffrey?
7,15,SAM:,"Okay. Look, it's okay. You're okay, you're okay."
7,15,DEAN:,Sorry. Just had to make sure.
7,15,JEFFREY:,Make sure of what – that I peed my pants today?
7,15,JEFFREY:,"Aw, you scared my dog."
7,15,SAM:,"Uh, we did not want to do that."
7,15,DEAN:,"Listen, Jeff, we got to, uh, we got to talk."
7,15,DEAN:,"Well, this is, uh..."
7,15,JEFFREY:,I know what it is.
7,15,SAM:,"Look, I know it must've been, um, hard."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,Do you even listen to yourself?
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"Oh, don't bother."
7,15,JEFFREY:,What do you guys want from me?
7,15,DEAN:,"Well, um, we're pretty sure the demon that possessed you... is back."
7,15,JEFFREY:,"What? What do you mean? You exorcised him, right? He's..."
7,15,JEFFREY:,...he's supposed to be in Hell.
7,15,SAM:,"Jeffrey, look, please just calm down. Just have a seat, please."
7,15,JEFFREY:,I don't understand.
7,15,DEAN:,Three more women have been murdered over the past two weeks.
7,15,JEFFREY:,"No, no."
7,15,DEAN:,"Same vic profiles, same forensics, crime scene dusted with sulfur. We've got to assume that it's him."
7,15,SAM:,"But we're here now, okay? So if he comes after you, we'll nail him just like we did last time."
7,15,JEFFREY:,What was her name?
7,15,DEAN:,What?
7,15,JEFFREY:,The last one he killed.
7,15,DEAN:,"Uh, Anna?"
7,15,SAM:,Anna Paxton.
7,15,JEFFREY:,Marjorie Willis. She's the next one on the list.
7,15,SAM:,List? What list?
7,15,JEFFREY:,"The demon used to recite it all the time, like a grocery list. He burned it in my head – the names of all the women he was gonna kill."
7,15,SAM:,He already had his victims chosen?
7,15,JEFFREY:,And put in a line in an order.
7,15,DEAN:,"Wait. Why? Demons aren't usually into the obsessive serial-killer crap. You know, they're more just kind of all-around evil. Why would he do this?"
7,15,JEFFREY:,He said it was his job.
7,15,ALAN:,"Jeffrey, did your, uh, guests sign in?"
7,15,JEFFREY:,"I'm really sorry, Alan. They're friends of mine from my days back at the Post Office. I didn't know they were coming."
7,15,SAM:,"So, what do you think?"
7,15,DEAN:,I think we really helped mess this poor son of a bitch up. Look at him. He's got a state-assigned dad.
7,15,ALAN:,"Okay, just get them to sign in when they sign out."
7,15,SAM:,"Uh, Jeffrey, look, I'm gonna go, uh, I'm gonna go find Marjorie Willis, keep her on watch, okay?"
7,15,DEAN:,Don't worry. I'm gonna stay here just in case.
7,15,WOMAN:,Excuse me.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,You're right. We just don't read anymore.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"Marjorie Willis. Librarian, indoor gardening enthusiast, our demon's next organ donor."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"Come on, Sam, talk to me. It's been months."
7,15,JEFFREY (V-O):,When you left me at the E.R....
7,15,JEFFREY:,"...I had three smashed fingers, five teeth out, a broken wrist, nose, cheekbone, collarbone. I had to get 160 stitches. [He exhales and smiles.] Mugged. The doctor on duty said it looked like I got caught in the Spanish Inquisition."
7,15,DEAN:,And we're the good guys.
7,15,JEFFREY:,"They patched me up, mostly. But I lost my job, my health insurance. I just started to drink and drift, and I got lost. Had some kind of mental break. And I started to talk... about what happened."
7,15,DEAN:,"Aw, man. Never tell. Never... never."
7,15,JEFFREY:,"I know that now, believe me."
7,15,DEAN:,"So, let me guess. Drunk tank to psych eval to 72-hour forced hold to a nice long stay at an institution of their choice."
7,15,JEFFREY:,Yes.
7,15,DEAN:,It's happened to friends of mine.
7,15,JEFFREY:,"For a long time, I didn't care. The truth was more important than where I was. I was in no shape to cope with the outside world."
7,15,DEAN:,"Well, hey, you got out, you know? Holding it together."
7,15,JEFFREY:,And now the demon is back.
7,15,DEAN:,"Yeah. I'm sorry, man. I mean it – about all of it, you know?"
7,15,JEFFREY:,You saved my life. I owe you for it. I know that. I owe a lot of people for getting even this far. I... crap.
7,15,DEAN:,What?
7,15,JEFFREY:,"If he isn't already circling the next woman, Marjorie, then I-I think I might know where he is. He had this special place where he kept souvenirs where he nested."
7,15,DEAN:,Why didn't you tell us this?
7,15,JEFFREY:,I didn't want to go.
7,15,DEAN:,You don't have to go. We'll handle it.
7,15,JEFFREY:,I do. I have to.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"""Average annual rainfall – Hackberry, Texas""..."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"Come on, Sam, pay attention to me. I'm bored."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,Civil war buff?
7,15,DEAN:,Damn it – no service.
7,15,JEFFREY:,[to the dog in the back seat] Good girl. You stay. Here's some jerky. Stay.
7,15,DEAN:,"Thing's not gonna pee in here, is it?"
7,15,JEFFREY:,"Um, I don't know."
7,15,DEAN:,"So, he'd get you this far, and then he'd shut your lights out, yeah?"
7,15,JEFFREY:,"For some reason, he was very secretive about this place. But after a while, he'd only really sort of cover my eyes when we walked in."
7,15,DEAN:,"Okay, you think you can get us back there?"
7,15,WOMAN’S VOICE:,Oh! Oh!
7,15,MARJORIE WILLIS:,"Right here in my discontinued periodicals. Oh. Oh, that's it."
7,15,JEFFREY:,Red door down the hallway.
7,15,DEAN:,"Yeah, there is."
7,15,JEFFREY:,This must be it.
7,15,DEAN:,"All right, stay over here. Okay? You just stay here. Don't move."
7,15,DEAN:,What the hell?
7,15,DEAN:,Hey.
7,15,DEAN:,"Hey. Hey, all right."
7,15,DEAN:,We're gonna get you out of here.
7,15,DEAN:,"Hey, hey, I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? But you got to stay still."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,I'm pretty sure this guy's the boring sort of chubby chaser.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,Not a good sign.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,Hmm. Surprised you haven't picked up on that yet. It's right... there in the coroner's report.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"Yeah. Uh-huh. In this latest round of killings, our big girls had traces of heavy tranquilizers in their blood. Yeah? But our demon's strong enough to make fat Betty do whatever he wants to, right? So, why does he need the tranqs? Think he's got a bad back? Yeah, whatever is going on here, you know that demon's not coming back to kill anybody."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"Oh, no. That's every cellphone Dean's got. One of them should've picked up, right? Big brother's probably dead."
7,15,SAM:,Shut up.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"He said ""shut up"" to me."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"That's what I'm talking about, Sam – real interaction again. I miss that. The rapier wit, the wittier rape. Come on. I'll be good."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,I'll even help you solve your little Nancy Drew mystery or whatever.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,No note.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"Hmm, a cell phone scrambler. But, Luci, those are illegal. Think, Sam. Maybe this has something to do with Dean's telephone blackout."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,Hmm. Latin – not suspicious at all.
7,15,SAM (V-O):,I've never seen this spell before.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,No. But you've seen this type.
7,15,SAM:,A demon summoning – why?
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"Why? To summon a demon, jackass. Start looking at who."
7,15,SAM:,"Okay, what do you mean?"
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,Look at the page.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,You know this handwriting.
7,15,SAM:,I know this handwriting.
7,15,SAM:,"Nora, stop it! Calm down!"
7,15,SAM:,What is this? What is this? Why did Jeffrey have a demon summoning in your handwriting?
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,"Everything's happening the way he said, the way he planned it."
7,15,SAM:,What plan?!
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,You can't help – you can't change it.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,Hit her.
7,15,SAM:,"Nora, tell me what is going on."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"Sam, shake her up. She knows what happened to Dean. Get this stupid cow to focus, will you?"
7,15,SAM:,"Nora, listen to me! Whatever it is, you should be a lot more scared of me right now because I'm two inches away from you, and I can make you talk. Do you understand me?"
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,It's my son. He has my son!
7,15,SAM:,"What were you thinking? I mean, why would you even help bring back a demon in the first place?"
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,Not the demon. Jeffrey!
7,15,SAM:,Jeffrey?
7,15,DEAN:,Jeffrey?
7,15,JEFFREY:,Good. You're up.
7,15,DEAN:,What happened? What's going on?
7,15,JEFFREY:,"No one asked you to get involved, to save me, to save anyone."
7,15,DEAN:,What?
7,15,JEFFREY:,Did you ever think that maybe I loved being possessed?
7,15,JEFFREY:,"Did you? I loved the connection, the power. And I loved him. Love of my life, actually."
7,15,DEAN:,"Oh, you got to be kidding me."
7,15,JEFFREY:,He liberated me.
7,15,JEFFREY:,Started me on my true life mission.
7,15,DEAN:,"So you're the one with the thing for all those women. Aren't you, Jeffrey? You're a serial killer."
7,15,JEFFREY:,I was nothing before he found me – a shadow too scared to do what I was brought here to do. Too timid to live up to my true potential.
7,15,DEAN:,"So, what happened – redheaded mommy make you stuff birds, put on dresses?"
7,15,JEFFREY:,You shouldn't trivialize other people's pain.
7,15,DEAN:,"So, demon comes along, rides co-pilot in your skull... Teaches you how to kill. The list... that's yours."
7,15,JEFFREY:,"For years, it was just a game I would play. Every time I'd walk by one of them in the street or see one on my mail route... There's a sound that comes from their brains. You know that? Only I can hear it, like an evil, little steam whistle. Every time I saw one, I'd follow her, take down her address."
7,15,JEFFREY:,"But I was never gonna do anything, not till he came along. He's the one who saved me. And you sent him to Hell."
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,"I kept tabs on Jeffrey after the exorcism. I even sent him care packages in the hospital, but he never responded. And then not long ago, he came to me."
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,"He seemed healthy, put together, except he wanted to know if there was a way to summon the demon back. He said he'd been doing some research. It was mostly nonsense, but he was convinced it was possible."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,You really knocked the cork out of her piehole.
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,I sent him away. I told him to get some more help. The next day he called me. He put my son on the phone. He had taken him from his dorm room.
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,"I gave him everything – the ritual, the sigils. But he kept my boy."
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,And then he sent me this.
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,My baby's ear. He cut it off because the ritual didn't work.
7,15,SAM:,Well... that demon gave up some serious state secrets – would've gone into big lockdown in Hell. Not so easy to bring him back up.
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,"Jeffrey didn't care. He told me to find out what went wrong or else. Finally, I found a summoning spell that would work for sure."
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,And that's when he said I had another job to do.
7,15,SAM:,Which was what?
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,"When you came, I was supposed to send you to Jeffrey. He left a trail of bodies to make sure of it."
7,15,SAM:,"""Blood of the exorcist""?"
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,Strongest summoning I've ever seen. Requires the blood of the exorcist who banished him – your brother. You see? It is all part of Jeffrey's plan.
7,15,SAM:,Yeah. Well... New plan.
7,15,SAM:,"Tracking spell – Bavarian, Egyptian. I don't care – dealer's choice. Use the flesh of the body to find the body and Dean. Do you want the ear or the kid?"
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,You're giving me the chills.
7,15,JEFFREY:,I like to think I know you pretty well.
7,15,DEAN:,"Yeah, how do you figure?"
7,15,JEFFREY:,"I watched you torture an innocent man to get out a demon. Pretty charged situation... revealing. You guys talked about a lot, showed a lot of character. God... you were so desperate to fix the world back then. It kills you..."
7,15,JEFFREY:,...that people keep getting hurt... and you just can't stop it. Or I should say...
7,15,JEFFREY:,"...it's killed you, shouldn't I?"
7,15,DEAN:,You know what? Screw you.
7,15,JEFFREY:,"Hey. I was there. I was depressed, Dean, because he was gone."
7,15,JEFFREY:,"I was a wreck, an emotional shell, a drunk. I was suicidal."
7,15,DEAN:,"I don't usually endorse suicide, but, man, what stopped you?"
7,15,JEFFREY:,It was Alan
7,15,JEFFREY:,At the house.
7,15,DEAN:,You're kidding me.
7,15,JEFFREY:,He's a really good rehab therapist. Really helped me focus on my goals...
7,15,JEFFREY:,"...my attitude. I have to say, I really benefited from the whole program."
7,15,DEAN:,Yeah.
7,15,JEFFREY:,A life well-lived comes from the structured pursuit of meaningful happiness.
7,15,JEFFREY:,I realized I was nothing without my demon. Then I decided I have to get him back. [pause] I'll be right back.
7,15,DEAN:,No.
7,15,DEAN:,"Oh, you sick son of a bitch."
7,15,DEMON:,"Hello, Jeffrey."
7,15,DEMON:,Dean Winchester. As I live and breathe...
7,15,DEMON:,Again.
7,15,JEFFREY:,Wh – wh–
7,15,JEFFREY:,Oh! What are you doing?
7,15,DEMON:,"I'm thanking you, Jeffrey."
7,15,JEFFREY:,What are you doing with this half-dead piece of crap? Come into me.
7,15,DEMON:,"We had a very special time together, didn't we, Jeffrey? It warms my heart to see you haven't forgotten what I taught you. You built on it."
7,15,DEMON:,"You captured a Winchester. You, Jeffrey... my pupil."
7,15,JEFFREY:,I don't want to be your pupil. I want to be yours.
7,15,DEMON:,"But I'm done with you. My work is finished. You can do everything now, all on your beautiful own."
7,15,JEFFREY:,No.
7,15,DEMON:,No?
7,15,DEMON:,"We don't do ""no."" Remember, Jeffrey?"
7,15,DEMON:,"Keep sawing away at your ropes, Penelope Pitstop. We can dance standing up if you want."
7,15,DEAN:,"So, is this what you do – find postal workers, make 'em go postal?"
7,15,DEMON:,"I talent scout. That's all. Looking for the next generation of superstars... Before they get to Hell, like Jeffrey here."
7,15,DEMON:,"He had all the raw material... just bubbling in there. All I had to do was loosen the lid on his jar, show him some practical know-how."
7,15,DEAN:,"Yeah, what about the kid?"
7,15,DEMON:,This one? I don't think. Not much to work with. No natural gift. I'll probably burn this meat off on my way to Vegas.
7,15,DEMON:,You've got to be kidding me!
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,You let go of my son!
7,15,DEMON:,Where do you keep coming from?
7,15,DEMON:,"[laughs] He'll be back, you know. Back in black."
7,15,DEAN:,Go to hell.
7,15,NORA HAVELOCK:,"I got you. I got you, baby."
7,15,DEAN:,God. Oh.
7,15,SAM:,"So, Jeffrey was just pretending to be the victim. Way back in that farmhouse during the exorcism..."
7,15,SAM:,...h-he was just... acting.
7,15,DEAN:,"He was a psychopath, Sam. That's what they do all the time, is act. Act like they're normal, act like they're not balls-to-the-wall crazy."
7,15,SAM:,You going to sleep?
7,15,DEAN:,Damn straight. Screw consciousness – that's what I say.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"No, no, Sam. No nap for you, Sammy."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"Oh, come on, don't do that."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"Yeah, look at that. Something's definitely different now, isn't it? You let me in. You wanted me, partner. So you think you can use your little tricks to banish me again..."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"...like that? No. I do believe I've got you, bunk buddy."
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,Got my finger wiggling around in your brainpan.
7,15,HALLUCIFER:,"Come on, Sammy! Come on! Say it with me now. [shouts] Good morning, Vietnam!"
7,15,JEFFREY,(strained) I... I... need... some... help.
7,16,GEORGE,I won't be back till 9.
7,18,GIRL,Jenny Greentree. My dad says she really died in the woods. And she's buried in the town cemetery.

8,1,CROWLEY,(sighs) (speaks an incantation in Latin).
8,2,KEVIN,[looking at the Ferrari] Whoa.
8,2,DEAN,Doesn't mean I have to like it.
8,3,CUT TO,POLICE STATION / JAIL INTERVIEW ROOM
8,4,DEAN,Time to hit the books and feed the monster. [He claps a hand to his stomach.]
8,5,SAM,"No, no, no. Dog, dog, dog! Oh..."
8,6,SAM,"Check that out. [He points to the refrigerated cabinet, upon which “Sussex” is written in blood.]"
8,8,FRED,Yeah.
8,8,DR MAHONEY,Good. [He pulls out a gun and cocks it.] Means I can use this.
8,11,GARTH (V-O),Yeah.
8,12,BOY,Where are you going?
8,12,HENRY,"Yours, I presume?"
8,12,HENRY,"She's from Hell. I'm from Normal, Illinois – 1958."
8,12,ABADDON,You still didn't kill me.
8,13,DEAN,Rabbis? Rabbis? [SAM nods.] Really?

8,20,CUT TO,DEAN picking up the newspaper.
8,20,CUT TO,DEAN being approached by the growling creature — which turn out to be two vampire soldiers.
8,23,CROWLEY,"Hmm. Of course. Smart, Moose. Should have seen that."
8,23,DEAN,Take me to him now!
9,1,DEAN,One of yours?
9,6,DEAN,"Reverend Buddy Boyle's ""Goin' For Glory Hour."""
9,6,SAM,"Angels can't possess a human without permission, right?"
9,6,DEAN,Yep.
9,6,SAM,"So, what, they're using this guy to find vessels?"
9,6,DEAN,It's a willing audience.
9,6,ABADDON,Who put Crowley in charge?
9,6,ABADDON,He's a salesman!
9,6,ABADDON,Right now you and I are gonna talk about a regime change.
9,6,CROWLEY,Where do I start to even look for forgiveness?
9,6,SAM,How 'bout we start with this?  (SAM jabs CROWLEY in the neck with a syringe of Sam's purified blood.)
9,6,ANGEL,You're human?
9,6,DEAN,Zeke?
9,6,ZEKE-in-SAM,Castiel cannot stay here.  He will bring the angels down on all of us.
9,6,DEAN,He's warded.
9,6,ZEKE-in-SAM,"He was warded when April found him.  Castiel is in danger.  And if he is here,  I am in danger."
9,6,DEAN,"Wait, you're in danger?"
9,6,ZEKE-in-SAM,"If he stays, I am afraid I will have no choice but to leave."
9,6,JOE,Who are you?  Did the lady from the hotline send you?
9,6,INTRUDER,"No.  (He's wearing a small cross earring in his left ear.)  
You did."
9,6,MAN 1,"I know, and that play in the second quarter?"
9,6,MAN 2,"I mean, what team is he playing for?"
9,6,MAN 1,Not ours.
9,6,MAN 2,High-five!  (The men high-five.)
9,6,DELIVERY MAN,"Morning, Steve (he says briskly to Castiel)"
9,6,CASTIEL,"Bill.  High—  (CASTIEL holds up his hand for a high-five as the delivery man walks past, ignoring it. ) —five.  (CASTIEL closes his hand and lowers it.)"
9,6,WOMAN (NORA),I had to … drop the baby off at daycare—
9,6,NORA,—then hit every red light on the way here.  (She looks around.)  But guess I shouldn't have worried.
9,6,NORA,Place looks great.  Coffee urns?
9,6,CASTIEL,"Uh, full."
9,6,NORA,Dairy case?
9,6,CASTIEL,Stocked.
9,6,NORA,"Okay, Steve, last question – (CASTIEL looks up attentively) – where have you been all my life?  (CASTIEL's mouth works, speechlessly.)"
9,6,NORA,You're not like the other sales associates.
9,6,NORA,There's... something different about you.
9,6,CASTIEL,"I can assure you, there's – there's not."
9,6,NORA,I know these things.  You're ... hmm … special.
9,6,SAM's voice,"That's your ""big … news"", is that you, that you translated the tablet into ... doodles? (disdainfully)"
9,6,KEVIN,"It's cuneiform.  (SAM and DEAN both look at him.)  I-I hit a wall translating the tablet into English. But I found an ancient codex, uh,  linking the Angel script to proto-Elamite cuneiform, and I was able to translate the tablet and the footnotes into Elamite, which … is …"
9,6,DEAN,Doodles.
9,6,KEVIN,It's extinct.
9,6,SAM,"Well, can you read it?"
9,6,KEVIN,No one can.  Scholars have tried for centuries.
9,6,DEAN,So it's a dead end?  (DEAN slaps the papers down on the table in disgust.  SAM puts his sheaf of papers on the table too.)
9,6,KEVIN,"N-not quite. Now, most proto-Elamite is abstract, but I was able to decipher one phrase from Metatron's footnotes. ""Falling angels."""
9,6,SAM,"Okay, so, the footnotes refer to Metatron's spell?"
9,6,KEVIN,Maybe.
9,6,SAM,"Okay.  (Walking to bookshelf.)  Well, maybe if we can decipher the footnotes, then we can reverse the spell and..."
9,6,DEAN,"Punt those winged dicks back to heaven. (DEAN slaps the table, ready for action.)  Where do we start?"
9,6,SAM,"Research.   (SAM tosses one book in front of each of the other two.  DEAN's expression is less than thrilled.)   We comb through the library, see if we can find anything else on Elamite."
9,6,KEVIN,24.
9,6,"KEVIN, reassuringly","Don't worry, we've found them all. (KEVIN looks back down at his own book.)"
9,6,DEAN,"Awesome. (He looks pleadingly over at SAM, who chuffs and looks down at his book.)"
9,6,DEAN mutters,There is a God.
9,6,DEAN,Hello?
9,6,CASTIEL,"Presumed dead, but no bodies have been released to loved ones.  And, there were reports of a strange substance at the scenes."
9,6,DEAN,"Oh, well, hello to you too, Cas.  How are you?"
9,6,CASTIEL,I ... am busy.
9,6,DEAN,"All right. So, how do you want to do this?"
9,6,DEAN,You want to meet up at the latest scene?  You want me to pick you up?  What?
9,6,CASTIEL,Um …  I've got my hands full over here.  I just – um...
9,6,DEAN,Cas? Hello?
9,6,DEAN,"Hey, you sure everything's – (He hears the click and looks at the phone.)  O-kay …"
9,6,SAM,"So, he said nothing about where he is or – or what he's been doing?"
9,6,DEAN,This is Cas.
9,6,DEAN,"In case you forgot, he's not exactly Chatty Cathy."
9,6,SAM (incredulously),And you're not even gonna see him when you're in Idaho?
9,6,DEAN,"Well, like I said, as long as he's catnip for angels, he's keeping his distance."
9,6,SAM,"So then, what's the point, Dean?"
9,6,SAM (continues),"I mean, it's barely even a case."
9,6,KEVIN,"In other words, a perfect excuse to bail out on research."
9,6,DEAN,(brief pause)  You got me.
9,6,NORA,"Hey, Steve?  I found this in the supply closet.  (She holds up a plastic bag with … toothpaste ? in it)  Do you know whose it is?"
9,6,CASTIEL,Um... (comes down from the ladder)  That's mine. Thanks.
9,6,NORA,I also found a rolled-up sleeping bag behind the tool locker.
9,6,CASTIEL,"Yes, (thinking fast) I wanted to be thorough with inventory, so I worked late last week, and taking a nap here was easier than going back home to my bed.  Which I-I have, of course – a bed...and a home."
9,6,NORA,"Wow, Steve.  You're so... responsible."
9,6,NORA,"I've been afraid to ask.  I-I don't want to take advantage  of you as my employee, and I certainly don't want to jeopardize our working relationship. But as a working single mom, it's hard enough to get a date, let alone meet a really great guy.  (CASTIEL looks a little puzzled about where all this is going.) And …  tomorrow's my night off, and I know you're off, too, and … I was just wondering if there's any chance you're... free tomorrow night?"
9,6,CASTIEL,Um... (pause) Yes?  (looks down; happy guitar music starts)   Yes.
9,6,NORA,You're the best!  (She bounces off happily.)
9,6,DEAN,"So, uh, four missing?"
9,6,SHERIFF,Four dead.  Just got confirmation.
9,6,DEAN,"And, uh, any common threads you can think of?"
9,6,SHERIFF,"Well, Joe in there had the suicide hotline on speed dial. The gal before him was a shut-in. Had enough antidepressants in her medicine cabinet to stock a pharmacy. The first victims – a married couple out of Sugar City. Pretty much a walking billboard for no-fault divorce."
9,6,DEAN,Were they all basket cases?
9,6,SHERIFF,"If you asked me to make a list of this county's saddest sacks, these four would've been right on top."
9,6,DEAN,"All right, so, four unhappy people, one of them definitely suicidal. But you've ruled out suicide?"
9,6,SHERIFF,You're gonna want to put these on.
9,6,SHERIFF,This look like suicide to you?
9,6,DEAN,Blood?
9,6,SHERIFF,"If the tests come back same as the others … it's everything. Blood, skin, hair, nails. Internal organs. Even clothing fibers.  Like these poor souls got run through the world's finest wood-chipper."
9,6,DEAN,What about witnesses?
9,6,SHERIFF,"Same as the rest. Neighbors reported some kind of a pink flash. By the time we got here, all that was left was ... this."
9,6,SAM,"Yeah, we're almost through the texts over here. (pause) We got nothing."
9,6,SAM,"Yeah, he's unreachable. He took a sabbatical to live amongst the Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea. Needless to say, we're pretty burnt."
9,6,DEAN,"Well, there's one guy there who is nothing if not well-rested."
9,6,SAM,Crowley?
9,6,DEAN,I'm just saying we're not keeping him chained up for the one-liners.
9,6,SAM,"It's worth a shot, I guess."
9,6,DEAN,"Just be careful, all right? Don't fall for any of his ""quid pro quo"" crap."
9,6,SAM,"Noted.  So, what about you?  How's Cas' lead panning out?"
9,6,DEAN,"No, no, no. I already ruled them out.  The bodies were vaporized. They weren't burned."
9,6,SAM,"That sounds like a real case.  Dean, I should be there."
9,6,DEAN,"Naw, man. That's – That's uh ... not necessary.  No, I, uh – I got this one covered."
9,6,GIRL,"He dumped me, Jace.  (pause)  In the cafeteria. In front of everyone. It's just like ... who does that, you know? Like, why couldn't he just dump me on Facebook like a normal person? (pause) I've been destroyed. Socially and romantically … totaled. (pause) I know. I'm just so embarrassed, Jace. I could just die."
9,6,MURDEROUS INTRUDER,I can help with that.
9,6,GIRL,What?
9,6,DEAN,I'll have some beef jerky and a pack of menthols.
9,6,CASTIEL,What are you doing here?
9,6,DEAN,"Gee, it's nice to see you, too, Cas."
9,6,CASTIEL,"It's … Steve now.  (gesturing towards his employee name tag)  And... uh, you know you surprised me."
9,6,DEAN,"Well, the feeling is mutual. I mean, I knew you had to lay low from the angel threat, but, uh, wow.  This is some cover."
9,6,CASTIEL,"My Grace is gone. What did you expect? Do you have any idea how hard it was? When I fell to earth, I didn't just lose my powers. I – I had nothing. Now... I'm a sales associate (proudly)"
9,6,DEAN,A sales associate?
9,6,DELIVERY GUY,"Hey, Steve. Sign here?"
9,6,CASTIEL,"I'm responsible for inventory, sales, customer service. I keep this place – (he hands the clip board to the delivery guy, who says ""Thank you"" and leaves) – Thank YOU (to the delivery guy) – clean and presentable. And when my manager's busy, I even prepare the food."
9,6,DEAN,Wow. So you went from fighting … heavenly battles to nuking taquitos?
9,6,CASTIEL (nodding),Nachos too.
9,6,SAM,Can you read Elamite or not?
9,6,CROWLEY,"It's by no means my favorite of the ancient tongues, but yes."
9,6,SAM,Will you help us read it?
9,6,CROWLEY,Why on earth would I?
9,6,SAM,"Because I was there that night. I saw what humanity did to you.  (Crowley scoffs very quietly.)  Like it or not, there's still a little part of you that's not a douche."
9,6,CROWLEY,"Sorry, Moose.  To the last drop."
9,6,CROWLEY,Which is?
9,6,SAM (walking),Give you up to Abaddon.
9,6,SAM,"I'm not so sure. Our last encounter with Abaddon, she was, uh – she was pretty terrifying. Scarier than you've been in years.  (SAM laughs.)"
9,6,CROWLEY,Bring that to me.
9,6,DEAN,"This is not you, man.  You are above this. Come on. (CASTIEL has a stubborn expression on his face.)"
9,6,CASTIEL,"No, Dean.  (He puts the box on the counter and turns to face DEAN.)   I'm not. I failed at being an angel. Everything I ever attempted came out wrong. But here …  at least I have a shot at getting things right.  I guess you can't see it, but …  there's a real dignity in what I do – human dignity."
9,6,NORA,"Hate to interrupt you guys, but, Steve?  Customer had an accident in the men's room."
9,6,CASTIEL,I'm on it.
9,6,NORA,"Oh, and tonight – 7:00 at my place work for you?"
9,6,CASTIEL,Great.
9,6,NORA,You're the best!
9,6,DEAN,That's what this is about!
9,6,CASTIEL,What?
9,6,DEAN,The girl.
9,6,DEAN,"Yeah. I mean, my dates usually end when I run out of singles, but, uh, yeah. Yeah, that's something that … humans do."
9,6,CASTIEL,I wouldn't be much use. I don't have my powers.
9,6,DEAN,So?  I've never had powers.
9,6,CASTIEL,You are a hunter.
9,6,DEAN,"And you're a hunter in training, remember?"
9,6,CASTIEL,"Yeah, I remember. You said I sucked."
9,6,DEAN,"I didn't say that. I said that there was, uh, uh, you know, ""room for improvement."" Come on."
9,6,CASTIEL,"All right, my shift's over in five minutes, and my date's not until later, so..."
9,6,DEAN,Attaboy! I'll go get the car.
9,6,CASTIEL,Not just yet.  I have to clean the bathroom? (He pointedly reminds DEAN.)
9,6,JACE,"One second, we're talking, and the next, she just...stops. And then everyone in the cafeteria freaks, rushing, and pointing out the window, at— (she breaks into sobs)  C- could that really be her?"
9,6,DEAN,"And nobody saw anybody else at the scene – a man, a woman ... anything unusual?"
9,6,DEAN,"Your friend, was she, uh, depressed?"
9,6,JACE,Depressed?
9,6,DEAN,Any thoughts of suicide?
9,6,JACE,"Ew. No.  I mean, she was kind of bummed that dick-bag Travis broke up with her in front of the whole school."
9,6,DEAN,'Kind of bummed'?
9,6,DEAN,Excuse me.
9,6,DEAN,"Cas, what's wrong?"
9,6,CASTIEL,I've seen this before.
9,6,DEAN,What? Where?
9,6,CASTIEL,In heaven.
9,6,DEAN,"What, you're saying an angel did this?"
9,6,CASTIEL,"It's no ordinary angel. Dean, this is bad. This is very bad."
9,6,CASTIEL,"On the battlefields of Heaven, there was a special class of angel, the Rit Zien. It's, uh, Enochian for ""Hands of Mercy."" They functioned like medics. They tended to the wounded. They healed those who could be healed, but for the mortally wounded, those who were past saving, the Rit Zien's job was to put them down."
9,6,DEAN,But the granulated bodies?
9,6,CASTIEL,This was their special ability. They had this way of smiting that was so quick and so total that it rendered death virtually painless.
9,6,DEAN,"Yeah, but these aren't wounded angels that they're vaporizing, they're people."
9,6,CASTIEL,"Right. I don't know. The Rit Zien home in on pain, it's like a beacon to them. So, when this angel fell to earth, he heard the victims' cries, and their anguish, same as he'd hear an angel's in heaven. He's continuing his heavenly work down here. One suffering human at a time."
9,6,DEAN,"Yeah, but this last victim was not suffering. She was just a normal, moody kid."
9,6,CASTIEL,"But he just got here.  The ebb and flow of human emotion – Dean, I've been on earth for a few years, and I've only begun to grasp it. To him, pain is pain."
9,6,DEAN,So everybody's fair game?
9,6,DEAN,"All right, well, we got to stop him."
9,6,CASTIEL,You have to stop him.
9,6,DEAN,You're scared.
9,6,CASTIEL,"It's different now, Dean. Everything feels different."
9,6,DEAN,"You're right. All right, I'll track down this, uh, Kevorkian wannabe, and I'll put him down."
9,6,CASTIEL (sighs),Okay.
9,6,DEAN,"You stay safe. Go on that date, all right?  Go live a normal life."
9,6,CASTIEL,Okay.
9,6,DEAN,Well?
9,6,CASTIEL,I need a ride.
9,6,DEAN,Right.
9,6,CROWLEY,I'll do it. But I want something in return.
9,6,SAM,"Yeah, what's that?"
9,6,CROWLEY,A telephone call.
9,6,CROWLEY,"Come on, Moose!  Even Dahmer got one telephone call."
9,6,KEVIN,Seriously?  You want to let Crowley communicate with Abaddon?  A king and a power-mad knight of hell isn't enough for you?  You want to throw a demonic team-up into the mix?
9,6,SAM,"I don't think so.  I mean, I – I don't trust Crowley, either. But I can't honestly see him working with Abaddon. He hates her too much."
9,6,KEVIN,You said it. You can't trust him.
9,6,SAM,"We don't have to. Look, Crowley's bound. Ah, We can end the call whenever we want. Even if he wanted to give Abaddon information, he has none to give her. He doesn't even know where the bunker is."
9,6,KEVIN,He says he can decrypt the translation? What if he's lying?
9,6,SAM,You're right. We're gonna need proof.
9,6,SAM,What are these?
9,6,CROWLEY (teasing),Ingredients.
9,6,SAM,More specific.
9,6,KEVIN,And the rest of them.
9,6,CROWLEY,Phone call. You'll get the rest when I get paid.  Now.  Who's gonna be a dear and open up a vein?
9,6,DEAN,Okay.
9,6,CASTIEL,"Thanks, Dean."
9,6,DEAN,Cas.  Wait.  (DEAN sighs.)   I can't let you do this.
9,6,CAS,What?
9,6,DEAN,"Okay.  Uh, lose the vest."
9,6,CASTIEL,What are you –
9,6,DEAN,"Lose the vest, come on."
9,6,DEAN,That's a little better.  All right.  There we go. All right.
9,6,DEAN,And do the buttons –  why don't you unbutton it?
9,6,DEAN,"Okay. Th- that's far enough, Tony Manero.  (DEAN laughs a little.)  Um... (DEAN gives CASTIEL a once-over.)  Yeah. Good. All right.  Listen to me. Always open the door for her, okay? Ask a lot of questions. They like that. And, uh... Oh, if she says she's happy to go Dutch …  she's lying. All right?"
9,6,DEAN,"Go get 'em, tiger."
9,6,DEAN (watching),Nice touch.
9,6,NORA,Steve!  I'm so glad you're here.  (She smiles welcomingly.)   Come in. I thought I was gonna be late!
9,6,CASTIEL,Late for what?
9,6,NORA (continued),"Wish me luck.  Oh, and thank you.  You really are the best."
9,6,CASTIEL,Babysitting.
9,6,CROWLEY,Not yours. His. (CROWLEY nods his head towards KEVIN.)
9,6,SAM,What difference does it make?
9,6,CROWLEY,"I've had yours.  Stuck in here, you can't fault me for wanting a little variety."
9,6,KEVIN,No way!
9,6,CROWLEY,"What's wrong, Short Round? Afraid of needles?"
9,6,KEVIN,"No, I just have a policy of not giving blood to anyone who's murdered my mother."
9,6,CROWLEY,I … have nothing … but time.
9,6,SAM,You're a dick.  (Packs up the kit.)
9,6,CROWLEY,Good luck with that translation.
9,6,SAM,What? What happened?
9,6,CROWLEY,I've been placed on hold.
9,6,CASTIEL,"Hello?  Um...  Please – please don't.  Um …   Okay.  Oooo-kay, okay.  (Picks up the baby.)   How 'bout – how 'bout a lullaby?   Um...  Okay. Shh. Shh!"
9,6,CASTIEL,"Shhh.  I know, I know."
9,6,DEAN,Sheriff?
9,6,SHERIFF,"Now, here's a wrinkle. Our first crime scene, married couple? Full analysis of the spray came in from the lab. Turns out it only contains the wife's DNA."
9,6,DEAN,The husband's still out there.
9,6,CASTIEL (continued),You're very warm.  Is that normal?
9,6,CASTIEL,"Oh, shh. Shh. Shh. Shh."
9,6,SHERIFF,"He was already a bit screwy, but then he found religion. She was a hard-line atheist, no peach herself, when he got himself obsessed with this Buddy Boyle whack job, an already bad marriage got worse. Kept telling her to ""Let God in."""
9,6,DEAN,Buddy Boyle. That explains it.
9,6,SHERIFF,Explains what?
9,6,DEAN,Never mind.  Let's see.  (looking at photos)   Is that his truck?  (remembering the truck that almost boxed him in at NORA's house)
9,6,SHERIFF,Yep.
9,6,DEAN,Cas ... (realizing the angel is heading for CAS)
9,6,CASTIEL (worried),"Okay, Tanya, we're taking a little walk."
9,6,ANGEL,"Hello, Castiel."
9,6,ANGEL,Squalid little dump.  No wonder she cries.
9,6,CASTIEL,"It's a fever, Ephraim.  It will pass."
9,6,ANGEL (EPHRAIM),"You remember my name?  I was just a nobody when we met, but you – you were a legend. You've been here before. This is my first time, and it's ... intense."
9,6,CASTIEL,"You know, there's a lot you don't understand about humanity at first. If you would just stop—"
9,6,EPHRAIM,Stop? I won't stop …  until I wash the planet clean of all suffering.
9,6,EPHRAIM,Allow me.
9,6,EPHRAIM,"You think I came for her?  No, Castiel.  I came for you."
9,6,SAM,How long's it take to transfer a demonic phone call?
9,6,CROWLEY,"Can it, Moose."
9,6,KEVIN,"Crowley, you got your call."
9,6,SAM,"Yeah, it's time."
9,6,CROWLEY,It's time when I bloody well say it's time!
9,6,ABADDON,"Crowley, how in the hell are you?"
9,6,EPHRAIM,"So much pain and despair, so many voices begging out for relief."
9,6,CASTIEL,How'd you find me?
9,6,EPHRAIM,Because you're warded? The same way I find all my patients – I just followed the sound of your pain. You have no idea how loud it is. I could hear you for miles.
9,6,CASTIEL,Do you really think you're doing Heaven's work down here?
9,6,EPHRAIM,I know I am.
9,6,CASTIEL,"Well, you're wrong. Earth can be a hard place. But these humans, they can get better. They're just doing the best they can."
9,6,EPHRAIM,"Is that what you think you're doing, Castiel – the best you can? Well, I'm sorry. But if this is the best that the famed Castiel can do, you're a more urgent case than I thought. I used to admire you. You failed more often than you succeeded. But at least you played big."
9,6,EPHRAIM,Now what are you doing? Burying your head in the sand. Right when your kind needs you the most.
9,6,CROWLEY,And how are the numbers?
9,6,ABADDON,"You mean souls? I've managed to double on your projections. Now, how did I ever pull off such a feat?"
9,6,CROWLEY,You're taking souls before their time.  Voiding my contracts!
9,6,ABADDON,"That's right. I'm taking it all down, brick by brick. It's over. The days of Crowley, the king of bureaucrats – are done."
9,6,EPHRAIM,Shh-shh-shhh. It'll be over soon. I'll take the pain away.
9,6,CASTIEL,I want to live.
9,6,EPHRAIM,"But as what, Castiel? As an angel?  or a man?"
9,6,CROWLEY,You... ganky... putrescent... skanger.
9,6,CROWLEY (continues),"It may look like bean-counting to you, it may lack a certain adolescent flair, but my way... Works!"
9,6,CROWLEY (continues),"You think you can control Hell with chaos alone, without the support of those who are still loyal to me?!"
9,6,ABADDON,"No one's seen you in weeks, and last I saw you, Howdy and Doody had you tied up nice and tight. Seems to reason, they've turned you into a kennel dog. How does it feel, Crowley, to be the Winchesters' bitch? It's been fun indulging in your bluffs, but we both know you have no real authority left, no leverage.   You have nothing to offer me.  You have – nothing."
9,6,CROWLEY,Your way will backfire.  You.  Will.  Burn.
9,6,ABADDON,I can't wait.
9,6,SAM,Crowley?
9,6,CROWLEY,Bring me the translations.  I keep my agreements.
9,6,CROWLEY reads,"""Obtain the ingredients – heart, bow, Grace."" Blah, blah, blah. ""Mix until the smoke shall rise from the ashes casting the angels  from heaven.""  Blah, blah – Oh.  Hm. It's irreversible."
9,6,SAM,What?
9,6,CROWLEY,This spell can't be undone. The new world order – we're stuck with it.
9,6,EPHRAIM,"You say you want to live.  But you can't see what I see. By choosing a human life, you've already given up.  You … chose … death."
9,6,DEAN,"Well, there's no way. Crowley's lying."
9,6,SAM,"No, Dean, not this time. Look, Metatron built the spell to withstand any attempt to reverse it. There is no putting the angels back in Heaven.  It's done."
9,6,SAM,Are you gonna tell Cas?
9,6,CASTIEL (awkwardly),"I'm, uh, sorry I overreacted.  Um.  My friend gave me a tip. A low dose of acetaminophen brought the fever right down."
9,6,NORA,"Oh, that's okay.  Date was a bust anyway.  (pause; CASTIEL walks down the stairs)   Steve?  (CASTIEL stops and turns to look at her.)  The part of you that overreacted, that cares so much? That's what makes you special."
9,6,DEAN,"Listen, Cas … Back at the bunker, I, uh... Sorry I told you to go.  I know it's been hard on you, you know, on your own.  Well, you're adapting.  I'm proud of you."
9,6,CASTIEL,"Thank you, Dean.  (Sighs) But there's something Ephraim said. The angels – they need help. Can I really sit this out? Shouldn't I be searching for a way to get them home?"
9,6,DEAN,Me and Sam will take care of the angels.  You're human now. It's not your problem anymore.
9,7,SAM,What else do you remember?
9,7,DEAN,"Nothing. I was a kid, all right?"
9,7,JOHN,And most important—
9,7,SAM (voiceover),"I got this brother, right? And he's always telling me how he's gonna watch out for me."
9,7,DEAN (praying),Sammy's hurt.  He's hurt real bad.
9,7,EZEKIEL,I heal Sam while healing myself.
9,7,DEAN,"You went through the trials.  I just think it's better if you took it easy, you know, and didn't act like you were—"
9,7,KID 1,"Go, go, go – it's open!"
9,7,MAN,"All right!   Game is over, boys!  Let's bring it in!  (looking for kids)  Lights out was 10 minutes ago!"
9,7,MAN,Boys?  (pause)  Come on!  This isn't funny.
9,7,SAM,Dean?
9,7,SAM (continues),Kevin?
9,7,SAM,Hello?
9,7,SAM,"I'm sorry, there's no, uh ˜ there's no Dee-dawg, uh..."
9,7,DEAN,"I got it, I got it.  (DEAN takes the phone.)   Sonny, hey.  (pause)  So what's up?   (pause)  Okay.  (pause)  All right. Yeah, just sit tight.  I'll be there as soon as I can.  (pause)  Yeah."
9,7,SAM,"So, what was that all about, 'Dee-dawg'?"
9,7,DEAN (continues),"We, uh – we crashed at the, uh ... the bungalow colony with the ping-pong table?"
9,7,DEAN,"Truth is, uh…"
9,7,DEAN (continues),I lost the food money that Dad left for us in a card game.
9,7,DEAN (continues),"I knew you'd get hungry, so ... I tried taking the five-finger discount at the local market and got busted.  I wasn't on a hunt.  They sent me to a boys' home."
9,7,SAM,"A boys' home, like a … reform school?"
9,7,DEAN,"Yeah, more or less.  It was a farm, and the guy who ran it – Sonny – he, uh, you know, he looked after me."
9,7,SAM,Wait. Does Sonny know what we do?
9,7,DEAN,"Yeah. He's good people.  I gave him the number to the Bat Phone, and sounds like he's got something in our wheelhouse."
9,7,DEAN (continues),"So...  Hey – you gonna be cool to do this, or are you too tired?"
9,7,SAM,"Uh, no. Yeah, I'm just, uh ... I'll be fine."
9,7,DEAN,"Yeah.  Right.  All right.  Grab your stuff,  and we'll head out."
9,7,SAM,"Hey, Dean ... I mean, why didn't you just tell me you went to a boys' home?"
9,7,DEAN,"I don't know. Uh, it was Dad's idea.  And then it just – you know, the story became the story.  I was 16."
9,7,SAM,You were here for two months and Dad couldn't find you?
9,7,DEAN,"Oh, no.  He found me.  He found me quick.  But he left me here 'cause I lost our money."
9,7,SAM,You were 16.  You made a mistake.
9,7,DEAN,Hi.
9,7,RUTH,What can I do for you boys?
9,7,DEAN,"I'm Dean. This is my brother, Sam.  We're old buddies of Sonny's."
9,7,RUTH,Prison buddies?
9,7,DEAN,No.  Uh ... you mind telling him that we're here?
9,7,DEAN,"What, and we're such angels?  Trust me, he's more than made up for it."
9,7,DEPUTY BILLY,Steven Hewlett caught him red-handed stealing up at his store.
9,7,SONNY,So what'd he take?
9,7,DEPUTY BILLY,Get this – peanut butter and bread.
9,7,SONNY,Okay.  And how about family?
9,7,DEPUTY BILLY,"Well, his old man called.  (YOUNG DEAN looks up.)  Once he found out what happened, he said let him rot in jail.   (YOUNG DEAN looks down at his knees.)  Judge is off on a fishing trip.  Boy's too young to leave in County.  So we thought it best he stay here till arraignment."
9,7,SONNY,"I don't see why not, man."
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,I think you're slow.
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,You wish!
9,7,SONNY,"You shouldn't do that, kid."
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,Yeah? Why? Because he's a cop?
9,7,SONNY,"Because when you make him mad, he leaves with the key."
9,7,SONNY,"Eh, don't sweat it."
9,7,SONNY,Okay.
9,7,DEAN,"So, how do you know I won't just run away?"
9,7,SONNY,Because you're hungry.
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,"No, I'm not."
9,7,SONNY,"Well, then, why'd you steal bread and peanut butter?"
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,"So, what is this place, anyway?"
9,7,SONNY,It's for boys like you.  You work the land.  Teaches you some discipline and responsibility.  Keep you out of trouble.
9,7,SONNY,Beats jail.  Come on.  I'll fix you something to eat.
9,7,SONNY,Dee-dawg!
9,7,DEAN,Sonny! Good to see you.
9,7,SONNY,"Hey, you, too, brother.  (They hug. SAM stands by watching.)  Oh, and this must be Sam."
9,7,SAM,Good to meet you.
9,7,SONNY,"Back at you, brother."
9,7,DEAN,"So, farm looks, uh, nice."
9,7,SONNY,"Oh, please, man.  It's barely standing.  Only got a handful of kids working around here now."
9,7,DEAN,Why's that?
9,7,SONNY,"Because these days, the system would rather incarcerate a boy than redeem him."
9,7,SAM,"Hey, Sonny, uh, you – you mind if we talk alone?"
9,7,DEAN,"All right. So, what's happening?"
9,7,SONNY,"Well, you remember Jack, don't you?"
9,7,DEAN,"Yeah. The, uh, tough, old leatherneck."
9,7,SONNY,"Mm-hmm.  Well, somehow, that ancient, rusty, broken-down tractor just roared to life and ran him over the other night."
9,7,SAM,"Maybe – maybe it just, uh, slipped out of park or something."
9,7,SONNY,"Couldn't have.  (Shakes his head.)   You know, I never – I never believed any of this mumbo-jumbo stuff you boys are into, but... something ain't right."
9,7,SAM,What do you mean?
9,7,SONNY,"Well, just … things started happening – you know, lights flickering on and off, strange scratching sounds coming from inside the walls, windows and doors slamming."
9,7,DEAN,All right.  You think you can round up the boys while we take a look around?
9,7,SONNY,"Well, that shouldn't be a problem.  Most are home on break – well, except those with no home worth going to."
9,7,DEAN,Mm.
9,7,SAM,Yeah.
9,7,SAM,"Hey. I am so sorry.  I-I-I thought I ... saw something in, uh –"
9,7,RUTH,"Like a ghost?  (She sounds more human and pleasant for the first time, and looks at the window.)"
9,7,RUTH,"Sonny told me you were old friends, but … I know why you're really here.  That's why I was praying for us."
9,7,SAM,Praying for what?
9,7,DEAN,"All right, Casper... Where're you at?"
9,7,DEAN,"Hey, kid, what are you doing in here by yourself?"
9,7,Kid,Fighting monsters.
9,7,DEAN,What kind of monsters?
9,7,KID,"All sorts, with Bruce the monster smasher.  (The KID holds up his action figure doll.)"
9,7,DEAN,"Hm.  Is that a cape?  Little impractical for smashing monsters, huh?   You know, you could choke—"
9,7,KID,Timmy.  (shakes hand)
9,7,DEAN,"Let's try that again.  If you're gonna be a man, you got to learn how to shake like one, okay?  So give me your best Kung Fu grip.  Good.  (They shake again.)  Now look me straight in the eye.  Let me know  that you mean business.  Shake as hard as you can.  (Shake again.)  That's it.  You shake like that, you'll be all right.   (TIMMY smiles.)  Hey, Timmy, did you know Jack who worked here?"
9,7,TIMMY nods,"MM-hmmm (he says, very quietly)"
9,7,DEAN,What can you tell me about him?
9,7,TIMMY,He yelled a lot.  He was yelling when he had his accident.
9,7,DEAN,How do you know that?
9,7,TIMMY,'Cause me and the other boys were playing here when it happened.
9,7,DEAN,"Did you see anything?  (TIMMY shakes his head no.)   Is there anything else about that night that you can remember, anything at all?"
9,7,TIMMY,It suddenly … got really cold.  (DEAN looks thoughtful.)  Can I go?  I have to finish my chores before Miss Ruth gets mad.
9,7,DEAN,"That Ruth –  she runs a tight ship, huh?  Yeah, you better roll."
9,7,SAM,He killed her?
9,7,RUTH,"With a meat cleaver.   Got life in jail.  Which for Howard ended a year ago.  He always swore he'd get his revenge on poor old Jack, and ... looks like he finally got it."
9,7,SAM,Is Howard buried here in town?
9,7,SAM,So …  Dad didn't want you to tell me.  How come?  Was this place really so bad?
9,7,DEAN,"I don't really remember.  I mean, look, nobody bad touched me.  Nobody burned me with their smokes, or beat me with a metal hanger.  I call that a win."
9,7,DEAN:,Hey.
9,7,DEAN (sighs),"All right. Let's barbecue old MacDonald here, get the hell out of Dodge."
9,7,RUTH,Help! Help!
9,7,SONNY,"Ruth, you okay?  What's wrong?"
9,7,SONNY,Open up!
9,7,SONNY,Ruth!
9,7,SAM,"Dean, you know I'm fine just grabbing a burger-to-go somewhere, right?"
9,7,DEAN,"What, and miss out on the best banana pancakes you ever had?"
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,Thanks.
9,7,SONNY,No prob.  I do this for all the boys after they've been here for a month.
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,I meant for getting the charges against me dropped.
9,7,SONNY,"Well, being hungry's not a crime.  It's the stealing that is.  But I feel if you only do that once, you don't deserve a record.  And seeing as how we can't find your pops anywhere, you can stay here as long as you want, Dean.  You're doing good in school.  You're making friends.  You made the wrestling team.  I'm proud of you.  (pause)  Let me ask you something, and I want you to be straight with me.  Are you into the whole heavy-metal, devil-worshiping stuff?"
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,What?   No.
9,7,SONNY,"Hey, I'm not –  I'm not judging.  It's just I found a few occult-looking symbols carved into your bedpost."
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,(sighs)  It's a very long story.
9,7,SONNY,That story have anything to do with why you put the salt in front of your bunk door every night before bed?
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,"Well, it's a family thing, so I can't really talk about it."
9,7,SONNY,Same family that left you here?
9,7,SONNY (continues),"(laughs)
What are you – what are you, in the mob or something?"
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,More like something.  (looks back down at his menu)
9,7,SONNY,"I was part of this gang, right?  They were my family.  I lived, breathed, I would have even died for them.  You know where it got me?  15 years in a correctional facility.  And for what? Being loyal?  To who?  I should have been loyal to myself. Because you get one shot at this game, Dean, and when you look in the mirror, you want the guy looking back at you to be his own man."
9,7,YOUNG ROBIN,"Hey, guys."
9,7,SONNY,"Hey, Robin.  How are you?"
9,7,YOUNG ROBIN,I'm good. How are you?
9,7,SONNY,"Good.  Meet my new ranch foreman here, Dean."
9,7,ROBIN,Hi. Welcome to Cus's.  What can I get you two?
9,7,DEAN,"Bet you never thought you'd see me here, huh?  (He smiles insinuatingly.)"
9,7,ROBIN,"Uh,  look, I'm a little bit slammed right now.  Do you guys want to hear the specials?"
9,7,ROBIN,Um ...
9,7,DEAN,I used to live up at Sonny's.
9,7,ROBIN,"Oh, oh.  Uh, look, sorry.  There's just – there's so many boys that pass through there, it's – it's hard to remember every – every name and face."
9,7,DEAN,"Yeah. Uh, no.  Sorry, I just – I remember you coming up there  with your mom.  She'd give guitar lessons.  It's, uh – it was a long time ago."
9,7,ROBIN,Yeah. Mom – she loved helping out the boys.  I guess that's why I kept giving lessons after she passed.
9,7,ANOTHER WOMAN,"Hey, Robin?"
9,7,ROBIN,"Um, would you excuse me?  I'll be right back."
9,7,SAM,Dude …?
9,7,SAM,Wh – what was that?
9,7,DEAN,Nothing.
9,7,SAM,"Nothing? Well, obviously it was something.  Who was that waitress?"
9,7,DEAN,"I said it was nothing, all right?  Drop it."
9,7,DEAN,Sonny.  (pause)  What?!
9,7,SONNY,"I tried to get in to save her, but the damn door wouldn't open."
9,7,SAM,Locked?
9,7,SONNY,There's no locks on the farm.
9,7,SONNY,"What, 'cause we're not chest-deep in weird already, boys?"
9,7,DEAN,"I know, I know.  I mean anything – really."
9,7,SONNY,"There was one thing.  Ruth always had her rosary beads with her, but now I can't find them anywhere."
9,7,SAM,"All right. Um, let's start with the vics, okay?  I mean, both lived in the house.   They both, uh, worked closely with the boys."
9,7,DEAN,"All right, why don't I go have a chat with the rug rats, see what's up?  (Dean walks off)"
9,7,SAM,"Yeah.  Sonny, you got any employee records on the victims?"
9,7,SONNY,In my office.  Let's do it.
9,7,KID 1,"Come on, whatcha gonna do about it? You gonna cry?"
9,7,KID 2,"Timmy, you're such a little weirdo."
9,7,KID 2,Nothing.
9,7,DEAN,"Timmy, what's going on?"
9,7,DEAN,"All right, you two.  Where were you this morning when Ruth had her accident?"
9,7,KID 1,"Unless you're a cop, we don't need to tell you anything."
9,7,DEAN,"Oh, okay.  Well ..."
9,7,KID 1,We weren't even here this morning.  Sonny sent us into town to get some chicken feed – we swear.
9,7,DEAN,What about Ruth?  What can you tell me about her?
9,7,KID 2,"Uh, we used to call her the warden.  She was a real Bible-thumping hard-ass."
9,7,DEAN,Obviously. What else?  Anything different or weird you can think of?
9,7,KID 1,You mean besides Timmy?
9,7,DEAN,"Hey!  (lower voice:)  Either of you touch him ever again, I'm gonna go all Guantánamo on you.  (KID 2 swallows.)  Understand me?  You get the hell out of here.  Go on! Get."
9,7,DEAN,Hey.  You and Bruce okay?
9,7,TIMMY,Yeah.
9,7,DEAN,"Listen to me.  Guys like that – they're cowards, okay?  All you got to do is stand up to them one time and they'll stop, I promise."
9,7,SAM,"Hey Sonny, wait.  Um ...  W-what is all this?"
9,7,SONNY,"It's our hall of fame.  We had some pretty great athletes come through here, including your brother.  (SAM exhales.)  He was Sullivan county 135-pound wrestling champion.  (SAM exhales again.)"
9,7,ROBIN,"Hey, guys!"
9,7,KID 2,She could give me a lesson anytime.
9,7,KID 1,Gross.  She's like ancient.
9,7,KID 2,What the hell?
9,7,KID 2,What's this doing in here?
9,7,DEAN,"Kid's gonna need about 8,000 stitches, but he'll be fine."
9,7,SAM,"That kid was bullying Timmy before the accident, right?"
9,7,DEAN,Yeah. Why?
9,7,SAM,Check this out.  (handing DEAN the file)  Timmy was found in an abandoned building about a year ago all by himself.  No one was sure how long he had been there.
9,7,DEAN,And what about his parents?  (tosses file back to SAM)
9,7,SAM,"Well, they posted a picture on the Internet, but no one ever showed up."
9,7,DEAN,"Well, then, what's he doing here?  Shouldn't he be in an orphanage?"
9,7,SAM,"He kept running away from Child Services.  So about three months ago, Sonny offered to take him in."
9,7,DEAN,"All right, so hard-ass counselors, bullies, all bite the dust, but Timmy's still standing.  So, what are we talking?  We got ourselves a Damien on our hands?"
9,7,SAM,No.  EMF rules out a demon.  So ...  probably ghost possession.
9,7,DEAN,"Meaning what, we find Timmy and shove a fistful of salt down his throat, forced ejection?"
9,7,YOUNG ROBIN,"So, you've been a lot of places?"
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,"Yeah. My, uh …  My dad likes to move around a lot."
9,7,YOUNG ROBIN,What's your dad do?
9,7,YOUNG ROBIN,Do you like it?
9,7,YOUNG ROBIN,"Yeah. I - I get it. My pops wants me to take over the diner?  But that's not happening.  So, what do you really want to do?"
9,7,YOUNG ROBIN,Being a mechanic seems rough.
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,"What?  No, no. Not at all.  Cars are freaking cool as hell.  Fixing them is like … a puzzle, and the best part is when you're done, they leave, and you're not responsible for them anymore."
9,7,YOUNG ROBIN,Have you kissed many girls?
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,What?  (whew)  Yeah. Of course.  Lots.
9,7,YOUNG ROBIN,"Really?  (she grabs his collar)  Well, I guess we'll just have to keep practicing."
9,7,ROBIN,"Oh. Hey.  Uh, what happened to you at the diner?  I turned around to take your order, and you were just … gone."
9,7,DEAN,"Long story.  Um, have you seen Timmy?"
9,7,ROBIN,"No, not yet, but he should be here any minute for his guitar lesson."
9,7,DEAN,"Yeah, we're gonna cancel that."
9,7,ROBIN,What?
9,7,DEAN,"We got to get out of here, okay?  I don't have time to explain.  You just got to trust me."
9,7,ROBIN,T-trust you?  (scoffs)  (sighs)  And why would I do that again?
9,7,ROBIN (softly),How could I forget?
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,What's wrong?
9,7,YOUNG ROBIN,I just hope this lasts.
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,"I'm not going anywhere, Robin."
9,7,YOUNG ROBIN,"Yeah, says you."
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,"Well, I can't."
9,7,YOUNG ROBIN,"Is this your way of asking me to be your date, Dean Winchester?"
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,Yeah.  How am I doing so far?
9,7,DEAN,There were – there were reasons why I had to leave.  I don't have time to explain them to you right now.  I got to get you out of here.
9,7,ROBIN,Hey!   What are you doing?!
9,7,TIMMY,I'm sorry.
9,7,DEAN,"Sorry about what, Timmy?"
9,7,TIMMY,I can't stop it.
9,7,DEAN,"Go, go, go!"
9,7,DEAN,"Sam, go!"
9,7,DEAN,Locked.  Damn it!
9,7,DEAN,Circle.
9,7,ROBIN,"Dean, what – what just happened in there?"
9,7,DEAN,"Okay, listen to me.  Whatever happens, you stay inside this circle.  Understood?"
9,7,SAM,All right. Dean (warningly) ...
9,7,TIMMY,I can't control her.
9,7,DEAN,Can't control who?
9,7,SAM (continues),"Timmy, listen.  We need you to tell us about the fire, okay?"
9,7,TIMMY,"It was late, and we were driving home when we crashed in the woods. Everything was on fire.  But she saved me, pushed me out...  (in the memory we can hear her cries)   Before the car blew up... with her in it."
9,7,SAM,"But that's not all, was it?"
9,7,TIMMY,"I ran through the woods.  I found an empty building, where I hid.  I was scared. It was dark and cold.  So I cried.  I cried for my mom.  And then she came."
9,7,SAM,"But she'd changed, right?"
9,7,DEAN,"I'll bet she gave you that cool action figure, huh?"
9,7,TIMMY,Yeah. When I turned 9.
9,7,SAM,Timmy…
9,7,SAM (continues),...I'm gonna need that action figure.
9,7,TIMMY,No!
9,7,SAM,"It looks like it wasn't the action figure that was anchoring her here, Dean."
9,7,DEAN,Then what is?!
9,7,SAM,Him.
9,7,SAM,You know what?   I think maybe his mom can't let go and she's still protecting him from the grave.
9,7,DEAN,"Protecting him from what?   What, from us?"
9,7,SAM,"Maybe she doesn't know what threats are real and what's not, so she just attacks all of them."
9,7,DEAN,"Great. So, what, unless we waste the kid, we're sitting ducks?"
9,7,ROBIN,This is – this is crazy.
9,7,DEAN,Robin.
9,7,DEAN,"Robin!   Damn it.  (DEAN chases her)  Robin, wait!  (DEAN catches her)"
9,7,ROBIN,Who are you?
9,7,DEAN,Right now I'm the only thing that's keeping you safe.
9,7,SAM,"Timmy, we're gonna need your help, okay?"
9,7,SAM,"Listen to me.  I need you to focus, okay?"
9,7,SAM (continues),"Look, we are not here to hurt you."
9,7,DEAN,Sammy!
9,7,TIMMY,I can't stop her.
9,7,DEAN,"Timmy, you have to try!"
9,7,TIMMY,She's my mom.
9,7,DEAN,"She's a ghost.  Timmy, because she can't move on, she's going crazy.  Okay? You got to let her go.  You'll be okay."
9,7,DEAN (continues),"Listen to me.  Sometimes you got to do what's best for you, even if it's gonna hurt the ones you love."
9,7,DEAN,"Timmy, Kung Fu grip!"
9,7,TIMMY (continues),You have to go.  Never come back.  I'll be okay.  I promise.
9,7,TIMMY (continues),"I love you, too."
9,7,DEAN,Told you it was boring.
9,7,DEAN,"Well, as you can see, I did not run off to become a rock star."
9,7,ROBIN,"Mm... I don't know about that.  You look pretty rockin' to me, Dean Winchester."
9,7,DEAN,And what about you?
9,7,ROBIN,"I mean, I always thought that I would hate being in the same little town my whole life, and, you know, taking over the diner like Dad always wanted, but ... I don't.  I just – I love it."
9,7,DEAN,"I guess we didn't know everything we thought we did at 16, huh?"
9,7,ROBIN,Not everything.  Just some things.
9,7,SONNY,Sounds like Timmy's gonna need some help adjusting.
9,7,DEAN,"Yeah, but he's got you."
9,7,SONNY,"I always hate to see you go, Dee-dawg.  (They clasp hands.)  Can't thank you enough for this one, man.  (they hug.)"
9,7,DEAN,"Sonny, we'll see you around."
9,7,SONNY,"You can bet on that, boys.  Take it easy, man."
9,7,SAM,"Hey, h-how did you know Timmy asking his mom to leave was gonna work?"
9,7,DEAN,I didn't. Total hail Mary. Got lucky.
9,7,SAM,You just got lucky?
9,7,SAM (continues),"Kind of like you did with this place. I mean, here I was thinking this was the worst part of your life, and it turns out it was the best.  Why'd you ever leave?"
9,7,DEAN,Never felt right.
9,7,SAM,Really?
9,7,DEAN,"It was two months, Sam, okay?  And I couldn't wait to get out of here. I don't know what to tell you.  It wasn't me."
9,7,SONNY,"Oh, look at you.  You clean up good!"
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,"Thank you.   You know, uh ... I've never actually been to one of these school dances before."
9,7,SONNY,"Yeah.  Look, about that, Dean, your old man's outside …. and, man, he's really something. I tried to tell him what a big night it was for you, Dean, and ask him if he could come back later, but he just said to tell you he had a job, said you'd know what that means."
9,7,SONNY (continues),"You know, after I got out of jail, this place gave me a second chance, and it's done the same for you, too."
9,7,SONNY (continues),"So if you want, I'll stick my neck out for you, and I'll fight for you to stay."
9,7,YOUNG DEAN,Sonny... ...thank you – for everything.  But I have to go.
9,7,SAM,Dean ... Thank you.
9,7,DEAN,For what?
9,7,SAM,"For always being there, for – having my back.  Look, I know it always hasn't been easy …"
9,7,DEAN,I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
9,9,DEAN,A possession?
9,9,SAM,"I'm a mess, Dean.  You know it."
9,9,DEAN,I can't let you put this on yourself.
9,9,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,"I wouldn't do that, Dean."
9,9,DEAN,"So, he's better?"
9,9,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,Yes.  Sam is much improved.  It shouldn't be much longer now.
9,9,DEAN,"Okay, you know you said the same thing to me last week, right?"
9,9,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,As I told you when we met – this will take time.
9,9,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM (stiffly),"I must say, Dean, I'm very uncomfortable with this whole trip.  Investigating crimes involving angels – or anything involving angels – puts me, and therefore, Sam, at risk."
9,9,DEAN,"Well, family business, Zeke. Okay? If we ignore this, Sam's gonna think that something fishy's going on."
9,9,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,(pause) Then I trust you will be discreet.
9,9,DEAN,"(pause) Wait, if you know where we're going, that means you've been listening in. Are you – are you hearing everything between me and Sam?"
9,9,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,"No. Just a word here and there. I have better things to do with my time than eavesdrop, like heal your brother. (pointedly)"
9,9,DEAN,"Okay, 'cause here's the thing—"
9,9,SAM (unconvinced),"Yeah, maybe."
9,9,DEAN,What?
9,9,SAM,"That sign said ""Fort Collins, 50 miles."""
9,9,DEAN,So?
9,9,SAM,"So, last time I looked, like, 12 seconds ago, uh, Fort Collins was a hundred miles."
9,9,DEAN,"Well, like I've said—"
9,9,SAM,"Yes, the trials.  I know. I heard you.  I heard you when you said it the last week and the week before that and the week before that."
9,9,COP,"Ah, one of your guys is here already."
9,9,CASTIEL,"Um, (sotto voce) I still have that badge you gave me."
9,9,CASTIEL,"The murders were all over the news.  I, I thought I might be of help."
9,9,SAM,"Yeah, but Cas, you know that this is an angel situation, right? I mean, you left that night because angels were on your ass."
9,9,CASTIEL,"If angels are slaughtering one another, I have to do what I can to help.  It is a risk we should be willing to take, don't you think? (SAM shrugs in agreement, seeing the point.) Hey. Cas is back in town."
9,9,DEAN,"Seriously, did you – (to SAM) did he just say that?"
9,9,SAM,Definitely took more than one or two killers to pull this off.
9,9,DEAN,Hit squad?  Bartholomew's people?
9,9,SAM,"Well, Bartholomew has a faction we know about, but this could be somebody else entirely we don't know."
9,9,BARTHOLOMEW’S ASSISTANT,"Good evening, Malachi."
9,9,MALACHI,Where is he?
9,9,BARTHOLOMEW’S ASSISTANT,"Bartholomew is quite busy tonight. With such a large following, well, the responsibilities are enormous."
9,9,MALACHI,I called for a top-level summit.  I don't deal with hand maidens.
9,9,BARTHOLOMEW’S ASSISTANT,(smiles) I'll convey your thoughts to Bartholomew.
9,9,MALACHI,He'll regret the disrespect.
9,9,BARTHOLOMEW’S ASSISTANT,"YOU speak of disrespect, Malachi?  After the bloodbath two nights ago?"
9,9,MALACHI,"Bartholomew's naked grab for power was nothing but disrespect! (voice raises angrily)  He and I ultimately want the same thing.  The only way we can take Heaven back from Metatron is to unite.  And if Bartholomew wants to avoid all-out warfare on Earth, he'll meet personally with me to negotiate terms."
9,9,BARTHOLOMEW’S ASSISTANT,"I'm sorry.  I should've mentioned earlier, Bartholomew said to tell you he doesn't negotiate with street thugs.  (pause; smiles snottily) Are we done here?"
9,9,MALACHI,"Yes, we are."
9,9,MALACHI,And so it begins.
9,9,SAM,Why wouldn't it be okay?
9,9,CASTIEL,"Hey, you once told me that you don't choose what you do. It chooses you."
9,9,DEAN,Huh?
9,9,CASTIEL,I'm a part of this.  (clinks beer bottles with DEAN) Like it or not.
9,9,SAM,"All right, well, then, in that case, we have to figure out, uh, who are we up against, what do they want, and how do we stop them."
9,9,CASTIEL,"Well, Bartholomew wants to reverse Metatron's spell.  Presumably to – to retake Heaven once his following is large enough.  That's according to April."
9,9,DEAN,The reaper you banged.
9,9,CASTIEL,"Yeah, and you stabbed."
9,9,CASTIEL,So hot. And very nice.
9,9,DEAN (appreciatively),Mm.
9,9,CASTIEL,Up to the point she started torturing me.
9,9,DEAN,"Yeah.  Well, not every hookup's perfect.  (DEAN pats CASTIEL’s arm companionably.)"
9,9,EZEKIEL-in-SAM,Well?  What are you going to do about this?
9,9,DEAN,About Cas?
9,9,EZEKIAL-in-SAM,"He is a beacon, Dean, pulling every angel for miles down on our heads."
9,9,DEAN,"All right, you know what, Zeke?  Level with me.  What is it that you're so afraid of?"
9,9,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,"I told you. When I chose to answer your prayers and heal Sam, I chose sides. That means I'm not in good standing with certain angels."
9,9,CASTIEL (returning),Here we go. Three brewskies.
9,9,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM (pissily),I'm going to get something out of the car.
9,9,METATRON,"Well, I'm really looking forward to this."
9,9,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,Excuse me?
9,9,METATRON,"Oh, please.  I know who you really are.  And it isn't Ezekiel."
9,9,DEAN,"Here's the deal.  When Sam was doing the trials to seal up Hell, it messed him up. Okay?  The third one nearly killed him. If I'd let him finish, it would have. He's still messed up, bad."
9,9,CASTIEL,"You said the angel, Ezekiel, helped heal him."
9,9,NOT-EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,"They say he is a good, and ... honorable angel."
9,9,METATRON,Ahhhh.  Everything they say you are not.  I see your point... Gadreel.
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,Not my doing.
9,9,METATRON,"Well, for whatever reason, the serpent entered. The Earth is cursed with evil. Someone had to be blamed."
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"What is it you want of me, Metatron?"
9,9,METATRON,(sighs)  Just to be your friend. You and I go back a long way. I was actually the one who freed you.
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,You?
9,9,METATRON,I was the one who caused all the angels to fall. Including the imprisoned ones.  You're welcome.
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,No angels are in Heaven?  None at all?
9,9,METATRON,"No, and you know, at first, I thought I would love it. But it's a big place. My solitude is getting tedious."
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,And so?
9,9,METATRON,"And so ... Plan ""B."" Rebuild Heaven as the place God envisioned it, only with a handpicked few. No more anemic functionaries like Bartholomew. And no more stupid angels.  (consideringly)  Maybe some funny ones.  You were His most trusted, Gadreel. You want to take back your reputation? You want to reclaim the Heaven that was?  We could do this together."
9,9,SAM,Any word from Cas?
9,9,DEAN,Nothing yet.
9,9,SAM,"And we're not ... worried about him, that he just took off like that again?  I mean, it's not like he does this kind of stuff alone."
9,9,DEAN,"It's the way he wanted it, honestly.  (looking at SAM, who looks unconvinced) Hey, look, man, he's been all over the map since he got his wings clipped. (changing the subject) What do you got? (rolls his chair over to SAM to look at his laptop)  Obituaries.  That one of the bikers?"
9,9,SAM,Yeah. His name was Red Dawg.
9,9,DEAN,Heh. Of course it was.
9,9,SAM,"It's not what you think. Look, he's a family guy. Big in the PTA, he played Santa at Christmas parties."
9,9,DEAN,"So, what? Just one day, he up and joined a biker gang?"
9,9,SAM,"No, he did that years ago. Get this. This is weird. Look. (pulling up news clippings and photos) These are all the victims, right? They were all baptized together."
9,9,DEAN,Baptized?
9,9,SAM,Yeah. They were a born-again biker gang.
9,9,DEAN,"Well, that is not something you hear every day."
9,9,SAM,"No, it's not."
9,9,SAM,"Listen to this.  Red Dawg's widow said he was always religious, but a week before he died, he came home from a prayer meeting and was a changed man filled with divine glory."
9,9,DEAN,"So, Boyle's at it again. Selling folks on being meat suits for angels."
9,9,SAM,Just what – talking to smaller groups now?
9,9,DEAN,"I don't know. Maybe, uh, softening up thousands at a time, he wasn't able to control what angels got let in. This way, Bartholomew's followers can jump in just as soon as Boyle does his thing."
9,9,SAM,"So, Red Dawg and his guys were Bartholomew people?"
9,9,DEAN,"Yeah, and they got slaughtered. Which means that this new group is even worse.  (pause) Haven't I always said that angels are dicks?"
9,9,METATRON,"Frankly, I never got used to them. I lived among them for centuries. I had to isolate myself to keep sane."
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"Humans do seem chaotic, Metatron."
9,9,METATRON,"Which makes them fascinating, but...  All that emotion.  Geez.  And the wasted energy.  It's just... exhausting."
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,I know.  Sam Winchester... It is a mess in here.  And the brother – I do not know where to start.
9,9,METATRON,I can free you from them.  From all of them.
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"You intend to be the ruler of this new Heaven, am I correct?"
9,9,METATRON,Uh... It is a burden I feel I must accept.
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"Then Metatron, does that not make you God?"
9,9,METATRON,"Oh-ho-ho.  Semantics.  I don't know that I'd take on THAT name...necessarily.  No.  When the time comes, we'll call me... ""X."""
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"""X""?"
9,9,METATRON,"You and I ... We could have paradise again, Gadreel."
9,9,CASTIEL,(exhales)
9,9,CASTIEL,You're an angel!
9,9,MURIEL,Muriel (she introduces herself).  I didn't pick the outfit.  (She stares in sudden recognition)  Castiel?  (and turns away to leave)
9,9,CASTIEL,"No, wait – please, just hear me out!"
9,9,MURIEL,It can't be known that I even spoke to you.
9,9,CASTIEL,I just need a moment.
9,9,MURIEL,No.
9,9,CASTIEL,Please.  I just need information.
9,9,KEVIN,"Dean, there may be nothing in here.  Crowley said the spell that cast down the angels was irreversible."
9,9,DEAN,"Yeah, well, screw Crowley.  Why would you think that anything he says is true?"
9,9,KEVIN,"This part is nearly indecipherable.  Almost like, when Metatron wrote it down, he wanted to keep the words hidden, even from Prophets."
9,9,SAM (enters),Hey.
9,9,DEAN,Hey.  Check this out.  Another angel attack.
9,9,SAM,What?  Where?
9,9,DEAN,"Utah.  A, uh, college, uh, Bible-study group and their, uh, their guest speaker – some top-shelf church lady.  Insides scorched out, kids' eyes were missing, but, not the church lady's."
9,9,SAM,"So, she was an angel, too?"
9,9,DEAN,"Sounds like.  Uh, and she sang soprano for the, uh, Melody Ministry Glee Club?"
9,9,SAM,Okay?
9,9,DEAN,"The club goes to its gigs on a bus, so when I checked with the Wyoming cops, they said that a witness saw the same bus leaving the biker bar not long before the bodies were found."
9,9,SAM,"So, church-lady angel was at both killings?"
9,9,DEAN,I'm guessing that she and whoever she's running with killed Bartholomew's bikers at the bar and then Bart's boys hit her back.
9,9,SAM,When she was recruiting those students to be vessels.  (sighs)  Wow. It's a bunch of kids.
9,9,DEAN,Kevin.  Clock's ticking.
9,9,MURIEL,Let's say you're telling the truth and Metatron tricked you.  I should still turn you in.
9,9,CASTIEL,But you won't.
9,9,MURIEL,Don't be so sure.
9,9,CASTIEL,I... I think you instinctively trust me.  We're similar.  We both want no part of the fanatics.
9,9,MURIEL,And when you prayed.  How did you know you wouldn't get one of them?
9,9,CASTIEL,"I'm warded, and my Grace is gone, and I was hoping that I would seem like just another desperate human that the... the militants couldn't care less about."
9,9,CASTIEL,"You're here.
You may know the situation.
Bartholomew, he's in a blood feud with another faction."
9,9,MURIEL,It's madness.
9,9,CASTIEL,Who leads the opposition?
9,9,MURIEL,Malachi.
9,9,CASTIEL,"Malachi?
The anarchist."
9,9,MURIEL,"He's become equals with Bartholomew.  In some ways, worse."
9,9,CASTIEL,But there's still those like you who want to stay out of it.
9,9,MURIEL,Fewer and fewer.  Each side is rounding up those who try and stay neutral.  Angels are being tortured and killed if they don't pledge loyalty.
9,9,CASTIEL,"(sighs) 
It's worse than I thought."
9,9,MURIEL,"Each side wants to crush the other, overthrow Metatron, and rule Heaven, and... Heaven under either of them would be..."
9,9,CASTIEL,Hell.
9,9,MALACHI,"This is a bonus, Castiel.  We were tracking Muriel, cowardly holdout that she is, (MURIEL is shown: She is bound, and bloody and bruised about the face.)  and wonder of wonders, she led us to you. (CASTIEL is also bloody and beaten.)"
9,9,MURIEL,Not knowingly.
9,9,MALACHI,I stand corrected.  Not knowingly.  Stupidly.
9,9,CASTIEL,"I've explained in detail.  I don't know how Metatron's spell worked.  Therefore, I can't assist in reversing it.  I was an unwitting accomplice."
9,9,CASTIEL,No.  I don't.
9,9,MALACHI,(sighs)  Theo.
9,9,CASTIEL,"No!  (THEO pulls his head back, and slides a silver angel knife down CASTIEL's chest) Ahhh, ahhh! (he groans in pain)."
9,9,CASTIEL,"No.  No, she's innocent.  You leave her alone."
9,9,MALACHI,Hm.  I have no intention of touching her.
9,9,MALACHI,Virtue is its own punishment.
9,9,CASTIEL,"Please, no!"
9,9,MURIEL,Nooooo!
9,9,CASTIEL,"Angels butchering angels.
Is this what we've become?"
9,9,All right.,I leave you in the hands of an artist.
9,9,(to THEO),I don't care what's left.
9,9,THEO,"Don't ask for mercy.
There is none."
9,9,THEO,I'll give you one last chance for this to end.
9,9,CASTIEL,Give me a quick death.
9,9,THEO,"I need you to speak to Metatron.
Everyone knows you have influence."
9,9,THEO (continuing),"He'll listen to you.
Ask him to raise me to Heaven.
You can do this, Castiel.
I'll be a soldier for Metatron, do anything he wants."
9,9,CASTIEL,You – you serve Malachi.
9,9,THEO,"I thought he was the answer, but he's crazy."
9,9,CASTIEL,"You're... noticing this now?
You were more than willing to do his dirty work."
9,9,THEO,I did what I had to.
9,9,CASTIEL,When you were sure he would defeat Bartholomew.
9,9,THEO,But no one will survive this war.
9,9,CASTIEL,"So, you prefer to sit it out in Heaven."
9,9,THEO,I can talk to him about restoring your grace.
9,9,CASTIEL (calculating),"Well, it's, um, it's true. Metatron and I do have a working relationship."
9,9,THEO (smiles),I knew it!
9,9,CASTIEL,"You're clever, Theo."
9,9,THEO,You're allies.
9,9,CASTIEL,"And he could use a skilled soldier like yourself.  (CASTIEL pretends to reconsider.) Oh, but I don't know."
9,9,THEO,"I-I'm a team player, Castiel."
9,9,CASTIEL,All right. Well? (gestures at his manacles; THEO opens them up)
9,9,CASTIEL,"I'll – I'll need a moment to make contact.  (THEO waits.)  
And you have something that I'll need."
9,9,THEO,Anything.
9,9,DEAN,Hey.  You seen Sam?
9,9,KEVIN,He went out.
9,9,DEAN,Where?
9,9,KEVIN,I don't know.  You notice he's doing that a lot?
9,9,DEAN (thoughtful),Yeah.
9,9,DEAN,How do you know that?
9,9,CASTIEL,"He had me. I, uh, I was tortured. But I got away."
9,9,DEAN,How?
9,9,CASTIEL,I... I did what I had to. I became what they've become. A barbarian.
9,9,DEAN,"What are you – Cas, where are you?"
9,9,CASTIEL,"It's better I stay away. They're gonna want me even more now. But I'm gonna be all right. I... I got my Grace back. Well, not mine per se, but it'll do."
9,9,CASTIEL,I'm not sure. But I am an angel.
9,9,DEAN,And you're okay with that?
9,9,CASTIEL,"If we're going to war, I need to be ready."
9,9,CASTIEL,Dean. There's more.
9,9,DEAN,What?
9,9,CASTIEL,Didn't you say Sam was healed by an angel named Ezekiel?
9,9,DEAN,"Uh... Yeah, why?"
9,9,CASTIEL,Ezekiel is dead.
9,9,DEAN,What?
9,9,CASTIEL,He died when the angels fell.
9,9,DEAN (urgently),I need a spell.  ASAP.
9,9,DEAN,"All right, listen to me.
An angel can't be expelled by another human.
Okay, only by the host, right?
But, what if there was a way to power down the angel, so that it wasn't in charge for a few seconds?"
9,9,KEVIN,What?
9,9,DEAN,"For instance, if – if hypothetically, I wanted to speak with the vessel but not have the squatter listen in."
9,9,KEVIN,Why?
9,9,DEAN,"Why? Kevin, we've got tons of possessed humans out there. You with me? And when the angels kill each other off, the humans are taking it in the teeth.  So what if I wanted to clue the human in so that he, or she, could spit the angel out? That would be a good thing, right?"
9,9,KEVIN,Uh ... yeah?
9,9,DEAN,"Okay. So, hit the tablet. Let's go!  (DEAN turns to walk out.)"
9,9,KEVIN,Now?
9,9,DEAN,"Yesterday, Cinderella!"
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"I've been thinking this over, Metatron. I will join you as second in command."
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,I thank you for this opportunity.
9,9,METATRON,There is just one more thing.
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,Yes.
9,9,METATRON,I need to be sure of your fidelity.
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,You have it.
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,Slain?
9,9,METATRON,In a word.
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,That... That is not who I am.
9,9,METATRON,"(pulls a yellow card out of his pocket) 
Yeah. (sarcastically)"
9,9,METATRON,Decide.
9,9,DEAN,"All right, so this masterpiece we just painted – it's gonna work, right?"
9,9,KEVIN,The sigils are supposed to briefly hobble the possessing angel.  If the info's correct.
9,9,DEAN,"Wait, what?"
9,9,DEAN,I told you.
9,9,DEAN,"You're gonna have to trust me, okay, trust that I told you everything that I can for now.
Can you do that?"
9,9,DEAN,"Hey, where you been?"
9,9,SAM,Hey. Beer run.
9,9,SAM,Yeah.  Uh... Sure.
9,9,SAM,This sounds serious.
9,9,SAM,What's going on?  What are you doing?
9,9,DEAN,I got to tell you some stuff fast. It's gonna piss you off.
9,9,SAM,Okay.
9,9,DEAN,Those trials really messed you up.
9,9,SAM,"Yes, I know that, Dea—"
9,9,DEAN (hurriedly),"No, you don't. I mean messed you up like almost dead. No more birthdays, dust to dust. Well, that messed me up, so I made a move, okay, a tough move about you without talking it over because you were in a coma."
9,9,SAM,"Wait, what? When?"
9,9,DEAN,"You were in the hospital, okay, and they said you were gonna die."
9,9,SAM,What did you do?
9,9,SAM,In what?
9,9,DEAN,In you. He said he could heal you and he is.
9,9,SAM,"He's still in me?  Wait. (laughs)  That's impossible, Dean. That couldn't happen. I never invited him in."
9,9,DEAN,I tricked you into saying yes. It seemed like the only way.
9,9,SAM,"(sighs) So... Again. You thought I couldn't handle something, so you took over!"
9,9,DEAN,"No, I did what I had to do!  You would've never agreed to it, and you would've died."
9,9,SAM,"Well, maybe I would've liked the choice, at least."
9,9,DEAN,"We can do this – later. You can – you can kick my ass all you want. Right now, we got bigger problems."
9,9,SAM,Bigger?
9,9,DEAN,"The angel lied to me. Okay? He – he's not who he said he was. He said his name was Ezekiel. Cool guy, according to Cas, but it's not Ezekiel."
9,9,SAM,Who is he?
9,9,KEVIN,"Hey, do you notice anything a little bit off about Dean lately?
Between you and me, I'm a little bit worried about him."
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,Don't worry about Dean.  Dean will be fine.
9,9,DEAN,Sam?
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,There is no more Sam.
9,9,DEAN,(gasps in pain)
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"But, I played him convincingly, I thought."
9,9,DEAN,How did you...
9,9,GADREEL-IN-SAM,I heard you talk with Kevin Tran tonight.
9,15,Around 2,00 a.m.

9,22,CASTIEL,Sam and Dean may be a little rough... but they're the best men I've ever known.
