178,DEAN,All you gotta do is bring Sam back.
179,SAM,Did I die? Did you sell your soul for me?  How long'd you get?
179,DEAN,One year.
179,SAM,What kind of blade can kill a demon?
179,BOBBY,Yesterday I'd've said there was no such thing.
179,DEAN,Who was that masked chick?
179,SAM,You ever run across a guy named Gordon Walker?
179,ELLEN,He is dangerous to everyone and everything around him.
179,DEAN,"Gordon should be reachin' for the soap, for the next few years, at least."
179,RUBY,I'm here because I want to help you.
179,SAM,What could you possibly—
179,RUBY,I can help you save your brother.
180,ANDY,"Father, God's not with us. (beat) Not anymore."
180,SAM,"Might've found some omens in Ohio. Dry lightning, barometric-pressure drop."
180,DEAN,"Well, that's thrilling."
180,DEAN,Or it could just be a suicide and a psycho scrapbooker.
180,SAM,"Yeah, but it's our best lead since Lincoln."
180,DEAN,Where in Ohio?
180,SAM,Elizabethville. It's a half-dead factory town in the rust belt.
180,DEAN,There's got to be a demon or two in South Beach.
180,BOBBY,Slow.
180,DEAN,"Eh, I tell you, it's a little sad seeing the Colt like that."
180,BOBBY,"Well, the only thing it's good for now is figuring out what makes it tick."
180,SAM,So what makes it tick?
180,DEAN,"(smiles) All right, come on, we're wasting the daylight."
180,SAM,"See you, Bobby."
180,BOBBY,Hey! You boys run into anything — anything — you call me.
180,DEAN,"Well,this shouldn't take long, then."
180,SAM,When did he stop?
180,SAM,Change how?
180,SAM,Possessed?
180,SAM,"Father, did you know the man who killed those folks in the hobby shop?"
180,SAM,Tony Perkins.
180,SAM,"Would you say that his personality suddenly changed one day, too?"
180,DEAN,Richie.  (The other guy looks up.)  I don't believe it.
180,RICHIE,"Hey, Dean... Winchester, right?"
180,DEAN,Yeah.
180,RICHIE,"This is my sister, uh, Cheryl."
180,CHERYL,Hey.
180,DEAN,Cheryl.
180,DEAN,"Come on in. This is my brother, Sam."
180,RICHIE,Hey. How you doing?
180,SAM,Not too bad. How do you two know each other?
180,DEAN,You were in school.
180,RICHIE,"It was that succubus, in Canarsie right?"
180,DEAN,"Yeah, yeah."
180,RICHIE,"Oh, man. You should have seen the rack on this broad. Freakin' tragedy when I had to gank her."
180,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa. Wait. Who killed her? If I remember, your ass was toast until I showed up."
180,RICHIE,"Oh, I forgot what a comedian this guy was."
180,DEAN,"Richie, Richie, know what?  I told you then and I'll tell you again — you're not cut out for this job. You're gonna get yourself killed."
180,DEAN,"So you find anything in this town, anyway?"
180,DEAN,Yeah.
180,RICHIE,"No, I got nothing."
180,DEAN,Typical. What about your sister back there?
180,SAM,"Yeah, that's where we are, too. You know, let's just say that demons are possessing people in this town.  You know, raising hell—"
180,DEAN,"Yeah, but why would a demon blow his brains out?"
180,RICHIE,"Well, for fun? You know he wrecks one body, moves to another. You know, like taking a stolen car for a joyride."
180,DEAN,"Anybody else left in the town that fits the profile — you know, nice guy turned douche, still breathing?"
180,RICHIE,There's Trotter.
180,SAM,Who's that?
180,RICHIE,"Well, he used to be head of the Rotary Club. And then people say he turned bastard all of a sudden?  Brought in the gambling, the hookers. ... Ah, he practically owns this whole town."
180,SAM,Know where we could find him?
180,RICHIE,"Oh, he'll be at his bar in a few hours."
180,SAM,"It is. At least, it's supposed to be."
180,DEAN,"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's do some research.  (DEAN looks excited to follow a bunch of attractive women.  From a car, a woman in a miniskirt watches him, then gestures for him to come.  DEAN approaches the car and looks at her, smiling; SAM comes back to fetch DEAN and smiles embarrassedly at the woman as he pulls DEAN away."
180,DEAN,"Oh, Richie. Look at you."
180,RICHIE,Hey.
180,DEAN,Bringing satin back.
180,SAM,"How much is ""forget about it""?"
180,RICHIE,"Ah, forget about it. That's Trotter over there. He sits there all night. Can't touch him."
180,SAM,"So,what do we do now?"
180,DEAN,"I don't know about you guys, but I'm gonna do a little investigating with that bartender."
180,RICHIE,"Easy. Me and her, we got a little ... somethin'-somethin' lined up for later."
180,DEAN,"Yeah, right."
180,RICHIE,"Stings, don't it? All right. I got to hit the head, release the hostages. Be back in a few."
180,DEAN,"No way he gets a girl like that. I mean, look at her. You could fit that ass on a nickel."
180,DEAN,"Oh. (laughs) Sorry, Padre."
180,SAM,"No offense, but what are you doing here, Father?"
180,CASEY,"Plus, the clergy drinks for free."
180,CASY,"Not in this lifetime, Father."
180,CASEY,What can I get you boys?
180,DEAN,What's your speciality?
180,CASEY,I make a mean hurricane.
180,DEAN,I guess we'll see about that.
180,DEAN,I do now.
180,JOHN,Reggie. Everything okay with you?
180,REGGIE,I don't know. I'm just not feeling myself today.
180,(JOHN,"Hey, what are you doing?!)"
180,SAM,Somebody call 911!
180,SAM,Too many cops here. I say we roll.
180,DEAN,Just be cool. Poor jerk. Only thing possessing him was a sixer of Pabst.
180,SAM,"So, what's the deal, then?  People in this town getting possessed or not?"
180,DEAN,I don't know. Maybe it is just what it is — town full of scumbags.
180,SAM,Yeah. Maybe.
180,SAM,"Yep, time to go. (rising)"
180,DEAN,Wait a second. Wait a second.
180,SAM,What?
180,DEAN,Where's Richie?
180,RICHIE,"So, how's a bartender afford a place like this?"
180,CASEY,My parents left it to me.  I don't come out here much — mostly when I want to be alone.
180,RICHIE,"Wow. This is, uh, ... charming?   (pause)  You sure you wouldn't be more comfortable in a bedroom or my motel room?  I mean, not for nothing, but, you know, I got oils. (laughs)"
180,CASEY,But I have toys.
180,RICHIE,"Yeah, no. Toys trump oils."
180,DEAN,"How many times i got to tell Richie, he's gonna get himself in trouble?"
180,SAM,"Dean, you're assuming he's missing. I mean, maybe he just bailed."
180,DEAN,"He's a moron. I mean, he's a sweet moron, but he's not a coward. He wouldn't just bail. I got to go find him."
180,SAM,All right.  Meanwhile I think I'm gonna trail this Trotter guy.
180,DEAN,Yeah?
180,RUBY,Cute piece.
180,BOBBY,Who are you?
180,RUBY,"It won't stop a demon, if that's what you think."
180,BOBBY,How the hell would you know?
180,BOBBY,"Well, ain't I lucky, then? Found a subject for a test fire."
180,RUBY,"Luck had nothing to do with it. But, hey, by all means. Take your best shot.  (She poses in front of the target, arms outstretched.)"
180,RUBY,"(sighs in exasperation) Are you gonna stand there like a pantywaist, or are you gonna shoot…"
180,RUBY,Ouch!  That smarts a little.
180,BOBBY,What do you want?
180,RUBY,Peace on earth.  A new shirt. Now ... do you want me to help you out with that gun or not?  Hmm?
180,SAM,Dean. (in a hushed voice)
180,DEAN,Sammy.
180,SAM,Yeah. Hey. I can't talk right now.
180,DEAN,You okay?
180,SAM,"Yeah, I'm fine. Just, uh ...  meet me at the bar in 20 minutes, okay?"
180,DEAN,Sam!
180,DEAN,"Well, hey.  Anybody could have tackled that guy … and wrestled the gun away ... prevented mass murder."
180,WOMAN,What do I look like? (as she walks away) Cheapskate.
180,CASEY,(laughs) Did I just see you strike out with a prostitute? How's that work?
180,DEAN,"Well, I just told her I had a thing for the bartender. It was pretty easy."
180,CASEY,Who says the bartender's available?
180,DEAN,"That's a good question.  You got something going with some guy, you know, about yea tall, wears a sweatsuit ...?"
180,CASEY,Who?
180,DEAN,Naw. My mistake. What do you say you and me grab a drink after your shift?
180,CASEY,I say why wait ... when we can go right now?
180,SAM,I think maybe you know.
180,TROTTER,"Yeah?  Well, I think I'm calling the cops!"
180,TROTTER,"Breaking and entering, assault — you're in a peck of trouble, my friend."
180,SAM,"Uh, wh-, uh ...  I think I could probably explain it—"
180,TROTTER,Money's in the safe! Take it and go.
180,SAM,I don't want your money. I just got to be sure.
180,TROTTER,What kind of psycho are you?
180,DEAN,Looks like the maid's day off.
180,DEAN,"Spiritus immunde, undolara. Pasonitote ..."
180,DEAN,"What are you laughing at, bitch? You're still trapped."
180,CASEY,So are you... bitch.
180,CASEY,Lose something?
180,DEAN,(laughs) All you demons have such smart mouths.
180,CASEY,It's a gift.
180,DEAN,"Yeah, well.  Let's see if you're smiling when I send your ass back to Hell."
180,CASEY,"Without your little exorcism book? Hey, go ahead."
180,CASEY,"Having a little trouble there, sport?"
180,DEAN,"(clears throat, begins again) Spiritus immunde, undolare, Pasonitote. (takes a breath, tries and fails to remember the next phrase)"
180,CASEY,"Nice try, but I think ... you just ordered a pizza. Guess you should have paid more attention in Latin class."
180,DEAN,"Hey, I don't know what you're smiling about. You're not going anywhere."
180,CASEY,"And, apparently, neither are you."
180,CASEY,"Oh, right — Sam. Everyone says he's the brains of the outfit."
180,DEAN,Everyone?
180,CASEY,"Sure. You Winchester boys are famous. Not Lohan famous, but, you know..."
180,DEAN,"Well, that's ... flattering. I'll be sure to let Sam know when he gets here."
180,PROSTITUTE,"You look kind of tense. (SAM looks around to see if she's talking to him.)  You know, I know a surefire way to relax."
180,SAM,Maybe later. (to the bartender:) Excuse me. Hi.
180,BARMAN,What can I get for you?
180,SAM,"Um, you remember the guy I was with last night? We sat right here. Umm...."
180,BARMAN,... The big hero who jumped on Reggie.
180,SAM,"Yeah, yeah. The — the big hero. Right. Um, have you seen him around at all today?"
180,BARMAN,Maybe.  Depends.
180,SAM,D-depends on what?
180,SAM,"Oh my — !   Does everyone around here have their hand out? (sighs, and pulls out some money and hands it to the BARMAN)"
180,BARMAN,He left with Casey about an hour ago.
180,SAM,Any idea where they went?
180,BARMAN,Her place... for Bible study.
180,SAM,"All right, you got an address?"
180,BARMAN,"What's wrong with you? You think I'm gonna give you a co-worker's address, just so you can go over there and get your freaky peeping-tom rocks off?  (without pausing SAM hands more money over)  (without pausing the BARMAN continues)  Corner of Piermont and Clinton. Have fun."
180,CASEY,Why don't you relax?
180,DEAN,Why don't you kiss my ass?
180,CASEY,"Why, Dean, you're a poet. I had no idea. Look, we won't have any effect on the outcome of this. We might as well be civil."
180,DEAN,"Civil, huh? Killing Richie — that was, that was civil? The guy was harmless."
180,CASEY,That knife he pulled on me?  Didn't look so harmless.
180,DEAN,"Ah, a knife wouldn't hurt you."
180,CASEY,"No, but it would damage this body.   And Casey has such a fine body, I wouldn't want to see it ripped."
180,CASEY,"Hey, I didn't pull any triggers."
180,DEAN,Yeah? You did something.
180,CASEY,You want to know what I did — what I really did?  I had lunch.
180,DEAN,Lunch?
180,CASEY,"Me and Trotter. He had a cheeseburger, I had a salad, and I just pointed out the money that could be made with a few businesses that cater to harmless vice.  So Trotter built it, and, man, did they come.  Supposedly God-fearing folk, waist-deep in booze, sex, gambling. I barely lifted a finger."
180,DEAN,That's it?
180,DEAN,And that's how it ends?
180,CASEY,No. That's how it begins.
180,SAM,Dean?
180,SAM,Sulfur.
180,DEAN,"So, demons take over. I thought the meek shall inherit the earth."
180,CASEY,"Oh, according to your Bible. (Off his look.)  It's only a book, Dean."
180,DEAN,Not everyone would agree.
180,CASEY,"Because it's God's book?  (pause)  Do you believe in God, Dean? I'd be surprised if you did."
180,DEAN,I don't know. I'd like to.
180,CASEY,"Don't be hopeful, Dean. You're not delivered.  It's only the wind."
180,BARMAN,I guess you got to catch your jollies another night. Here. Why don't you have a drink ... and relax?
180,BARMAN,Suit yourself — princess.  (The BARMAN takes the shot he had poured for SAM.)
180,SAM,Father.
180,SAM,"Um... can I, can I talk to you for a sec?"
180,DEAN,"You know, you're piling it pretty high there, sweetheart. I'm not sure I'm buying."
180,CASEY,Why would I lie?
180,DEAN,Demons lie.
180,CASEY,Some do.  Some are true believers.
180,DEAN,Believers in what?
180,CASEY,"What, you think humans have an exclusive on a higher power?"
180,CASEY,Sure. His name's Lucifer.
180,DEAN,You mean the Devil?
180,DEAN,Lucifer's really real?
180,CASEY,"Well, no one's actually seen him, but they say that he made us into what we are, and they say that he'll return."
180,DEAN,"Oh, yeah? And, uh, you believe that?"
180,CASEY,I've got faith.
180,DEAN,Mmm.
180,CASEY,"So, you see? Is my kind really all that different than yours?"
180,DEAN,"Well, except that, uh, demons are evil."
180,CASEY,…and humans are such a lovable bunch. (beat) Dick Cheney.
180,DEAN,He one of yours?
180,CASEY,Not yet. Let's just say he's got a parking spot reserved for him downstairs.
180,DEAN,"(laughs) Hey, speaking of downstairs ... what's it like down there?"
180,CASEY,"What, Hell?"
180,DEAN,Yeah.
180,SAM,"So, the, the bartender the other night, Casey.  You know her pretty well?"
180,SAM,"Well, um, she and my brother, they, uh... (pauses, thinking how to say this) they... left tonight. Together."
180,SAM,Right.
180,SAM,"Right, right. Well, well we are. Um, it's like, it's like a family business, you know?"
180,SAM,"Anyways, um, so, so, I went to Casey's apartment, and they weren't there.  I, I, I just have this feeling that they ... that they might be in trouble."
180,SAM,"Just ... trouble. Look, please, Father, I, I need your help. Is there anything you could tell me about Casey — anyplace she'd go, maybe ...?"
180,SAM,"No, wait, wait, wait, Father. I can do this by myself."
180,CASEY,"Kind of funny, don't you think? You and me sitting here like a couple of regular folk."
180,DEAN,"Yeah, it's hilarious, you know, in that ... apocalyptic sort of way."
180,CASEY,"You're all right, Dean.  (DEAN scoffs.)  The others don't describe you that way.  But, you know, you're — you're likable."
180,CASEY,"You could say thanks. (pause) That deal you made to save Sam — a lot of others would mock you for it, think it was weak or stupid. I don't."
180,DEAN,"It's been kind of liberating, actually. Y’know, what's the point in worrying about a future, when you don't have one?"
180,CASEY,"Still, a year left. You're not scared?"
180,DEAN,Nah.
180,CASEY,Not even a little?
180,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I ... like being able to help people."
180,SAM,Like what?
180,SAM,"I don't know. I like doing what I'm doing, I guess."
180,SAM,"Yeah, Dean."
180,SAM,"Yeah.  Yeah, Dean finds his fair share."
180,CASEY,I'm an open book.
180,DEAN,"So, the gate opened. The demon army was let out. What now, huh? I'm not seeing a big, honking plan here."
180,CASEY,"Honestly, there was a plan.  Azazel was a tyrant, but ... he held us all together."
180,DEAN,Azazel?
180,CASEY,"What, you think his friends just called him “yellow eyes”? He had a name. After you did him in, it all fell apart."
180,CASEY,"There was. It was Sam. Sam was supposed to be the grand pooh-bah and lead the big army, but ... he hasn't exactly stepped up to the plate, has he?"
180,DEAN,Thank God for that.
180,SAM,Dean?!
180,CASEY,Looks like you win.
180,DEAN,Sam!
180,SAM,Dean?
180,DEAN,"Sammy, down here! The basement caved in!"
180,DEAN,Who's we?
180,SAM,I'm here with the Father.
180,DEAN,"Sammy, be careful."
180,SAM,"Bobby, you all right?"
180,SAM,How did you know where we—
180,CASEY,Stop!
180,CASEY,Leave him be.
180,DEAN,"Sam, wait!"
180,BOBBY,Two less demons to worry about. That's not nothing.
180,DEAN,"Yeah, but Trotter's still alive."
180,BOBBY,Humans ain't our job.
180,DEAN,"Yeah, but you think anything's really gonna change? I mean maybe these people do just want to really destroy themselves. Maybe it is ... a losing battle."
180,BOBBY,Is that you or the demon girl talking?
180,DEAN,"Ohhhh, it's me. Demon is dead, and so is that hot girl it was possessing."
180,BOBBY,"(sighs)  Well, had to be done. Sam was saving your life."
180,BOBBY,Yeah?
180,DEAN,"Back in Wyoming, uh, there was this moment. Yellow Eyes said something to me."
180,BOBBY,What'd he say?
180,DEAN,"That maybe when ... Sam came back from (shrugs) well wherever, ... that maybe he came back different."
180,BOBBY,Different how?
180,DEAN,"I don't know. Whatever it was, it didn't sound good. You think ... think something's wrong with my brother?"
180,BOBBY,(pauses briefly) No. Demons lie. I'm sure Sam's okay.
180,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, me too."
180,RUBY,Leaving so soon? We haven't even had a chance to celebrate.
180,SAM,"Yeah, well you can celebrate without me."
180,RUBY,"You're not gonna get all pouty on me now, are you? Come on! You killed two demons today."
180,SAM,"Yeah, well, maybe you don't care, but I killed two humans, too."
180,RUBY,"Sam, you know what happens when demons piggyback humans. They leave them rode hard and put up wet. Chances are those two would have died a slow, sticky death. You probably did them a favor."
180,SAM,"Did them a favor? You're a cold bitch, you know that?"
180,RUBY,"Yeah, and this cold bitch has saved your ass a couple of times now. Some respect might be nice. Especially if you want me to help you out with Dean and his little problem."
180,SAM,"You know what? You keep dangling that, but last I checked, Dean's still going to Hell."
180,RUBY,"Everything in its own time, Sam. But there’s a quid pro quo here. We're in a war."
180,SAM,"Right.  But for some reason, you're fighting on our team. Now, tell me, why is that again?"
180,RUBY,"Go screw yourself, that's why."
180,SAM,Oh I see.
180,RUBY,"I don't have to justify my actions to you, Sam.  If you don't want my help, fine.  Then give me the gun and I'll pass it on to someone who will use it."
180,SAM,"Well, I don't have to like it."
180,RUBY,"No. You wouldn't be Sam if you did. On the bright side, I'll be there with you.  (SAM swallows nervously, looking unhappy.)  That little fallen angel on your shoulder."
181,DEAN,"Look, Dad's gone now, and we have to carry out his legacy.  Huntin' down as many evil sons of bitches as we possibly can."
181,SAM,Okay.
181,DEAN,Wanna know how many how many were little girls with black hair and pale skin?
181,SAM,Zero.
182,DEAN,"So, I've been waiting since Maple Springs. You got something to tell me?"
182,DEAN,No.
182,SAM,"... Happy Purim? (laughs)  Dude, I don't know. I have no idea what you're talking about—"
182,SAM,Dean ...
182,SAM,"You went after her, didn’t you? The Crossroads Demon. After I told you not to."
182,SAM,"Yeah, well..."
182,SAM,I didn't.
182,DEAN,And you shot her.
182,SAM,She was a smartass!
182,SAM,"Don't you think I might have mentioned that little fact, Dean?  No.  Someone else holds the contract."
182,DEAN,Who?
182,SAM,She wouldn't say.
182,DEAN,"Well, we should find out who. Of course, our best lead would be the Crossroads Demon. Oh, wait a minute..."
182,SAM,That's not funny.
182,DEAN,"No, it's not! It was a stupid freaking risk, and you shouldn't have done it."
182,SAM,"I shouldn't have done it? You're my brother, Dean. And no matter what you do, I'm gonna try and save you. And I'm sure as hell not gonna apologize for it, all right?"
182,GERT,But I don't understand. I already went over all this with the other detectives.
182,DEAN,"Right, yes. But, see, we're with the Sheriff's Department, not the police department – different departments."
182,SAM,"So, Mrs. Case..."
182,SAM,"Uh... Well, no. No, not yet."
182,GERT,I see.
182,DEAN,A boat?
182,GERT,"Yes. One minute it was there, then it was gone. It just disappeared right before her eyes. You think it could be a ... ghost ship? Alex thinks it could be a ghost ship.  (She is addressing all her comments to SAM, staring at him intently.)"
182,DEAN,What a crazy old broad.
182,SAM,Why? Because she believes in ghosts?
182,DEAN,"(laughs)  Look at you, sticking up for your girlfriend. You cougar hound."
182,SAM,Bite me.
182,DEAN,"Hey, not if she bites you first. So, who's this Alex? We got another player in town?"
182,SAM,"Maybe, maybe not. Doesn't change our job."
182,DEAN,"And what looked like a ghost ship, right?"
182,SAM,"Yeah. Every 37 years, like clockwork, reports of a vanishing three-mast clipper ship out in the bay. And every 37 years, a rash of weirdo, dry-land drownings."
182,DEAN,"So, whatever's happening is just getting started."
182,SAM,Yeah.
182,DEAN,What's the lore?
182,DEAN,"So, what happens?  You see the ship and then a few hours later, you pucker up and kiss your ass goodbye?"
182,SAM,Basically.
182,DEAN,What's the next step?
182,SAM,I gotta I.D. the boat.
182,DEAN,"That shouldn't be too hard. I mean, how many three-mast clipper ships have wrecked off the coast?"
182,SAM,"I checked that too, actually. Over one hundred and fifty."
182,DEAN,Wow.
182,SAM,Yeah.
182,DEAN,Crap.
182,SAM,Mm-hmm.
182,DEAN,"This is where we parked the car, right?"
182,SAM,I thought so.
182,DEAN,Where's my car?
182,SAM,Did you feed the meter?
182,SAM,"Hey, hey, hey!  Calm down.  Dea—"
182,SAM,"(after looking around, hears DEAN gasping and runs over to him)
Whoa. Dean. Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy."
182,SAM,Bela.
182,BELA,I'm sorry. I had that car towed.
182,DEAN,You what?!
182,BELA,"Well, it was in a tow-away zone."
182,SAM,You're Alex. You're working with that old lady.
182,BELA,Gert's a dear old friend.
182,DEAN,"Yeah, right. What's your angle?"
182,BELA,"There's no angle. There's a lot of lovely old women like Gert up and down the eastern seaboard. I sell them charms, perform séances so they can commune with their dead cats."
182,DEAN,"And let me guess, it's all a con, none of it's real."
182,BELA,The comfort I provide them is very real.
182,SAM,How do you sleep at night?
182,BELA,"On silk sheets, rolling naked in money.  (DEAN visualizes, nods slightly.)  Really, Sam. I'd expect the attitude from him, but you?"
182,DEAN,"You do know what's going on around here. This ghost-ship thing, it is real."
182,BELA,"I'm aware. Thanks for telling Gert the case wasn't solved, by the way."
182,DEAN,It isn't.
182,BELA,She didn't know that. Now the old bag's stopped payment and she's demanding some real answers. Look... just stay out of my way before you cause any more trouble. I'd get to that car if I were you... before they find the arsenal in the trunk.  (She turns around.)  Ciao.
182,DEAN,Can I shoot her?
182,SAM,Not in public.
182,BELA,"I am so sorry for your loss, Mr. Warren. Now, if you could just tell me one more time about the ship your brother saw."
182,DEAN,"Ma'am, I think this man's been through quite enough. You should go."
182,BELA,But I just have a few more questions.
182,DEAN,"Sorry you had to deal with that. They're like ROACHES (his voice raises so that BELA, walking away, can hear; she turns and looks back at him)"
182,DEAN,Did he tell you what it looked like?
182,SAM,That's a lot of detail for a ship your brother saw.
182,DEAN,"All right. Well, we'll be in touch."
182,SAM,Thank you.
182,BELA,I see you got your car back.
182,DEAN,You really want to come near me when I got a loaded gun in my hands?
182,BELA,"Now, now. Mind your blood pressure. Why are you even still here? You have enough to I.D. the boat."
182,SAM,That guy back there saw the ship.
182,BELA,Yeah? And?
182,SAM,"And, he's going to die, so we have to save him."
182,BELA,How sweet.
182,DEAN,You think this is funny?
182,BELA,"He's cannon fodder. He can't be saved in time, and you know it."
182,DEAN,"Yeah, well, see, we have souls, so ... we're gonna try."
182,BELA,"Yeah, well, I'm actually going to find the ship and put an end to this. But you have fun."
182,DEAN,"Hey, Bela, how'd you get like this, huh? What, did Daddy not give you enough hugs or something?"
182,BELA,I don't know. Your daddy give you enough? Don't you dare look down your nose at me. You're not better than I am.
182,DEAN,We help people.
182,BELA,"(scoffs) Come on. You do this out of vengeance and obsession. You're a stone's throw from being a serial killer. Whereas I, on the other hand, I get paid to do a job and I do it. So, you tell me – which is healthier?"
182,SAM,"Bela, why don't you just leave? We've got work to do."
182,BELA,Yeah. You're 0 for 2. Bang-up job so far.
182,DEAN,Anything good?
182,SAM,"No, not really. I mean, both brothers are Duke University grads. No criminal record. I mean, a few speeding tickets. They inherited their father's real estate fortune six years ago."
182,DEAN,How much?
182,SAM,$112 million.
182,SAM,"Yeah. I mean, nice, clean, aboveboard. So why did they see the ship? Why Sheila, too? What do they all have in common?"
182,DEAN,Maybe nothing.
182,SAM,No. There's always something.
182,PETER,What are you guys doing?! You watching me?
182,SAM,"Sir, calm down. Please."
182,PETER,You guys aren't cops! Not dressed like that. Not – not in that crappy car.
182,DEAN,"Whoa, hey. No need to get nasty."
182,SAM,"We are cops, okay? We're undercover. We're here because we think you're in danger."
182,PETER,From who?!
182,SAM,"If you just settle down, we'll talk about it."
182,SAM,Wait!
182,DEAN,"Hey, you moron! We're trying to help you!"
182,DEAN,That can't be good.
182,SAM,Peter!
182,DEAN,Sam!
182,DEAN,(Shuts off radio) Do you wanna say it or should I?
182,SAM,What?
182,DEAN,"You can't save everybody, Sam."
182,SAM,"Yeah, right, so – so what, you feel better now or what?"
182,DEAN,"No, not really."
182,SAM,Me neither.
182,DEAN,You gotta understa—
182,BELA,"That well, huh?"
182,DEAN,"If you say 'I told you so', I swear to God I'll start swinging."
182,BELA,"Look, I think the three of us should have a heart-to-heart."
182,DEAN,That's assuming that you have a heart.
182,BELA,"Dean, please... I'm sorry about what I said before, okay? I come bearing gifts."
182,SAM,Such as?
182,BELA,I've ID'd the ship. (She starts to unzip a portfolio file.)
182,SAM,Which would explain the 37 year cycle.
182,BELA,Aren't you a sharp tack? (beat) There's a photo of him somewhere ... (flipping through file) ... here.
182,DEAN,Isn't that the customer we saw last night?
182,BELA,You saw him?
182,DEAN,"Yeah, that's him, except he was missing a hand."
182,BELA,His right hand?
182,SAM,How'd you know?
182,BELA,"The sailor's body was cremated, but not before they cut off his hand to make a hand of glory."
182,DEAN,A hand of glory?  I think I got one of those at the end of my Thai massage last week (laughs).
182,SAM,"Dean, the right hand of a hanged man is a serious occult object.  It's very powerful."
182,BELA,So they say.
182,DEAN,And officially counts as remains.
182,SAM,"But still, none of this explains why the ghost is choosing these victims."
182,BELA,"I'll tell you why.  Who cares? Find the hand, burn it, and stop the bloody thing."
182,DEAN,I don't get it. Why are you telling us all of this?
182,BELA,Because I know exactly where the hand is.
182,DEAN,Where?
182,BELA,At the Sea Pines Museum. It's a macabre bit of maritime history. But I need help.
182,SAM,What kind of help?
182,BELA,(to DEAN) What is taking so long? Sam's already halfway there... with his date.
182,DEAN,So not okay with this!
182,BELA,"What are you, a woman? Come down already."
182,DEAN,"All right, get it out – I look ridiculous."
182,BELA,Not exactly the word I'd use.
182,DEAN,What?
182,BELA,"You know, when this is over, we should really have angry sex."
182,DEAN,(beat; shifts uncomfortably) Don't objectify me. (beat) Let’s go.
182,BELA,"Are you chewing gum? (beat) Try to behave as if you've lived this life before, yeah?"
182,GERT,"This'll get their tongues wagging, eh, my Adonis?"
182,SAM,"(sighs) Just remember, we're on business."
182,GERT,"Ooooh, but sometimes business can be pleasure, hmm?  (she slides a hand up his chest seductively)"
182,SAM,"You know, uh, could you excuse me for a moment?"
182,GERT,Of course.  (She makes a sort of coochie-coo expression at SAM.)
182,SAM,Great.  Thanks.  Thanks.  (SAM pats her hand and walks over to BELA and DEAN.) Exactly how long do you expect me to entertain my date?
182,BELA,As long as it takes.
182,DEAN,"Look, there's security all over this place, all right. This is an uncrashable party without Gert's invitation, so..."
182,SAM,"We can crash anything, Dean."
182,DEAN,"Yeah, I know, but this is easier and it's a lot more entertaining."
182,SAM,"You know there are limits to what I'll do, right?"
182,DEAN,"Ah, he's playing hard to get, that's cute. Come on. (sighs) I want all the details in the morning!"
182,BELA,Thank you.
182,GERT,To us.
182,BELA,Private security?
182,DEAN,I don't think so. Look at the way they're standing.  They're pros. Probably state troopers moonlighting.
182,BELA,"Posted to every door, too."
182,DEAN,"Yeah, I don't think we're just going to be able to waltz upstairs."
182,BELA,What do you suggest?
182,DEAN,I'm thinking.
182,BELA,Don't strain yourself. (beat)  Interesting how the legend is so much more than the man.
182,DEAN,"You got any bright ideas, I'm all ears."
182,BELA,"Okay. (BELA groans and falls into DEAN's arms toward the floor. DEAN, holding her, kneels down next to her.)"
182,DEAN,"Honey?  Honey, are you all right?  (DEAN looks around, calls a waiter over.)  Waiter!  Hi.  Uh, my wife has a severe shellfish allergy. Th-ere's no crab in that?  Is there?"
182,WAITER,"No, sir."
182,DEAN,"No?  (He takes an appetizer from the silver tray and shoves it in his mouth.) Oh they're excellent, by the way. (talking with his mouth full)"
182,DEAN,"Ah ... champagne!  My wife, she's a lightweight when it comes to the sauce. Is there somewhere I can lay her down till she gets her sea legs back?"
182,DEAN,"Right. (Hands BELA's purse to the GUARD.)  Thank you. (DEAN groans as he lifts BELA up)  Come on, you lush."
182,BELA,I didn't want you thinking.  You're not very good at that.
182,BELA,"Oh, look at you.  Searching for a witty rejoinder."
182,DEAN,Screw you.
182,GERT,Where's Alex and your friend? They're missing a great party.
182,SAM,"Umm, ah, I'm sure they’re entertaining themselves."
182,GERT,"Oooh, naughty. Then I guess we'll just have to entertain ourselves as well."
182,GERT,Call me Gert.
182,SAM,(makes an awkward noise) Okay.
182,SAM,Whoa-oa!  Unh....
182,GERT,"Mmmm, you're just firm all over, ooh, mmm.  (laughs and moans)"
182,GUARD,Sir? Ma'am? Everything all right?
182,BELA,"(answers the door clutching at her dress, gasping, and smiling as if caught in the act) Hi."
182,GUARD,"Feeling better, I see."
182,BELA,"Yes, much.  Thank you."
182,GUARD,"So, if you're done with the room...?"
182,BELA,Well... not exactly.  Could we have a few more minutes?
182,GUARD,Uh....  Yes ma'am.
182,BELA,"(BELA closes the door and giggles loudly: ""Stop it!  That tickles!"")"
182,DEAN,"Whoa.  Sorry!  It's, uh ... nature called."
182,GUARD,Ah huh.
182,DEAN,Thanks for looking after my wife.
182,GUARD,"Oh, she's ... being looked after, all right."
182,DEAN,Any trouble?
182,BELA,Nothing I couldn't handle. The hand?  (DEAN pulls a wizened human hand out of his pocket. BELA approaches and holds out her own hand.)  May I?
182,DEAN,"No.  (DEAN pulls it back away from her, then unfolds a handkerchief to wrap it.)"
182,BELA,It might be more inconspicuous in my purse.
182,DEAN,Nice try.
182,BELA,Just trying to be helpful.
182,DEAN,"Well, sweetheart, I don't need your kind of help.  (DEAN tucks the hand back into his jacket pocket.)"
182,SAM,"Man, this is one long song."
182,GERT,(Breathes deeply) I hope it never ends. (pause while SAM looks deeply pained) How's the investigation going?
182,SAM,These things take time.
182,GERT,People are talking about the Warren brothers’ deaths. Strange. Do you think it’s connected to Shelia's?
182,SAM,"Yeah.  Yeah, we think so."
182,GERT,"I think they had it coming, you know. In a Biblical sort of way."
182,SAM,What do you mean?
182,GERT,You know about their father?
182,SAM,No?
182,GERT,"Come here, I'll whisper it to you."
182,SAM,(as GERT pulls his head down to her mouth) Uh—
182,SAM,"Okay, okay, okay.  (wincing and pulling away)  Um, um, so did, did, did Sheila have any connection to them?"
182,GERT,"Well, none that I know of."
182,SAM,Did Sheila have any kind of tragedy in her life?
182,GERT,Yes.  As a matter of fact there was a ... car accident when she was a teenager.
182,SAM,What happened?
182,GERT,"Her car flipped over.  She was okay but her cousin Brian was killed. Why, is that important?"
182,SAM,Uh...
182,BELA,Well!  Having a nice time?
182,BELA,Oh!
182,BELA,(whispering to SAM & DEAN) I'm going to get Gert into a cold shower.
182,SAM,Great idea.
182,DEAN,You stink like sex.
182,SAM,"You got it, right? Tell me I didn't get groped all night by Mrs. Havisham for nothing."
182,DEAN,I got it... Mrs. Who?
182,SAM,Never mind.  Just let me see it.
182,SAM,What?
182,DEAN,I'm gonna kill her.
182,BELA,"Oh, no."
182,DEAN,"You know what, you’re right. I'm not gonna kill her. I think slow torture's the way to go."
182,SAM,"Dean, look, you gotta relax."
182,DEAN,"Relax!  Oh yeah, yeah, I'll relax.  I can't believe she got another one over on us!"
182,DEAN,What?
182,SAM,"I...I mean, she got ... one over ... on you, ... not us."
182,BELA,Hello?  Could you open up? (DEAN opens the door) Just let me explain.  (SAM and DEAN look pissed.)
182,SAM,So the whole reason for us going to the charity ball was...?
182,BELA,I needed a cover. (SAM nods.)  You were convenient.
182,SAM,"Look, you sold it to a buyer. Just go buy it back."
182,BELA,It's halfway across the ocean. I can't get it back in time.
182,DEAN,In time for what?
182,SAM,"What's going on with you, Bela? You look like you've seen a ghost."
182,BELA,I saw the ship.
182,DEAN,"You what?  (pause) Wow, you know, I – I knew you were an immoral thieving con artist bitch, but just when I thought my opinion of you couldn't get any lower—"
182,BELA,What are you talking about?
182,SAM,We figured out the spirit’s motive. (He shows BELA a photograph) This is the captain of our ship. The one who hung our ghost boy.
182,BELA,So?
182,SAM,"So they were brothers. Very Cain and Abel. So now our spirit, he's going after a very specific kind of target – people who've spilled their own family’s blood.  (BELA looks stunned.)  See first there was Sheila who killed her cousin in the car accident, and the Warren brothers, who murdered their father for the inheritance.  And now you."
182,BELA,Oh my God.
182,DEAN,"So who was it, Bela?  Hmm?  Who'd you kill?  Was it Daddy?  Your little sis, maybe?"
182,BELA,It's none of your business.
182,DEAN,"No?  Riight.  Well, have a nice life – you know, whatever’s left of it.  (DEAN slaps her on the back.)  Sam, let’s go."
182,BELA,You can't just leave me here.
182,DEAN,Watch us.
182,BELA,"Please.  (SAM looks down, moved.)  I need your help."
182,DEAN,Our help? Now how could a couple of serial killers possibly help you?
182,BELA,"Okay, that was a bit harsh, I admit it, but it doesn't warrant a death sentence."
182,SAM,"That's not why you’re gonna die. What'd you do, Bela?"
182,BELA,"You wouldn't understand.  No one did. Never mind.  I'll just do what I've always done, I'll deal with it myself."
182,DEAN,You do realize you just sold the one thing that could save your life.
182,SAM,Well ... (sighs) maybe not the only thing.
182,DEAN,Sammy!  You better start reading.
182,BELA,Behind you!
182,DEAN,"Sammy, read faster!"
182,BELA,You boys should learn to lock your doors. Anyone could just barge in.
182,SAM,Anyone just did. Did you come to say goodbye or thank you?
182,BELA,"I've come to settle affairs. Giving the spirit what he really wanted, his own brother – very clever, Sam. So here. (She tosses them each a packet of money.)  It's ten thousand – that should cover it. (The boys look at the packets of money and then at BELA.)   I don't like being in anyone’s debt."
182,DEAN,So ponying up ten grand is easier for you than a simple thank you?  (She smiles faintly. DEAN shakes his head.)  You're so damaged.
182,BELA,(her smile broadens) Takes one to know one. Goodbye lads. (she turns around leaves)
182,SAM,She got style. You gotta give her that.
182,DEAN,I suppose.
182,SAM,"You know, Dean, we don't know where this money's been."
182,DEAN,"No, but I know where it's going... A-HA HA!"
182,SAM,Seriously? Atlantic City?
182,DEAN,"You know, situation was reversed, I guess I'd've done the same thing. (pause) I mean I'm not blind, I see what you're going through with this whole deal, me going away and all that. But you're gonna be okay."
182,DEAN,"Yeah, you'll keep hunting, y'know, you live your life. You’re stronger than me.  You are!  (SAM clears his throat) you are... you'll get over it. But I want you to know I'm sorry, I’m sorry for... putting you through all this, I am."
182,SAM,"You know what, Dean?  Go screw yourself."
182,DEAN,What?
182,SAM,"I don't want an apology from you!  And by the way, I'm a big boy now, I can take care of myself."
182,DEAN,"Oh, well, excuse me."
182,DEAN,I think maybe I'll play craps.
183,BELA,It's rude to sneak up on people.
183,GORDON,Bela Talbot.
183,BELA,You have me at a disadvantage. I don't know who you are.
183,GORDON,Gordon Walker.
183,BELA,(pause)  I've heard of you. Heard you were in prison.
183,GORDON,Got out.
183,BELA,Released early on good behavior?
183,BELA,I don't think I know.
183,BELA,"Put that down.  (He doesn't.)  What's so pressing about finding the boys, anyway?"
183,GORDON,Sam Winchester's the Antichrist.
183,BELA,Mmm.  I'd heard something about that...
183,GORDON,It's true.
183,BELA,"... from my good friend, the Easter Bunny, who'd heard it from the Tooth Fairy. Are you off your meds?"
183,GORDON,"The world hangs in the balance. So you go ahead and be a smart-ass, but tell me where they are, or I shoot."
183,BELA,"Gordon, you and I don't know each other very well, so let me tell you a little something about me. I don't respond well to threats, but you make me an offer?  And I think you'll find me highly cooperative."
183,BELA,Kill me. Good luck finding Sam and Dean.
183,BELA,I don't get out of bed for three grand.
183,GORDON,You...
183,BELA,"Scratch that. Give me the mojo bag, and we'll call it even."
183,GORDON,"Oh, hell no. This thing's a century old. It's..."
183,BELA,"Priceless. Believe me, I know. Now, how badly do you want the Winchesters?"
183,BELA,"Hello, Dean? Hey, where are you?"
183,SAM,"Hey, hey. Don't worry. We're gonna call you some help, okay?"
183,DEAN,Where is she? Where'd she go?!
183,DEAN,What?
183,SAM,"Cutting it a little close, don't you think?"
183,DEAN,"Ah ... that's just chum in the water. Worked, didn't it?"
183,DEAN,Ow.
183,DEAN,Your nest... where you and your bloodsucking pals hang out.
183,VAMPIRE,I don't know what you're talking about. (SAM and DEAN look at each other and roll their eyes.)  Please! I don't feel good.
183,DEAN,"Yeah, well, you're gonna feel a hell of a lot worse if we give you another shot of dead man's blood."
183,VAMPIRE,Just let me go.
183,SAM,"(laughs)  Yeah, you know we can't do that."
183,VAMPIRE,I'm telling you the truth. I'm just... I took something. I'm freaking out! I don't know what's going on!
183,SAM,You took something?
183,SAM,What's your name?
183,VAMPIRE,Lucy. Please.  Just let me go.
183,SAM,"All right, Lucy, how about this? If you tell us what happened, we'll let you go."
183,SAM,Spider?
183,LUCY,"The club, on Jefferson. And there was this guy... he was buying me drinks."
183,SAM,This guy... what's he look like?
183,LUCY,"He was old, like thirty. He had brown hair, a leather jacket... uh, Deacon or Dixon or something. Said he was a dealer... he had something for me."
183,DEAN,Something?
183,LUCY,"Something new. ""Better than anything you've ever tried."" He put a few drops in my drink."
183,LUCY,What?
183,DEAN,"Yeah, you just took a big steamin' shot of the nastiest virus out there."
183,LUCY,"You're crazy! He gave me roofies or something! No... The next thing I know, we're at his place, and he says he's gonna get me something to eat, just wait. But I get so hungry."
183,DEAN,So you busted out?
183,DEAN,Lights are too bright? Sunshine hurt your skin?
183,DEAN,"Well, I hate to tell you this, sweetheart, but your blood's never pumping again."
183,DEAN,"All right, listen, Wavy Gravy.  It's not going to stop. You've already killed two people, almost three."
183,LUCY,"(sobbing) No, I couldn't. No-!  I was hallucinating!"
183,DEAN,"You killed them, all right? We've been following a sloppy trail of corpses, and it leads straight to you."
183,LUCY,"No. No, it wasn't real! It was the drug! Please! Please, you have to help me!"
183,LUCY,"No, no."
183,DEAN,We don't have a choice.
183,LUCY,No... please!
183,GORDON,Sir.  A few questions about the attack.
183,MAN,I already talked to the cops.
183,MAN,FBI?
183,KUBRICK,Can you describe your attacker?
183,MAN,"Uh .... She was crazy. She had that, uh, super-PCP strength, you know? She GNAWED on my neck."
183,GORDON,And did she bleed on you?
183,MAN,On me?  No.
183,MAN,"Yeah, I'm sure. Why do you ask?"
183,GORDON,This woman has a very dangerous virus.
183,MAN,What? She bit me in the neck!
183,KUBRICK,The bite doesn't matter. You have to actually ingest the blood to be infected.
183,MAN,(sighs in relief)
183,GORDON,"Good thing, too. We'd have had to kill you."
183,GORDON,The attack?
183,MAN,"She jumped me, then bit me. Then those two guys found me and chased her down the alley."
183,GORDON,What did they look like?
183,MAN,"Ah, I didn't get a good look."
183,GORDON,Think.
183,MAN,One of them was real tall.
183,DEAN,"That was a big, fat waste of time."
183,SAM,"Look, three blondes have gone missing, including Lucy, all last sighted here. I'm telling you, Dean, this is the hunting ground."
183,GIRL,You're sick. (laughing)
183,MAN,"You ready, sweetie? One taste of this, you'll never be the same."
183,SAM,Get out of here. go! go!
183,SAM,Dean!
183,DEAN,All right. Run. I'll draw them off.
183,SAM,"What?! No, you're crazy!"
183,SAM,There you are!
183,SAM,"Nice move you pulled back there, Dean running right at the weapons!"
183,SAM,"Uh, yeah, I guess so. You know, how the hell did he know where to find us?"
183,DEAN,"Question for you. When you called me yesterday, it wasn't to thank me for saving your ass, was it?"
183,DEAN,Excuse me?
183,BELA,"Ah.  I did fully intend to call, I just got a bit sidetracked."
183,DEAN,He tried to kill us!
183,DEAN,"Bela, if we make it out of this alive, the first thing I'm gonna do is kill you."
183,BELA,You're not serious.
183,DEAN,Listen to my voice and tell me if I'm serious.
183,GORDON,Who are they?
183,VAMPIRE,Family.
183,GORDON,You always keep your family in shackles?
183,VAMPIRE,We're still getting to know each other. They have just been reborn.
183,GORDON,You mean you grabbed some poor girls off the street and made them monsters like you.
183,VAMPIRE,"I do what I have to. We're a dying breed. But then, you know that, don't you Gordon? Gordon. Walker. One of the greatest  living vampire hunters."
183,GORDON,In the flesh.
183,VAMPIRE,"You're a big part of why my people are nearly extinct, Gordon."
183,VAMPIRE,Watch your mouth.
183,GORDON,"Oh, did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry. I forgot you're just a misunderstood victim. Even though you murder and spread your filthy disease on pure base instinct. You got less humanity than a sewer rat."
183,VAMPIRE,I'm sorry you have such a low opinion of my people.
183,GORDON,"Oh, you have no idea."
183,SAM,"That vampire's still out there, Dean."
183,DEAN,First things first.
183,SAM,Gordon.
183,DEAN,"About that. When we find him, or if he finds us... Well I'm just saying he's not leaving us a whole lot of options."
183,DEAN,What?!
183,DEAN,You're a hundred miles away. How the hell did you—
183,BELA,Hello?  Purveyor of powerful occult objects?  I used a talking board to contact the other side.
183,DEAN,And?
183,BELA,"Warehouse. Two stories, riverfront, neon sign outside."
183,DEAN,Thanks.
183,BELA,"One more thing. The spirit had a message for you. ""Leave town, run like hell, and whatever you do, don't go after Gordon."" For whatever that's worth."
183,WOMAN,Please...  Help us. Please.
183,VAMPIRE,Go ahead. Do it. KILL me.
183,SAM,What happened here?
183,VAMPIRE,Gordon Walker. I never should have brought a hunter here. Never. I just... I just wanted some kind of revenge. Stupid... exposing him to my family.
183,DEAN,"Oh, yeah, you're such a family man."
183,DEAN,"I don't want to understand, you son of—"
183,VAMPIRE,I was desperate! You ever felt desperate? (shot of DEAN's face) I've lost everyone I ever loved. I'm staring down eternity alone.  (shot of DEAN's face) Can you think of a worse hell?
183,DEAN,"Well, there's Hell."
183,VAMPIRE,I wasn't thinking. I just ... I didn't care anymore. Do you know it's like when you just don't give a damn? It's like ... it's like being dead already. So just go ahead. (looks down at DEAN's knife) Do it.
183,GORDON,Not even close.
183,KUBRICK,I thought maybe you were dead. (GORDON scoffs.) What is it?
183,GORDON,Something ... happened.
183,KUBRICK,What?
183,GORDON,They turned me.
183,KUBRICK,'They' those fangs?  (pause)  I'm sorry. You know what this means.
183,KUBRICK,What do you mean?
183,GORDON,You have to let me do one last thing first
183,KUBRICK,What?
183,GORDON,Kill Sam Winchester.
183,KUBRICK,Gordon...
183,GORDON,"It's the only... it is the one good thing to come out of this nightmare.  I'm stronger, I'm faster – I can finish him."
183,KUBRICK,Gordon ... I'm sorry. You know I can't let you walk out of here.
183,GORDON,"Listen to me. There is nothing more important. Please. (pause, GORDON walks and faces the crucifix) I can do one last good thing for the world."
183,KUBRICK,"Yeah. I hear you. You know, Gordon, you're right. One last good thing."
183,DEAN,"Man, I must have checked three dozen motels, empty buildings, warehouses ..."
183,SAM,"Yeah, me too. Big city."
183,SAM,"Yeah, he'll be unstoppable. Hey, uh, give me your phone."
183,DEAN,What for?
183,DEAN,"Oh, yeah. (hands phone over) Thanks."
183,DEAN,"Sammy, stay here."
183,SAM,What? Where you going now?
183,SAM,What?
183,DEAN,You heard me.
183,SAM,"Not alone, you're not."
183,DEAN,"Sam, I don't need you to sign me a permission slip, okay? He's after you, not me, and he's turbocharged. I want you to stay out of harm's way. I'll take care of it."
183,SAM,"Well, Dean, you're not going by yourself.  You're gonna get yourself killed!"
183,DEAN,Just another day at the office. It's a massively dangerous day at the office (smirking)
183,SAM,"So you're the guy with nothing to lose now, huh? Oh wait, let me guess. Because, uh, it's because you're already dead, right?"
183,DEAN,If the shoe fits.
183,SAM,"You know what, man? I'm sick and tired of your kamikaze trip"
183,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, kamikaze? I'm more like a ninja."
183,SAM,That's not funny.
183,DEAN,It's a little funny.
183,SAM,No. It's not.
183,DEAN,"What do you want me to do, Sam, huh? Sit around all day writing sad poems about how I'm gonna die? You know what? I got one. Let's see, what rhymes with ""shut up, Sam""?"
183,SAM,"Dude, drop the attitude, Dean. Quit turning everything into a punch line. And you know something else? Stop trying to act like you're not afraid"
183,DEAN,I'm not!
183,SAM,You're lying. And you may as well drop it 'cause I can see right through you.
183,DEAN,You got no idea what you're talking about.
183,SAM,"Yeah, I do. You're scared, Dean. You're scared because your year is running out, and you're still going to Hell, and you're freaked."
183,DEAN,And how do you know that?
183,SAM,Because I know you!
183,DEAN,Really?
183,SAM,"Yeah, I've been following you around my entire life! I mean, I've been looking up to you since I was four, Dean. Studying you, trying to be just like my big brother. So yeah, I know you. Better than anyone else in the entire world. And this is exactly how you act when you're terrified. And, I mean, I can't blame you. It's just... (pause)"
183,DEAN,What?
183,SAM,I wish you would drop the show and be my brother again. 'Cause... (can't find words; tears in his eyes) just 'cause.
183,SAM,"You've had that phone two hours, Dean. Who'd you give the number to?"
183,GORDON,Dean.
183,DEAN,How'd you get this number?
183,GORDON,"Your scent's all over the cellphone store. Of course, I can't smell you now. Where are you?"
183,DEAN,"Well, I guess you'll just have to find us, won't you."
183,GORDON,I'd rather you come to me
183,DEAN,"What's the matter, Gordo? You're not afraid of us, are you? We're just sitting here. Bring it on!"
183,GORDON,I don't think so.
183,DEAN,"Gordon, let the girl go."
183,GORDON,"Bye, Dean."
183,DEAN,Gordon! Don't do this. You don't kill innocent people. You're still a hunter.
183,GORDON,No. I'm a monster.
183,DEAN,Sam!
183,SAM,Dean!
183,DEAN,"Damn it, Sam!"
183,SAM,Gordon!  You got me where you want me. You might as well come out and fight!
183,SAM,"So, this is really the way you want to do it, huh?"
183,GORDON,Damn right I do.
183,SAM,Look who's talking.
183,GORDON,You're right. I'm a bloodthirsty killer.
183,SAM,Don't talk about it like you don't have a choice.
183,GORDON,I don't.
183,SAM,"Yes you do, Gordon. You didn't kill that girl."
183,GORDON,"No, I didn't. I did something much, much worse."
183,GORDON,"I got to hand it to you, Sam. You got a lot of people fooled. But see, I know the truth. I know what it's like. We're the same now, you and me. I know how it is walking around with something evil inside you. It's just too bad you won't do the right thing and kill yourself. I'm gonna ... as soon as I'm done with you. Two last good deeds. Killing you, and killing myself."
183,SAM,No!
183,DEAN,"You just charged a super-vamped-out Gordon with no weapon. That's a little reckless, don't you think?"
183,SAM,Here you go.
183,DEAN,Thanks.
183,SAM,Figure out what's making that rattle?
183,DEAN,"Not yet. Give me a box wrench, would you?"
183,SAM,Yeah. There you go.
183,SAM,Wrong one?
183,DEAN,"No no no, come here for a second."
183,SAM,"Yeah, uh, valve cover covers the heads."
183,DEAN,Carburetor.
183,SAM,Yeah.
183,DEAN,Very good.
183,DEAN,"Yeah, I do. You fix it."
183,SAM,"Dean, you barely let me drive this thing."
183,DEAN,"Well, it's time. You should know how to fix it. You're gonna need to know these things for the future. (They look at each other.)  And besides, that's my job, right?  Show my little brother the ropes?"
183,DEAN,Put your shoulder into it.
185,PAUL,"She was so scared. I couldn't help; I couldn't do anything to stop it. And I've talked to the police, and I've talked to the medical examiner and no one can explain it."
185,DEAN,"Well, that's why they put the call in to us Mr. Dutton."
185,PAUL,"But the CDC, that's disease control, right? What do you think; it's some kind of virus?"
185,DEAN,Anyone that might have a reason to hurt her?
185,PAUL,"Wait, what are you saying? That somebody poisoned her?"
185,PAUL,"What?! No, no, there's just no one that could've—"
185,DEAN,Mr. Dutton?
185,PAUL,"Uh, everyone loved Janet."
185,DEAN,Okay. Thank you very much; I think we've got everything we need. We'll get out of your way now.
185,SAM,"No it could be anyone. Neighbor, coworker, man, woman—that's the problem, Dean, they're human, they're like everyone else."
185,DEAN,Great. How do we find 'em?
185,SAM,This wasn't random; someone in Janet Dutton's life had an ugly axe to grind. We find the motive—
185,DEAN,We find the murderer.
185,SAM,Yeah.
185,ELIZABETH,Amanda.
185,ELIZABETH,Hey Amanda!
185,AMANDA,"Oh, Elizabeth hi. Sorry, I've got like a thousand things on my mind."
185,ELIZABETH,Are you okay sweetie? You didn't come to book club last night.
185,AMANDA,"Yeah, sorry I was gonna call, I just—I got busy, you know? But I'm fine, really, I am."
185,PAUL,There's a woman—uh—
185,DEAN,"A woman, okay?"
185,DEAN,Paul! What is her name?
185,AMANDA,No! No...aah no!
185,SAM,Yeah.
185,DEAN,"Three per wrist, vertical. She wasn't foolin' around."
185,SAM,"Yeah, looks like she was working some heavyweight evil here."
185,DEAN,Yep.
185,DEAN,"Oh god! Freakin' witches! Seriously man, come on!"
185,SAM,Guess we know where she got the rabbit's teeth from.
185,DEAN,"Well, Paul sure knows how to pick 'em huh? It's like Fatal Attraction all over again."
185,SAM,Yeah.
185,DEAN,And why does the rabbit always get screwed in the deal?! The poor little guy.
185,SAM,"You know what I don't get, Dean? If she was so bent on revenge, why do this?"
185,DEAN,"Well, she got Janet Dutton, thought she finished off Paul, decided to cap herself and make it a spurned lover's hat-trick."
185,SAM,Maybe.
185,DEAN,"I mean, this doesn't exactly look like the TV room of a bright and stable person, you know?"
185,SAM,"No, but then..."
185,SAM,There's this.
185,DEAN,Another hex bag? Come on!
185,DEAN,"Looks like we got a hit, huh? A little witch-on-witch violence?"
185,SAM,I guess.
185,DEAN,"I'd like to report a dead body, 309 Mayfair Circle. My name? Yeah, sure my name is—"
185,DEAN,Why are witches ganking each other?
185,SAM,"I don't know, but I think maybe we got a coven on our hands."
185,RON,"All right, all right.  I'm going. I'm not fooled by your little book club by the way. I know what you ladies get up to when I'm gone. It's all dish and gossip."
185,ELIZABETH,Hi Ron.
185,ELIZABETH,He doesn't know? You didn't tell him?
185,RENEE,"About Amanda? Oh, I think that's book club business, don't you?"
185,RENEE,"Amanda killed herself yes. And yes, she killed Janet. (tsk-tsk clicks her teeth) Awful, awful business of course, but that's all over now. And think about what Book Club has gotten us hmm? Your husband's promotion, that little trip to Hawaii that you won. And what about me? My home pottery business is finally taking off and you wanna just stop? Do you wanna stop?"
185,RENEE,"'kay, now come on, we don't have much time, Ron gets back from his Fantasy Football in an hour."
185,SAM,You must have a green thumb.
185,SAM,"I'm uh, Detective Bachman, this is Detective Turner."
185,DEAN,Hi-ya.
185,SAM,"We're following up on Amanda Burns' death, going around the neighborhood and talking to neighbors and stuff like that."
185,ELIZABETH,But didn't she— I mean she killed herself right?
185,SAM,"Maybe, maybe."
185,DEAN,We heard you were friends with the deceased right?
185,ELIZABETH,"Yeah, I guess so."
185,DEAN,Did you have any idea about her practices?
185,ELIZABETH,"I'm sorry, what kind of practices?"
185,SAM,"Well see, her house was littered with Satanic paraphernalia."
185,DEAN,A regular Black Sabbath.
185,ELIZABETH,"No, the— but she was an Episcopalian."
185,DEAN,"Well, then we're pretty sure she was using the wrong Bible. (chuckles)"
185,RENEE,"Elizabeth, you all right?"
185,ELIZABETH,"I'm fine uh Renee, these are detectives. They say Amanda was— she was practicing—"
185,RENEE,I'm sorry detectives; you can tell that Elizabeth is a little bit upset.
185,DEAN,"Of course, Miss ... ?"
185,RENEE,"Missus.  Renee.  Van Allen. (She says it slowly and emphatically, like it's significant and she's important.) Would you like me to spell it for you?"
185,DEAN,"I'll get by, thanks."
185,RENEE,This Amanda business has been hard for Liz. For all of us.
185,TAMMI,"Yeah.  I mean, you think you know a person."
185,DEAN,"Well, I guess we all have secrets don't we?"
185,SAM,"Well, thanks, um, we'll be in touch."
185,DEAN,"Well, I'm already sold on that Elizabeth chick.  Did you see that victory garden of hers? Belladonna, wolfsbane, mandrake, not to mention that little flinch she threw when we mentioned the occult."
185,SAM,"Well, she's definitely had a good run lately, gone up a few tax brackets; won almost too many raffles. Kinda thing a little black magic always helps with."
185,DEAN,Yeah.
185,SAM,I don't think she's alone either.  Looks like 'MRS. Renee Van Allen' has won almost every craft contest she has entered in the past three months.
185,DEAN,"Yeah, a regular Martha Stewart, huh? Except for the devil worship, I'm thinking that was the coven we met back there, minus one member."
185,SAM,"Amanda was clearly going off the reservation. What do you think, they killed her to keep up appearances?"
185,DEAN,"Seems like an appearance kind of crowd, don't you think?"
185,SAM,Yeah.
185,DEAN,"If they killed the nut-job, should we uh, thank them or what?"
185,SAM,"They're working black magic too, Dean. They need to be stopped."
185,DEAN,'Stopped' like stopped?
185,DEAN,"They're human, Sam."
185,SAM,They're murderers.
185,DEAN,"Burn witch, burn."
185,DEAN,What the hell?
185,SAM,Ruby.
185,RUBY,"Sam, listen to me, there's no time."
185,SAM,For what? What are you talking about?
185,RUBY,You have to get out of town.
185,DEAN,"So this is Ruby, huh?"
185,DEAN,Never had the pleasure.
185,SAM,Dean!
185,DEAN,I was hoping you'd show up again.
185,RUBY,Point that thing somewhere else.
185,DEAN,Hahahaha! Right.
185,RUBY,"Sam, please. Go.  Get in the car and don't look back."
185,SAM,Why? I don't understand.
185,DEAN,"Hey, hot stuff, we can take care of a few kitchen witches, thanks."
185,RUBY,"I'm not talking about witches, you jackass.  Witches are whores. I'm talking about who they serve."
185,SAM,Demons.  They get their power from demons.
185,RUBY,"Yeah.  And there's one here, now."
185,DEAN,"Oh, what, you mean besides you?"
185,RUBY,"Sam, it knows you're in town and it's gonna come after you and its way more than you can handle."
185,DEAN,"Oh come on, what is this, huh? Please tell me you're not listening to this crap!"
185,RUBY,"Put a leash on your brother, Sam, if you wanna keep him."
185,SAM,"Dean, look, just chill out."
185,DEAN,"No! No! She's messing with your head, God knows why, that's who they are!"
185,RUBY,I'm telling you the truth.
185,DEAN,"And I'm telling you to shut up, bitch."
185,RUBY,"I'm sorry, why are you even a part of this conversation?!"
185,DEAN,"Oh, I don't know maybe because he's my brother, you black-eyed skank!"
185,RUBY,"Oh, right, right. You care about your brother so much.  That's why you're checking out in a few months, leaving him all alone?"
185,DEAN,Shut up.
185,RUBY,"At least let me try and save him, since you won't be here to do it any more."
185,DEAN,I said shut up!
185,SAM,Dean no!
185,DEAN,What the hell were you thinking?
185,DEAN,"She's a demon, Sam. Period.  All right? They want us dead, we want them dead."
185,SAM,"Oh, that's funny; I remember that demon chick in Ohio, Casey? You didn't want her dead."
185,DEAN,"Yeah, well she wasn't stringing me along like a fish on a hook."
185,SAM,Kill her with what? The gun she fixed for us?
185,DEAN,Whatever works.
185,SAM,"Dean, if she wants us dead, all she has to do is stop saving our lives."
185,SAM,"Look, we have to start looking at the big picture Dean, start thinking in strategies and – and moves ahead."
185,SAM,"It's not so simple, we're not – we're not just hunting anymore.  We're at war."
185,DEAN,Are you feeling okay?
185,SAM,(sigh) Why are you always asking me that?
185,DEAN,"Because you're taking advice from a demon, for starters. And by the way, you seem less and less worried about offing people.  You know, it used to eat you up inside."
185,SAM,"Yeah, and what has that gotten me?"
185,DEAN,"Nothing, but it's just what you're supposed to do, okay? We're supposed to drive in the freakin' car and freakin' argue about this stuff. You know, you go on about the sanctity of life and all that crap.  (DEAN rubs his stomach uncomfortably.)"
185,SAM,"Wait, so – so you're mad because I'm starting to agree with you?  (DEAN looks at SAM and exhales.)"
185,DEAN,"No, I'm not mad, I'm— I'm— I'm worried, Sam— (DEAN moves and sits down on the foot of the other bed in the room.)  I'm worried because you're not acting like yourself."
185,SAM,"Yeah, you're right, I'm not. I don't have a choice."
185,DEAN,What is that supposed to mean?
185,SAM,"Look, Dean, you're leaving – right? And I gotta stay here in this craphole of a world. Alone. So the way I see it, if I'm gonna make it, if I'm gonna fight this war after you're gone, then I gotta change."
185,DEAN,Change into what?
185,SAM,Into you. I gotta be more like you.
185,DEAN,Ah!
185,SAM,What's going on with you?
185,DEAN,"I don't know. (bends, gasps) Oh— Sam something's wrong— bunch of knives inside of me—"
185,SAM,Dean?
185,DEAN,Son of a bitch—
185,SAM,"Dean, hey."
185,DEAN,"The coven man, it's gotta be the coven."
185,SAM,Don't worry.
185,SAM,"Dean, I can't find it."
185,SAM,No.
185,DEAN,"Sam, what are you doing?"
185,DEAN,Sam!
185,DEAN,Sam!
185,SAM,Let him go.
185,RENEE,"Let who go? What are you doing? You're insane, get out!"
185,SAM,"Look, if you know about me, then you know about this gun. You're killing my brother.  Now let him go. Get away from the altar."
185,RENEE,What?
185,SAM,Now!
185,DEAN,You wanna kill me? Get in line bitch.
185,SAM,Go.
185,ELIZABETH,What— we— we weren't hurting anyone.
185,RENEE,"Please, we don't even know your brother."
185,SAM,"Stop the spell, or die.  Five seconds."
185,RENEE,What?
185,SAM,Four.
185,RENEE,"No, please, please don't kill us."
185,ELIZABETH,We were just getting Renee a lower mortgage rate!
185,RUBY,"Next time you point that gun at me, I'm not gonna just disappear, understand?"
185,DEAN,You ... saved my life.
185,RUBY,Don't mention it.
185,DEAN,"What was that stuff? God, it was ass.  It tasted like ass."
185,RUBY,"It's called witchcraft, short bus."
185,DEAN,You're the short bus ... short bus.
185,SAM,"Okay, maybe it's not you—"
185,SAM,—or you.
185,SAM,Maybe it's you.
185,TAMMI,I don't even know what he's talking about.  What a–re you even talking about?
185,SAM,"I mean, all of you, everyone in your little coven, you've all had runs of good fortune.  Newsworthy good fortune.  Except for you, Tammi. Now tell me, why is that? You didn't want anything for yourself? Or is it because you're already getting what you wanted – like these women's souls."
185,TAMMI,I can't- I-I'm not- I-I-I don't...
185,TAMMI,"Nice dick work, Magnum."
185,SAM,Let.  My brother.  Go.
185,TAMMI,"What's wrong?  Couldn't find my hex bag? Sorry, sweetheart, but your brother's lungs should be on the floor by now."
185,TAMMI,"You're in a lot of trouble, Sam."
185,ELIZABETH,"Tammi, what's wrong with your eyes?"
185,RENEE,"Tammi, what are you doing?"
185,TAMMI,"Renee, shut your painted hole."
185,RENEE,"What? I-I will— You can't— Not in my house, Tammi Fenton."
185,SAM,Look.  You got me – let the girl go.
185,TAMMI,"Wait your turn, young man."
185,TAMMI,"Shhh, Lizzie, it's okay."
185,ELIZABETH,You're not Tammi.
185,TAMMI,"No, but I'm wearing her meat. I had to break the ice with you girls somehow."
185,ELIZABETH,You killed Renee.
185,TAMMI,"Renee, Amanda ... That's what happens to witches who get voted off the island."
185,ELIZABETH,Who are you?
185,TAMMI,"Funny story, actually. You remember all those dark demonic forces you prayed to, when you swore your servitude? Just who did you think you were praying to?"
185,ELIZABETH,This-this isn't – it can't b—
185,TAMMI,"What did you think it was? Make-believe? Positive thinking? The Secret? No, it was me. You sold yourself to me, you pig."
185,TAMMI,"All I had to do was bring one good book to Book Club, and you ladies lined up to kiss my ass."
185,ELIZABETH,"No, no, we didn't know—"
185,TAMMI,"Oh, yes you did. You knew every step of the way, and now your ever livin' souls are mine."
185,TAMMI,"Comments? Questions? Hmm, Sammy Winchester, wow! Right here in our little town. You know, my friends and I, we've been looking for you."
185,SAM,"Why? Oh, right, 'cause I'm supposed to lead some piss poor demon army."
185,TAMMI,"Nothing personal, it's a P.R. thing, so, buh-bye."
185,TAMMI,Two for one.  Lovely.
185,RUBY,Wait.
185,TAMMI,"You made it out of the gate.  Impressive. That was a bitch of a fight, wasn't it?"
185,RUBY,Doors out of Hell only open for so long.
185,TAMMI,"What do you want, Ruby?"
185,RUBY,I've been lost without you. (she continues to advance) Take me back. That's why I led the Winchesters here.
185,TAMMI,Really.
185,TAMMI,You were one of my best.
185,TAMMI,"But then again, you always were a lying whore."
185,TAMMI,You're really telling me you threw in your chips with Abbott and Costello here?
185,TAMMI,Come on.  Get up.
185,TAMMI,"I said, get up!"
185,TAMMI,"We've been here before, haven't we?"
185,TAMMI,She didn't tell you?
185,TAMMI,"Didn't want your friends to know that all those centuries back, you sold yourself to me? Embarrassing, I guess. But don't worry love, no secrets where you're heading remember?"
185,TAMMI,"Monyé valack forsa, ulu iri regatt ruac, fieesh nieesh forthsa lé inmist infirum forthsa por un betest a té un fornalles ecclaisee –"
185,RUBY,Go.
185,RUBY,I'll clean up this mess.
185,DEAN,Come on.
185,RUBY,Go.
185,DEAN,"So the devil may care after all, is that what I'm supposed to believe?"
185,RUBY,I don't believe in the devil.
185,DEAN,"Wacky night. So let me get this straight, you were human once, you died, you went to hell, you became a..."
185,RUBY,Yeah.
185,DEAN,How long ago?
185,RUBY,Back when the plague was big.
185,DEAN,So all of 'em – every damn demon – they were all human once?
185,RUBY,Every one I've ever met.
185,DEAN,"Well, they sure don't act like it."
185,RUBY,"Most of them have forgotten what it means, or even that they were. That's what happens when you go to Hell, Dean. That's what Hell is – forgetting what you are."
185,DEAN,"Philosophy lesson from a demon.  I'll pass, thanks."
185,RUBY,It's not philosophy. It's not a metaphor. There's a real fire in the pit. Agonies you can't even imagine.
185,DEAN,"No, I saw ""Hellraiser"". I get the gist."
185,RUBY,"Actually, they got that pretty close.  Except for all the custom leather."
185,RUBY,"The answer is yes, by the way."
185,DEAN,I'm sorry?
185,RUBY,"Yes, the same thing will happen to you. It might take centuries, but sooner or later Hell will burn away your humanity. Every Hell-bound soul, every one, turns into something else. Turns you into us.  So yeah.  Yeah, you can count on it."
185,DEAN,"There's no way of saving me from the Pit, is there?"
185,RUBY,(sighs) No.
185,DEAN,Then why'd you tell Sam that you could?
185,RUBY,So he would talk to me. You Winchesters can be pretty bigoted. I needed something to help him get past the–
185,DEAN,The demon thing? It's pretty hard to get past.
185,RUBY,"(laughs) Look at you.  Tryin' to be all stoic. My god, it's heartbreaking."
185,DEAN,Why are you telling me all this?
185,RUBY,I need your help.
185,DEAN,Help with what?
185,RUBY,"With Sam. The way you stuck that demon tonight – it was pretty tough. Sam's almost there, but not quite.  You need to help me get him ready – for life without you. To fight this war on his own."
185,DEAN,Ruby!  (She pauses)  Why do you want us to win?
185,RUBY,"Isn't it obvious? I'm not like them.  I don't know why. I – I wish I was, but ... I'm not. I remember what it's like."
185,DEAN,What what's like?
185,RUBY,Being human.
186,MAID,Oh! I'm sorry.
186,MAID,Sir?
186,MAID,Wake up.
186,MAID,"Wake up, do you hear me? Wake up. Sir, wake up!"
186,MAID,Help! I need some help in here!
186,MAN,Cheers!
186,DEAN,There you are. What are you doing?
186,DEAN,It's two in the afternoon. You're drinking whiskey?
186,SAM,I drink whiskey all the time.
186,DEAN,"No, you don't."
186,SAM,"What's the big deal? You get sloppy in bars, you hit on chicks all the time. Why can't I?"
186,SAM,"I tried, Dean."
186,DEAN,To do what?
186,SAM,To save you.
186,SAM,"I'm serious, Dean."
186,DEAN,"No, you're drunk."
186,DEAN,What I've been telling you.
186,SAM,"No, that's not what I mean. I mean, no one can save you, because you don't wanna be saved. (pause) I mean, how can you care so little about yourself?"
186,SAM,"So, what's the diagnosis?"
186,DOCTOR,We've texted everything we can think to test. He seems perfectly healthy.
186,DEAN,Except that he's comatose.
186,DEAN,"No, he-he never gets sick. I mean, he doesn't even catch cold."
186,SAM,"Doctor, is there anything you can do?"
186,DOCTOR,"Look, I'm sorry, but we don't know what's causing it... so we don't know how to treat it. He just... went to sleep, and didn't wake up."
186,SAM,"So, what was Bobby doing in Pittsburgh?"
186,DEAN,Unless he's taking an extremely lame vacation...
186,SAM,"I mean, he must have been working a job, right?"
186,DEAN,"Well, you think there'd be some sort of sign of something, you know?"
186,DEAN,Or a frigging pizza box or a beer can.
186,SAM,How 'bout this?
186,SAM,You make heads or tails of any of this?
186,DEAN,"""Silene capensis"", which of course means absolutely nothing to me."
186,SAM,Here.  Obit.
186,SAM,"""Dr. Walter Gregg, 64, university neurologist."""
186,DEAN,How'd he bite it?
186,SAM,"Um.. actually, they don't know. They say he just went to sleep and didn't wake up."
186,DEAN,That sound familiar to you?
186,SAM,"All right, um... So let's say Bobby was looking into the doc's death. You know, hunting after something-"
186,DEAN,–that started hunting him.
186,SAM,Yeah.
186,DEAN,"All right, stay here. See if you can make heads or tails of this."
186,SAM,What are you gonna do?
186,DEAN,I'm gonna look into the good doctor myself.
186,DEAN,So you're Dr. Gregg's lab assistant?
186,SANDERS,That's right.
186,DEAN,"Well, his death must have come as a shock to you."
186,SANDERS,"Yeah, it did."
186,SANDERS,"But, still, go in your sleep, peaceful... That's what you wish for, right?"
186,DEAN,Yeah. Right.
186,DEAN,Dr. Gregg uh.. studied sleeping disorders?  Dreams?
186,SANDERS,I don't understand. I went over all of this with the other detective.
186,DEAN,You already spoke to another detective?
186,SANDERS,Yes. A very nice older man with a beard.
186,DEAN,"Well, I'd love to hear it again if you don't mind."
186,SANDERS,"Thing is, I'm sort of busy. Maybe we could do this later?"
186,SANDERS,"Look, okay, I didn't know about Dr. Gregg's experiments. Not until I was cleaning out his files."
186,SANDERS,"No one knew, okay? Not the university, not anybody. I already spoke with a lawyer and he told me I can't be held liable for anything."
186,DEAN,"Maybe you couldn't, but that was before the new evidence came to light."
186,SANDERS,New evidence?
186,DEAN,Mm-hm.
186,SANDERS,What new evidence?
186,DEAN,(thinks quickly) I'm not at liberty to say.
186,DEAN,"Maybe so. But, uh, still, this- this... this could go on your permanent record. Unless you hand over the doctor's research to me. All of it."
186,JEREMY,"Look, I don't know what the RA said, but, ah, I was growing ferns."
186,JEREMY,Really?
186,DEAN,I wanna talk to you about Dr. Gregg's sleep study.
186,JEREMY,"Yeah. Dr. Gregg just died, right?"
186,DEAN,"You were one of his test subjects, right?"
186,JEREMY,Yeah.
186,JEREMY,"Unless you're on ... duty or,  whatever?"
186,DEAN,I guess I can make an exception.
186,DEAN,"Now, Dr. Gregg was testing treatments for a, uh, ""Charcot-Wilbrand syndrome""? Which means...?"
186,JEREMY,"Um.. I, uh.. I can't dream."
186,JEREMY,I had this bike accident when I was a kid and banged my head pretty good and I haven't had a dream since. Till the study. You know. Sort of.
186,DEAN,What'd the doc give you?
186,JEREMY,"It's this yellow tea. It.. it smelled awful, tasted worse."
186,JEREMY,That was it. I dropped out of the study right after that. I didn't... like it. To tell you the truth... it kind of scared me.
186,SAM,How is he?
186,DEAN,No change. What you got?
186,DEAN,How so?
186,SAM,"This plant, Silene capensis, is also known as African Dream Root? It's been used by shaman and medicine men for centuries."
186,DEAN,"Let me guess. They dose up, bust out the didgeridoos, start kicking around the hackey."
186,SAM,"Not quite. If you believe the legends, it's used for dreamwalking. I mean, entering another person's dreams, poking around in their heads."
186,DEAN,I take it we believe the legends
186,SAM,When don't we? But dreamwalking is just the tip of the iceberg.
186,DEAN,What do you mean?
186,SAM,"I mean, this Dream Root is some serious mojo. You take enough of it, with practice, you can become a regular Freddy Krueger."
186,SAM,"You can control anything. You could turn bad dreams good, you could turn good dreams bad."
186,DEAN,And killing people in their sleep?
186,SAM,For example.
186,SAM,"So let's say uh, let's say this doc was testing this stuff on his patients, Tim Leary-style."
186,DEAN,"Somebody gets pissed at him, decides to give him a little dream visit, he goes nighty-night."
186,SAM,But what about Bobby?
186,SAM,"I mean, if the killer came after him, how come he's still alive?"
186,DEAN,I don't know.
186,BOBBY,HEEEELP MEEEEE!
186,DEAN,So how do we find our homicidal sandman?
186,SAM,Could be anyone.
186,DEAN,Yeah?
186,SAM,Yeah.
186,DEAN,"Anyone who knew the doctor, had access to his dream shrooms."
186,SAM,Maybe one of his test subjects or something?
186,DEAN,"Possible. But his research was pretty sketchy. I mean.. I don't know how many subjects he had, or who all of them were."
186,DEAN,What?
186,DEAN,You know what? You're right.
186,SAM,What?
186,DEAN,Let's go talk to him.
186,DEAN,Not if we're tripping on some Dream Root.
186,SAM,What?
186,DEAN,You heard me.
186,SAM,You wanna go dreamwalking inside Bobby's head?
186,DEAN,Yeah. Why not? Maybe we could help.
186,SAM,We have no idea what's crawling around in there.
186,DEAN,Well how bad could it be?
186,SAM,Bad.
186,DEAN,"Dude, it's Bobby."
186,DEAN,Crap.
186,SAM,What?
186,DEAN,Bela.
186,DEAN,"I'm feeling dirty just thinking about it, but yeah."
186,BELA,"Hey, Sam."
186,BELA,"Well, I'm full of surprises. Though, truthfully..."
186,BELA,You wanna know why I'm here?
186,SAM,Okay.
186,BELA,Because of you.
186,SAM,Uh.. What are you doing?
186,BELA,I can't stop thinking about you.
186,SAM,Are you sure?
186,BELA,Mmmm.... Sam. Sam. Sam. Oh!
186,DEAN,"Dude, you were out. And making some serious happy noises."
186,DEAN,Who were you dreaming about?
186,SAM,What? No one. Nothing.
186,DEAN,"C'mon, you can tell me. Angelina Jolie?"
186,SAM,No.
186,DEAN,Brad Pitt?
186,SAM,"No. No! Dude, it doesn't matter."
186,DEAN,Whatever.
186,DEAN,I called Bela.
186,DEAN,"Shockingly, no, which puts us back to square one. I've been trying to decipher the doctor's notes. Unfortunately, he has worse handwriting than you do."
186,SAM,"Yeah, yeah. Just give me a sec."
186,DEAN,Bela. As I live and breathe.
186,BELA,You called me. Remember?
186,DEAN,I remember you turning me down.
186,BELA,"Well, I'm just full of surprises."
186,SAM,"Hey, Bela. What's going on?"
186,BELA,I brought you your African Dream Root.
186,BELA,"Nasty stuff, and not easy to come by."
186,DEAN,Why the sudden change of heart?
186,BELA,What? I can't do you a little favor every now and again?
186,DEAN,No.  You can't.
186,DEAN,"Come on, I wanna know what the strings are before you attach them."
186,BELA,"You said this was for Bobby Singer, right?"
186,BELA,"Well, I'm doing it for him. Not you."
186,DEAN,Bobby? Why?
186,BELA,"I screwed up and he saved me, okay? You satisfied?"
186,DEAN,Maybe.
186,BELA,So when do we go on this little magical mystery tour?
186,DEAN,"Oh, you're not going anywhere. I don't trust you enough to let you in my car, much less Bobby's head. No offense."
186,BELA,None taken.
186,BELA,It's 2 am. Where am I supposed to go?
186,DEAN,"Get a room. Ah, they got the Magic Fingers, a little Casa Erotica on pay-per-view. You'll love it."
186,BELA,You...
186,SAM,Nice to see-.. Seeing you...
186,SAM,... Bela.
186,DEAN,"Uh, should we dim the lights and synch up Wizard of Oz to Dark Side of the Moon?"
186,SAM,Why?
186,DEAN,What did you do during college?
186,SAM,"Wait, wait, wait. Whew.  Can't forget this."
186,SAM,Here.
186,DEAN,What the hell is that?
186,SAM,That's how you control whose dream you're entering. You gotta ... drink some of their uh... some of their body.
186,DEAN,"Well, guess the hair of the dog is better than other parts of the body."
186,DEAN,Bottoms up.
186,DEAN,Feel anything?
186,SAM,No. You feel anything?
186,DEAN,Maybe we got some bad shwag.
186,SAM,"Hey, when did it start raining?"
186,DEAN,When did it start raining upside down?
186,SAM,"Wait. Wait a sec. Imagine the place, uh, without the paint job. (SAM begins gesturing to everything he's talking about.) More cluttered, dusty, books all over the place."
186,SAM,Yeah.
186,SAM,Dean?
186,SAM,I'm gonna go look outside.
186,SAM,"Dude, I'll be fine. Just, look around in here. Look, we gotta find him."
186,DEAN,Don't do anything stupid.
186,SAM,Dean!
186,SAM,Dean!
186,DEAN,Bobby?
186,DEAN,Bobby!
186,BOBBY,Dean?
186,DEAN,Yeah. It's me. Open up.
186,DEAN,Hey.
186,BOBBY,How in the hell did you find me?
186,DEAN,Sam and I got our hands on some of that Dream Root stuff.
186,BOBBY,Dream Root? What?
186,DEAN,"Dr. Gregg, the experiments?"
186,BOBBY,What the hell are you talking about?
186,BOBBY,Hurry.
186,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?"
186,BOBBY,She's coming.
186,DEAN,"Okay, you know this is a dream, don't you?"
186,DEAN,"It's a dream, Bobby! None of this is real!"
186,BOBBY,Does that look made-up?
186,DEAN,"Bobby, who is that?"
186,BOBBY,She's... She's my wife.
186,BOBBY,I'd rather died myself than hurt you.
186,DEAN,"Bobby, she's not real."
186,BOBBY,"You were possessed, baby. You were rabid. And I didn't know what I know now. I didn't know how to save you."
186,DEAN,Come on!
186,SAM,Who are you?
186,JEREMY,Who are you? You don't belong here.
186,SAM,You're one to talk. You're in my friend's head.
186,JEREMY,You got a poor choice in friends. This is self-defense. He came after me. He wanted to hurt me.
186,SAM,That may be because you're a killer.
186,JEREMY,You should be nicer to me. In here... you're just an insect. I'm a god.
186,DEAN,"Bobby! This is your dream.  And you can wake up. I mean, hell, you can do anything."
186,BOBBY,I'm dreaming?
186,DEAN,Yes! Now take control of it.
186,BOBBY,I don't believe it.
186,JEREMY,Sweet dreams.
186,DEAN,"Hey, Bobby. That, uh... That stuff, all that stuff with your wife?"
186,DEAN,That actually happen?
186,BOBBY,Everybody got into hunting somehow.
186,DEAN,I'm sorry.
186,SAM,"So, uh, stoner boy wasn't in his dorm. My guess is he's long gone by now."
186,BOBBY,He ain't much of a stoner.
186,DEAN,No?
186,BOBBY,"No. His name's Jeremy Frost. Full-on genius. Hundred-and-sixty IQ. Which is sayin' some, considering his dad took a baseball bat to his head."
186,BOBBY,Here's Father of the Year.
186,BOBBY,He died before Jeremy was 10.
186,SAM,Looks like a real sweetheart.
186,BOBBY,Injury gave him Charcot-Wilbrand.  He hasn't dreamt since.
186,DEAN,Till he started dosing the dream drug.
186,BOBBY,Yep.
186,DEAN,How'd he know how to dig up your worst nightmare and throw it at you?
186,BOBBY,"Hey, he was rooting around in my skull. God knows what he saw in there."
186,SAM,"Yeah. How'd he get in there in the first place? Isn't he supposed to have some of your hair, your DNA, or something?"
186,DEAN,Yeah.
186,BOBBY,"Yeahhhh. 'Fore I knew it was him, he offered me a beer. I drank it. (DEAN's face is showing a growing realization.) Dumbest frigging thing."
186,SAM,"Dean, you didn't."
186,DEAN,I was thirsty?
186,DEAN,"Well, now we just have to find him first."
186,BOBBY,We better work fast ...  and coffee up. Because the one thing we cannot do – is fall asleep.
186,SUBTITLE,Two Days Later
186,DEAN,"I mean, this Jeremy guy's not a friggin' ghost. Where the hell could he be?"
186,SAM,"Dean, you sure you don't want me to drive? You seem a little..."
186,SAM,... caffeinated.
186,DEAN,Tell me you got something!
186,BOBBY,"Strip club was a bust, huh?"
186,DEAN,Yeah.
186,BOBBY,That was our last lead.
186,DEAN,"What the hell, Bobby!"
186,BOBBY,"Don't yell at me, boy. I'm working my ass off here."
186,DEAN,"Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just.. I'm-I'm-I'm tired."
186,BOBBY,"Well, who ain't?"
186,DEAN,What's Bela got?
186,BOBBY,"What do you got, Bela?"
186,BELA,"Sorry. Sometimes the spirit world is in a chatty mood, and sometimes it isn't."
186,DEAN,"Great! Well, I'm just gonna go blow my brains out now!"
186,BOBBY,Let me ask you somethin'.
186,BELA,"Bobby, I'm surprised you don't remember."
186,BELA,Flagstaff?
186,BOBBY,Oh. Yeah. Right. Flagstaff.
186,DEAN,"All right, that's it. I'm done."
186,SAM,What are you doing?
186,DEAN,Taking myself a long-overdue nap.
186,SAM,"What?! Dean, Jeremy can come after you."
186,DEAN,That's the idea.
186,SAM,Excuse me?
186,DEAN,"Come on man, we can't find him, so let him come to me."
186,SAM,On his own turf? Where he's basically a god?
186,DEAN,I can handle it.
186,SAM,"Not alone, you can't."
186,DEAN,Ow!
186,DEAN,What are you doing?
186,DEAN,"No, you're not."
186,SAM,Why not? At least then it'll be two against one.
186,DEAN,'Cause I don't want you digging around in my head.
186,SAM,Too bad.
186,SAM,Dean.
186,DEAN,Jeez. (waking up) For the love of God.
186,>SAM,I have no idea.
186,SAM,There's someone out there.
186,LISA,Hey. You gonna sit down?
186,LISA,Come on. We only have an hour before we have to pick Ben up from baseball.
186,DEAN,I've never had this dream before.
186,SAM,Sorry.
186,LISA,Dean. I love you.
186,DEAN,Where'd she go?
186,SAM,Dean.
186,DEAN,Okay.
186,SAM,Dean?!
186,DEAN,Jeremy?
186,DEAN,"Well, aren't you a handsome son of a gun."
186,SAM,Dean.
186,SAM,Hey.
186,SAM,Wake up.
186,JEREMY,"Boy, you just don't know when to leave well enough alone, do you?"
186,JEREMY,You're wrong.
186,SAM,Yeah? Tell that to Dr. Gregg.
186,JEREMY,"The doc? No, no. The doc's the one that got me hooked on this stuff and then he took it away."
186,JEREMY,"But I needed it, and he wouldn't let me have it."
186,SAM,So you killed him?
186,JEREMY,"I can dream again. You know what that's like, not to be able to dream? You never rest, not really. It's like being awake for 15 years."
186,SAM,And let me guess. That makes you go crazy?
186,JEREMY,I just wanna be left alone. I just wanna dream.
186,SAM,Sorry. Can't do that.
186,JEREMY,That's the wrong answer.
186,JEREMY,I'm getting better and better at this. Stronger and stronger all the time.
186,JEREMY,But you and your brother? You're not waking up. Not this time. I'm not gonna let you.
186,DEAN,I mean it. I'm getting angry.
186,DEAN,"All that crap he dumped on me, about protecting Sam! That was his crap. He's the one who couldn't protect his family. He-"
186,DEAN,He's the one who let Mom die.
186,DEAN,– who wasn't there for Sam. I always was! He wasn't fair! I didn't deserve what he put on me.
186,DEAN,And I don't deserve to go to Hell!
186,JEREMY,You can't stop me. There's nothing I can't do in here.
186,JEREMY,That's right.
186,SAM,"Yeah? Well, you're forgetting something."
186,JEREMY,What's that?
186,SAM,I took the Dream Root too.
186,MAN,Jeremy!
186,HENRY,Jeremy!
186,JEREMY,No. No ....
186,JEREMY,Dad?
186,HENRY,"You answer me when I'm talking to you, boy."
186,JEREMY,No ....
186,BOBBY,"So you did a little dream-weaving of your own in here, huh?"
186,SAM,"Yeah. I just sort of concentrated and it happened, you know?"
186,BOBBY,"Didn't have anything to do with... you know, your psychic stuff?"
186,SAM,"No. I mean, I don't think so."
186,DEAN,"Hey, you guys seen Bela? She's not in her room. She's not answering her phone."
186,SAM,She must've taken off or something. <
186,DEAN,I thought you saved her life.
186,DEAN,The thing in Flagstaff.
186,BOBBY,"That thing in Flagstaff was an amulet. I gave her a good deal, that's all."
186,SAM,"Well, the why did y-?"
186,BOBBY,You boys better check your pockets.
186,BOBBY,Not literally.
186,SAM,The Colt.
186,SAM,Bela stole the Colt.
186,BOBBY,"Damn it, boys!"
186,DEAN,Pack you crap.
186,SAM,Why? Where are we going?
186,DEAN,We're gonna go hunt the bitch down.
186,DEAN,"Hey, Sam. I was wondering. When you were in my head, what did you see?"
186,DEAN,Nothing. I was looking for you the whole time.
186,DEAN,Sam.
186,SAM,Yeah?
186,DEAN,I don't wanna go to hell.
187,DEAN,"Rise and shine, Sammy!"
187,SAM,Dude. Asia?
187,DEAN,Come on. You love this song and you know it.
187,SAM,"Yeah, and if I ever hear it again I'm gonna kill myself."
187,DEAN,"What? Sorry, couldn't hear you. (SAM laughs)"
187,SAM,"Whenever you're ready, Dean."
187,DEAN,This yours?
187,DEAN,Bingo.
187,CASHIER,"Drive safely now, Mr. Pickett."
187,WAITRESS,"Can't stay unless you order something, Cal. You know the rules."
187,CAL,Some coffee.
187,DEAN,Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.
187,DEAN,"I'm telling you, Sam, this job is small fry. We should be spending our time hunting down Bela."
187,SAM,"Okay, sure, let's get right on that. Where is she again?"
187,DEAN,Shut up.
187,SAM,"Look.  Believe me, I want to find her as bad as you do. In the meantime, we have this."
187,DEAN,"All right, so this professor."
187,DEAN,Last known location?
187,SAM,His daughter says he was on his way to visit the Broward County Mystery Spot.
187,DEAN,Where the laws of physics have no meaning.
187,DORIS,"Two coffees, black, and some hot sauce for the—"
187,DORIS,Whoops. Crap! Sorry. (She turns to the back.) Cleanup!
187,DEAN,Find anything?
187,SAM,No.
187,DEAN,Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. Whoa. We can explain.
187,SAM,Dean!
187,SAM,Hey!
187,SAM,Call 911!
187,OWNER,I—I didn't mean to—
187,SAM,Now!
187,SAM,"Hey, hey, oh, no, no, no ...  not like this..."
187,SAM,Dean.
187,DEAN,"Rise and shine, Sammy!"
187,DEAN,Dude. Asia.
187,SAM,Dean.
187,DEAN,"Oh, come on, you love this song and you know it."
187,DEAN,What?
187,SAM,I don't know.
187,DEAN,You all right?
187,SAM,I think I—
187,SAM,"Man, I had a weird dream."
187,DEAN,Yeah? Clowns or midgets?
187,CASHIER,"Drive safely now, Mr. Pickett."
187,WAITRESS,"Can't stay unless you order something, Cal. You know the rules."
187,CAL,Coffee.
187,DEAN,Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.
187,SAM,It's Tuesday?
187,DEAN,Yeah.
187,DORIS,Are you boys ready?
187,DEAN,"Yes, I'll have the special, side of bacon and a coffee."
187,SAM,"Uh, nothing for me, thanks."
187,DORIS,Let me know if you change your mind.
187,DEAN,"I'm telling you, Sam, this job is small fry. We should be spending our time hunting down Bela."
187,DEAN,You with me?
187,SAM,What?
187,DEAN,You sure you feel okay?
187,SAM,You don't—you don't remember? Any of this?
187,DEAN,Remember what?
187,SAM,This. Today. Like it's—like it's ... happened before?
187,DEAN,You mean like déjà vu?
187,SAM,"No, I mean like, like it's really happened before."
187,DEAN,Yeah. Like déjà vu.
187,SAM,"No, forget about déjà vu. I'm asking you if it feels like, like we're living yesterday all over again."
187,DEAN,"Okay, how is that not dé—"
187,DORIS,"Coffee, black, and some hot sauce for the—oops! Crap!"
187,DORIS,Thanks.
187,DEAN,Nice reflexes.
187,DEAN,"Sam, I'm sorry, but I don't know what the hell you're talking about."
187,SAM,"Okay, look. Yesterday was Tuesday, right? But today is Tuesday too."
187,DEAN,Yeah. No. Good. You're totally balanced.
187,SAM,So you don't believe me?!
187,DEAN,"Look, I'm just saying that it's crazy, you know, I mean, even for us crazy. Dingo ate my baby crazy. Hey, maybe it was another of your psychic premonitions."
187,SAM,"No, no way, way too vivid. Okay, look, we were at the Mystery Spot, and then—"
187,DEAN,And then what?
187,SAM,Wait a minute! The Mystery Spot. You think maybe it—
187,DEAN,Maybe what?
187,DEAN,"All right, all right, we'll go tonight, after close, get ourselves a nice long look."
187,SAM,"Wait, what? No."
187,DEAN,Why not?
187,SAM,"Uhh (not wanting to say) – Let's just go now. Right now. Business hours, nice and crowded."
187,DEAN,"My God, you're a freak."
187,SAM,Dean.
187,DEAN,Okay! Whatever. We'll go now.
187,SAM,Dean!
187,SAM,"Dean, no, no, no."
187,SAM,Come on! Dean.
187,SAM,Hey. Dean.
187,SAM,Dean. Dean.
187,DEAN,"Rise and shine, Sammy!"
187,DEAN,Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.
187,SAM,"Okay, would you listen to me, Dean? 'Cause I am flipping out."
187,DORIS,Are you boys ready?
187,SAM,"He'll take the special, side of bacon, coffee, black. Nothing for me, thanks."
187,DORIS,You got it.
187,DEAN,"Sammy, I get all tingly when you take control like that."
187,SAM,"Quit screwing around, Dean."
187,DEAN,"Okay.  Okay.   I'm listening. So, so – you think that you're in some kind of a what again?"
187,SAM,Time loop.
187,DEAN,"Like ""Groundhog Day""."
187,SAM,"Yes, exactly. Like ""Groundhog Day""."
187,SAM,So you don't believe me.
187,SAM,Dingo ate my baby crazy?
187,DEAN,How'd you know I was going to say that?
187,SAM,"Because you said it before, Dean, that's my whole point."
187,DORIS,"Coffee, black, and some hot sauce for the—whoops! Crap."
187,DORIS,Thanks.
187,DEAN,Nice reflexes.
187,SAM,No. I knew it was going to happen.
187,SAM,"You're just going to have to go with me on this, Dean, you just have to, you owe me that much!"
187,DEAN,Calm down–
187,SAM,Don't tell me to calm down!  I can't calm down. I can't. Because—
187,DEAN,Because what?
187,SAM,"Because you die, today, Dean."
187,DEAN,I'm not gonna die. Not today.
187,SAM,"Twice now I've watched you die, and I can't— I won't do it again, okay? You're just going to have to believe me. Please."
187,DEAN,"All right. I still think you're nuts, but okay, whatever this is, we'll figure it out."
187,DEAN,And you think this cheesy-ass tourist trap has something to do with it?
187,SAM,"Maybe it's the real deal, you know? The, the magnetic fields bending spacetime or whatever."
187,DEAN,"I don't know, it all seems a little too ""X-Files"" for me."
187,SAM,"Well, I don't know how else to explain it, Dean!"
187,DEAN,"All right! All right. We'll go tonight after they close, get ourselves a nice long look."
187,SAM,"No no no no no, we can't."
187,DEAN,Why not?
187,SAM,"Because y–y–ou— (he stops, unable to finish)"
187,DEAN,I what?
187,DEAN,I die there?
187,SAM,"Blown away, actually."
187,DEAN,"Huh. Okay, let's go now."
187,DEAN,"Wait, did he –?"
187,SAM,Yesterday.  Yeah.
187,DEAN,And?
187,SAM,And what?
187,DEAN,"Did it look cool, like in the movies?"
187,OWNER,"Boys, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. We could use all the good ink we can get."
187,SAM,"How long have you owned the place, Mr. Carpiak?"
187,OWNER,"Well, my family's been guarding the secrets here since you don't want to know when."
187,SAM,So you'd know if anything strange happened.
187,OWNER,Strange? Strange happens here all the time. It's a Mystery Spot. (chuckles)
187,SAM,What exactly does that mean?
187,OWNER,"Well, uh ... it's where the laws of physics have no meaning."
187,DEAN,"The guy who went missing, Dexter Hasselback, he take the tour?"
187,OWNER,"Uh, uh, hold on a minute, what kind of article is this?"
187,SAM,Just answer the question.
187,OWNER,The police scoured every inch of this place. They couldn't find that man. I never seen him before. We're a family establishment—
187,SAM,Listen to me. There is something weird going on here. Now do you know anything about it or not?
187,OWNER,"Okay. Look. Guys. Um. Give me a break. I bought the joint at a foreclosure auction last March, all right? Hell, I used to sell bail bonds."
187,DEAN,"Okay, Kojak, let's get some air."
187,DEAN,"Well, I hate to say it, but that place is exactly what I thought - it's full of crap."
187,SAM,"Then what is it, Dean, what the hell is happening to us?"
187,DEAN,"I don't know. All right, let me just – So, every day I die."
187,SAM,Yeah.
187,DEAN,"And that's when you wake up again, right?"
187,SAM,Yeah.
187,DEAN,"So let's just make sure I don't die. If I make it to tomorrow, then maybe the loop stops and we can figure all this out."
187,SAM,You think?
187,DEAN,"It's worth a shot. I say we grab some takeout and head back to the motel, lay low until midnight."
187,DEAN,"All right, good. Who wants Chinese?"
187,DEAN,"Rise and shine, Sammy!"
187,DEAN,"I still think you're nuts, but ... whatever this is, we'll figure it out."
187,SAM,Thanks.
187,DEAN,"So, uh ... If you're stuck in ""Groundhog Day"", why? What's behind it?"
187,SAM,"Well, first I thought it was the Mystery Spot. Now I'm not so sure."
187,DEAN,What do we do?
187,SAM,"Well, we keep you breathing. Try to make it to tomorrow. I mean, that's the only thing I can think of."
187,DEAN,Shouldn't be too hard.
187,SAM,"Yeah, right.  Dean, I've watched you die a few times now and I can't ever seem to stop it."
187,DEAN,"Well, nothing's set in stone. You say I order the same thing every day, right?"
187,SAM,"Yeah. Pig in a poke, side of bacon."
187,DEAN,"'Scuse me, sweetheart?"
187,DEAN,Can I get sausage instead of bacon?
187,DORIS,"Sure thing, hon."
187,DEAN,"See? Different day already. You see, if you and I decide that I am not gonna die – I'm not gonna die."
187,DEAN,Thank you.
187,SAM,Dean. Dean?
187,DEAN,You mean we can't even go out for breakfast?
187,SAM,You'll thank me when it's Wednesday!
187,DEAN,Whatever that means.
187,DEAN,Do these tacos taste funny to you?
187,DEAN,"Maybe you should drop the axe and let this guy go, what do you say?"
187,SAM,Something's gotta be going on here. I intend to find out what.
187,DEAN,"Place is tore up pretty good, dude. Time to give it a rest."
187,SAM,NO! I'm gonna take it down to studs.
187,SAM,Dean?
187,CASHIER,"Drive safely now, Mr. Pickett."
187,WAITRESS,"Can't stay unless you order something, Cal. You know the rules."
187,CAL,Coffee.
187,DEAN,Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.
187,DEAN,What are those?
187,SAM,"The old man's. Trust me, you don't want him behind the wheel."
187,DORIS,You boys ready?
187,DEAN,"Uh, yes, we are. I'll have the special, side of bacon and a coffee."
187,SAM,"Hey, Doris? What I'd like is for you to log in some more hours at the archery range. You're a terrible shot."
187,DORIS,How'd you know that?
187,SAM,Lucky guess.
187,DEAN,"Okay, so you think you're caught in some kind of what, again?"
187,SAM,Time loop.
187,SAM,"Yeah, I am. You wanna know why? Because this is the hundredth Tuesday in a row I've been through, and it never stops. Ever. So yeah, I'm a little grumpy. Hot sauce."
187,DEAN,What?
187,DORIS,"Coffee, black, and some hot sauce for the—whoops! Crap!"
187,DORIS,Thanks.
187,DEAN,Nice reflexes.
187,SAM,"I knew it was going to happen, Dean. I know everything that's gonna happen."
187,SAM,Yeah.  I do.
187,SAM,It wasn't a guess.
187,DEAN,"Okay, enough!"
187,SAM,That's not all. Randy the cashier? He's skimming from the register. Judge Myers? At night he puts on a furry bunny outfit.
187,SAM,"Over there, that's Cal. He's gonna rob Tony the mechanic on the way home."
187,DEAN,What's your point?
187,SAM,"My point is I've lived through every possible Tuesday. I've watched you die every possible way. I have ripped apart the Mystery Spot, burnt it down, tried everything I know to save your life, and I can't. No matter what I do, you die. And then I wake up. And then it's Tuesday again."
187,SAM,Dog.
187,DEAN,There's gotta be some way out of this.
187,SAM,"""Where's my dang keys?"""
187,SAM,"""Excuse me."""
187,DEAN,She's kinda cute. (chuckles)
187,DEAN,"Hey. All the times we've walked down this street, I ever do this?"
187,DEAN,A hundred Tuesdays and you never bothered to check what she was holding in her hands?
187,DEAN,That's the guy who went missing?
187,SAM,Yeah?
187,DEAN,That's his daughter back there.
187,SAM,"Ma'am? Ah, Miss?"
187,SAM,"So the police report says Dexter Hasselback is a professor, but that's not all he is."
190,DEAN,Hello?
