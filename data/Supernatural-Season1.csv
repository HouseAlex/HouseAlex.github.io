1,JESS,We were supposed to be there like fifteen minutes ago.
1,JESS,Sam!

1,JESS,Yes!

1,JESS,So here's to Sam—
1,MUSIC,Baby
1,JESS,—and his awesome LSAT victory.
1,SAM,"All right, all right, it's not that big a deal."
1,JESS,"Yeah, he acts all humble."
1,JESS,But he scored a one seventy-four.
1,LUIS,Is that good?
1,JESS,Scary good.
1,LUIS,So there you go. You are a first-round draft pick. You can go to any law school you want!
1,SAM,"Actually, I got an interview here. Monday. If it goes okay I think I got a shot at a full ride next year."
1,JESS,Hey. It's gonna go great.
1,SAM,It better.
1,LUIS,How does it feel to be the golden boy of your family?
1,SAM,"Ah, they don't know."
1,LUIS,"Oh, no, I would be gloating! Why not?"
1,SAM,Because we're not exactly the Bradys.
1,LUIS,And I'm not exactly the Huxtables. More shots?
1,JESS and SAM,No. No.
1,SAM,No.
1,JESS,"No, seriously. I'm proud of you. And you're gonna knock 'em dead on Monday—"
1,JESS,—and you're gonna get that full ride. I know it.
1,SAM,What would I do without you?
1,JESS,Crash and burn.
1,MUSIC,Are you trying to get in
1,MUSIC,Are you gonna ride baby
1,MAN,"Whoa, easy, tiger."
1,SAM,Dean?
1,SAM,You scared the crap out of me!
1,DEAN,That's 'cause you're out of practice.
1,DEAN,Or not.
1,DEAN,Get off of me.
1,SAM,What the hell are you doing here?
1,DEAN,"Well, I was looking for a beer."
1,SAM,What the hell are you doing here?
1,DEAN,Okay. All right. We gotta talk.
1,SAM,"Uh, the phone?"
1,DEAN,"If I'd'a called, would you have picked up?"
1,JESS,Sam?
1,SAM,"Jess. Hey. Dean, this is my girlfriend, Jessica."
1,JESS,"Wait, your brother Dean?"
1,DEAN,"Oh, I love the Smurfs. You know, I gotta tell you. You are completely out of my brother's league."
1,JESS,Just let me put something on.
1,DEAN,"No, no, no, I wouldn't dream of it. Seriously."
1,DEAN,"Anyway, I gotta borrow your boyfriend here, talk about some private family business."
1,DEAN,"But, uh, nice meeting you."
1,SAM,No.
1,SAM,"No, whatever you want to say, you can say it in front of her."
1,DEAN,Okay.
1,DEAN,Um. Dad hasn't been home in a few days.
1,SAM,So he's working overtime on a Miller Time shift. He'll stumble back in sooner or later.
1,DEAN,Dad's on a hunting trip. And he hasn't been home in a few days.
1,SAM,"Jess, excuse us. We have to go outside."
1,SAM,"I mean, come on. You can't just break in, middle of the night, and expect me to hit the road with you."
1,DEAN,"You're not hearing me, Sammy. Dad's missing. I need you to help me find him."
1,SAM,"You remember the poltergeist in Amherst? Or the Devil's Gates in Clifton? He was missing then, too. He's always missing, and he's always fine."
1,DEAN,Not for this long. Now are you gonna come with me or not?
1,SAM,I'm not.
1,DEAN,Why not?
1,SAM,I swore I was done hunting. For good.
1,DEAN,"Come on. It wasn't easy, but it wasn't that bad."
1,SAM,"Yeah? When I told Dad I was scared of the thing in my closet, he gave me a .45."
1,DEAN,"Well, what was he supposed to do?"
1,SAM,"I was nine years old! He was supposed to say, don't be afraid of the dark."
1,DEAN,Don't be afraid of the dark? Are you kidding me? Of course you should be afraid of the dark. You know what's out there.
1,SAM,"Yeah, I know, but still. The way we grew up, after Mom was killed, and Dad's obsession to find the thing that killed her."
1,SAM,But we still haven't found the damn thing. So we kill everything we
1,DEAN,"We save a lot of people doing it, too."
1,SAM,You think Mom would have wanted this for us?
1,SAM,"The weapon training, and melting the silver into bullets? Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors."
1,DEAN,"So what are you gonna do? You're just gonna live some normal, apple pie life? Is that it?"
1,SAM,No. Not normal. Safe.
1,DEAN,And that's why you ran away.
1,SAM,I was just going to college. It was Dad who said if I was gonna go I should stay gone. And that's what I'm doing.
1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, Dad's in real trouble right now. If he's not dead already. I can feel it."
1,DEAN,I can't do this alone.
1,SAM,Yes you can.
1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, I don't want to."
1,SAM,What was he hunting?
1,DEAN,"All right, let's see, where the hell did I put that thing?"
1,SAM,"So when Dad left, why didn't you go with him?"
1,DEAN,"I was working my own gig. This, uh, voodoo thing, down in New Orleans."
1,SAM,Dad let you go on a hunting trip by yourself?
1,DEAN,"I'm twenty-six, dude."
1,DEAN,"All right, here we go. So Dad was checking out this two-lane blacktop just outside of Jericho, California. About a month ago, this guy."
1,DEAN,"They found his car, but he vanished. Completely MIA."
1,SAM,So maybe he was kidnapped.
1,DEAN,"Yeah. Well, here's another one in April."
1,DEAN,"Another one in December 'oh-four, 'oh-three, 'ninety-eight, 'ninety-two, ten of them over the past twenty years."
1,DEAN,"All men, all the same five-mile stretch of road."
1,DEAN,"It started happening more and more, so Dad went to go dig around. That was about three weeks ago. I hadn't heard from him since, which is bad enough."
1,DEAN,Then I get this voicemail yesterday.
1,JOHN,"Dean...something big is starting to happen...I need to try and figure out what's going on. It may... Be very careful, Dean. We're all in danger."
1,SAM,You know there's EVP on that?
1,DEAN,"Not bad, Sammy. Kinda like riding a bike, isn't it?"
1,DEAN,"All right. I slowed the message down, I ran it through a gold wave, took out the hiss, and this is what I got."
1,WOMAN,I can never go home...
1,SAM,Never go home.
1,DEAN,"You know, in almost two years I've never bothered you, never asked you for a thing."
1,SAM,All right. I'll go. I'll help you find him.
1,SAM,But I have to get back first thing Monday. Just wait here.
1,DEAN,What's first thing Monday?
1,SAM,I have this...I have an interview.
1,DEAN,"What, a job interview? Skip it."
1,SAM,"It's a law school interview, and it's my whole future on a plate."
1,DEAN,Law school?
1,SAM,So we got a deal or not?
1,JESS,"Wait, you're taking off?"
1,JESS,Is this about your dad? Is he all right?
1,SAM,"Yeah. You know, just a little family drama."
1,JESS,Your brother said he was on some kind of hunting trip.
1,SAM,"Oh, yeah, he's just deer hunting up at the cabin, he's probably got Jim, Jack, and José along with him. I'm just going to go bring him back."
1,JESS,What about the interview?
1,SAM,I'll make the interview. This is only for a couple days.
1,JESS,"Sam, I mean, please."
1,JESS,Just stop for a second. You sure you're okay?
1,SAM,I'm fine.
1,JESS,"It's just...you won't even talk about your family. And now you're taking off in the middle of the night to spend a weekend with them? And with Monday coming up, which is kind of a huge deal."
1,SAM,"Hey. Everything's going to be okay. I will be back in time, I promise."
1,JESS,At least tell me where you're going.
1,TROY,"Amy, I can't come over tonight. Because I've got work in the morning, that's why. ...Yeah, okay, I miss it and my dad's gonna have my ass."
1,TROY,"Hey, ah, Amy, let me call you back?"
1,MUSIC,I got this feeling and it's deep in my bah-tay
1,MUSIC,If I should touch you
1,TROY,Car trouble or something?
1,WOMAN,Take me home?
1,TROY,"Sure, get in."
1,TROY,"So, where do you live?"
1,WOMAN,At the end of Breckenridge Road.
1,TROY,You coming from a Halloween party or something?
1,TROY,"You know, a girl like you really shouldn't be alone out here."
1,WOMAN,I'm with you.
1,WOMAN,Do you think I'm pretty?
1,TROY,Uh...huh.
1,WOMAN,Will you come home with me?
1,TROY,Um. Hell yeah.
1,TROY,Come on. You don't live here.
1,WOMAN,I can never go home.
1,TROY,What are you talking about? Nobody even lives here. Where do you live?
1,TROY,"That's good. Joke's over, okay? You want me to leave?"
1,TROY,Hello? Hello?
1,MUSIC,"Lord, I was born a ramblin' man"
1,MUSIC,Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
1,DEAN,Hey!
1,DEAN,You want breakfast?
1,SAM,"No, thanks."
1,MUSIC,And when it's time for leavin'
1,SAM,So how'd you pay for that stuff?
1,MUSIC,I hope you'll understand
1,SAM,You and Dad still running credit card scams?
1,MUSIC,That I was born a ramblin' man
1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, hunting ain't exactly a pro ball career."
1,DEAN,"Besides, all we do is apply. It's not our fault they send us the cards."
1,SAM,Yeah? And what names did you write on the application this time?
1,DEAN,"Uh, Burt Aframian."
1,DEAN,And his son Hector. Scored two cards out of the deal.
1,SAM,"That sounds about right. I swear, man, you've gotta update your cassette tape collection."
1,DEAN,Why?
1,SAM,"Well, for one, they're cassette tapes. And two."
1,SAM,Black Sabbath? Motorhead? Metallica?
1,SAM,It's the greatest hits of mullet rock.
1,DEAN,"Well, house rules, Sammy."
1,DEAN,"Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cakehole."
1,SAM,"You know, Sammy is a chubby twelve-year-old."
1,SAM,"It's Sam, okay?"
1,DEAN,"Sorry, I can't hear you, the music's too loud."
1,MUSIC,Back in black
1,MUSIC,From the noose
1,SAM,Thank you.
1,MUSIC,Lookin' at the sky
1,SAM,"All right. So, there's no one matching Dad at the hospital or morgue."
1,MUSIC,Forget the hearse 'cause I'll never die
1,SAM,"So that's something, I guess."
1,MUSIC,I got nine lives
1,DEAN,Check it out.
1,MUSIC,'Cause I'm back
1,DEAN,Let's go.
1,JAFFE,You guys find anything?
1,MAN,No! Nothing!
1,HEIN,"No sign of struggle, no footprints, no fingerprints. Spotless. It's almost too clean."
1,JAFFE,"So, this kid Troy. He's dating your daughter, isn't he?"
1,HEIN,Yeah.
1,JAFFE,How's Amy doing?
1,HEIN,She's putting up missing posters downtown.
1,DEAN,"You fellas had another one like this just last month, didn't you?"
1,JAFFE,And who are you?
1,DEAN,Federal marshals.
1,JAFFE,"You two are a little young for marshals, aren't you?"
1,DEAN,"Thanks, that's awfully kind of you."
1,DEAN,"You did have another one just like this, correct?"
1,JAFFE,"Yeah, that's right. About a mile up the road. There've been others before that."
1,SAM,"So, this victim, you knew him?"
1,JAFFE,"Town like this, everybody knows everybody."
1,DEAN,"Any connection between the victims, besides that they're all men?"
1,JAFFE,No. Not so far as we can tell.
1,SAM,So what's the theory?
1,JAFFE,"Honestly, we don't know. Serial murder? Kidnapping ring?"
1,DEAN,"Well, that is exactly the kind of crack police work I'd expect out of you guys."
1,SAM,Thank you for your time.
1,SAM,Gentlemen.
1,SAM,Ow! What was that for?
1,DEAN,Why'd you have to step on my foot?
1,SAM,Why do you have to talk to the police like that?
1,DEAN,"Come on. They don't really know what's going on. We're all alone on this. I mean, if we're going to find Dad we've got to get to the bottom of this thing ourselves."
1,SHERIFF,Can I help you boys?
1,DEAN,"No, sir, we were just leaving."
1,DEAN,Agent Mulder. Agent Scully.
1,EMERGENCY TOWN HALL MEETING,SUNDAY 8 PM
1,DEAN,I'll bet you that's her.
1,SAM,Yeah.
1,DEAN,You must be Amy.
1,AMY,Yeah.
1,DEAN,"Yeah, Troy told us about you. We're his uncles. I'm Dean, this is Sammy."
1,AMY,He never mentioned you to me.
1,DEAN,"Well, that's Troy, I guess. We're not around much, we're up in Modesto."
1,SAM,"So, we're looking for him too, and we're kinda asking around."
1,RACHEL,"Hey, are you okay?"
1,AMY,Yeah.
1,SAM,You mind if we ask you a couple questions?
1,AMY,"I was on the phone with Troy. He was driving home. He said he would call me right back, and...he never did."
1,SAM,"He didn't say anything strange, or out of the ordinary?"
1,AMY,No. Nothing I can remember.
1,SAM,I like your necklace.
1,AMY,Troy gave it to me. Mostly to scare my parents—
1,AMY,—with all that devil stuff.
1,SAM,"Actually, it means just the opposite. A pentagram is protection against evil. Really powerful. I mean, if you believe in that kind of thing."
1,DEAN,"Okay. Thank you, Unsolved Mysteries."
1,DEAN,"Here's the deal, ladies. The way Troy disappeared, something's not right. So if you've heard anything..."
1,DEAN,What is it?
1,RACHEL,"Well, it's just... I mean, with all these guys going missing, people talk."
1,DEAN and SAM,What do they talk about?
1,RACHEL,"It's kind of this local legend. This one girl? She got murdered out on Centennial, like decades ago."
1,RACHEL,"Well, supposedly she's still out there."
1,RACHEL,"She hitchhikes, and whoever picks her up? Well, they disappear forever."
1,SAM,Let me try.
1,DEAN,I got it.
1,DEAN,Dude!
1,DEAN,You're such a control freak.
1,SAM,"So angry spirits are born out of violent death, right?"
1,DEAN,Yeah.
1,SAM,"Well, maybe it's not murder."
1,SAM,"This was 1981. Constance Welch, twenty-four years old, jumps off Sylvania Bridge, drowns in the river."
1,DEAN,Does it say why she did it?
1,SAM,Yeah.
1,DEAN,What?
1,SAM,"An hour before they found her, she calls 911. Apparently her two little kids are in the bathtub. She leaves them alone for a minute, and when she comes back, they aren't breathing. Both die."
1,DEAN,Hm.
1,SAM,"""'Our babies were gone, and Constance just couldn't bear it,' said husband Joseph Welch."""
1,DEAN,The bridge look familiar to you?
1,DEAN,So this is where Constance took the swan dive.
1,SAM,So you think Dad would have been here?
1,DEAN,"Well, he's chasing the same story and we're chasing him."
1,SAM,"Okay, so now what?"
1,DEAN,Now we keep digging until we find him. Might take a while.
1,SAM,"Dean, I told you, I've gotta get back by Monday—"
1,DEAN,Monday. Right. The interview.
1,SAM,Yeah.
1,DEAN,"Yeah, I forgot. You're really serious about this, aren't you? You think you're just going to become some lawyer? Marry your girl?"
1,SAM,Maybe. Why not?
1,DEAN,"Does Jessica know the truth about you? I mean, does she know about the things you've done?"
1,SAM,"No, and she's not ever going to know."
1,DEAN,"Well, that's healthy. You can pretend all you want, Sammy. But sooner or later you're going to have to face up to who you really are."
1,SAM,And who's that?
1,DEAN,You're one of us.
1,SAM,No. I'm not like you. This is not going to be my life.
1,DEAN,You have a responsibility to—
1,SAM,"To Dad? And his crusade? If it weren't for pictures I wouldn't even know what Mom looks like. And what difference would it make? Even if we do find the thing that killed her, Mom's gone. And she isn't coming back."
1,DEAN,Don't talk about her like that.
1,DEAN,Sam.
1,DEAN,Where'd she go?
1,SAM,I don't know.
1,DEAN,What the—
1,SAM,Who's driving your car?
1,SAM,Dean? Go! Go!
1,SAM,Dean? Dean!
1,DEAN,What?
1,SAM,Hey! Are you all right?
1,DEAN,I'm super.
1,SAM,Your car all right?
1,DEAN,"Yeah, whatever she did to it, seems all right now. That Constance chick, what a"
1,SAM,"Well, she doesn't want us digging around, that's for sure. So where's the job go from here, genius?"
1,SAM,You smell like a toilet.
1,DEAN,"One room, please."
1,CLERK,You guys having a reunion or something?
1,SAM,What do you mean?
1,CLERK,"I had another guy, Burt Aframian. He came and bought out a room for the whole month."
1,SAM,Whoa.
1,DEAN,I don't think he's been here for a couple days at least.
1,SAM,"Salt, cats-eye shells...he was worried. Trying to keep something from coming in."
1,SAM,What have you got here?
1,DEAN,Centennial Highway victims.
1,DEAN,"I don't get it. I mean, different men, different jobs—"
1,DEAN,"—ages, ethnicities. There's always a connection, right? What do these guys have in common?"
1,SAM,Dad figured it out.
1,DEAN,What do you mean?
1,SAM,He found the same article we did. Constance Welch. She's a woman in white.
1,DEAN,You sly dogs.
1,DEAN,"All right, so if we're dealing with a woman in white, Dad would have found the corpse and destroyed it."
1,SAM,She might have another weakness.
1,DEAN,"Well, Dad would want to make sure."
1,DEAN,He'd dig her up. Does it say where she's buried?
1,SAM,"No, not that I can tell. If I were Dad, though, I'd go ask her husband."
1,SAM,If he's still alive.
1,DEAN,"All right. Why don't you, uh, see if you can find an address, I'm gonna get cleaned up."
1,SAM,"Hey, Dean?"
1,SAM,"What I said earlier, about Mom and Dad, I'm sorry."
1,DEAN,No chick-flick moments.
1,SAM,All right. Jerk.
1,DEAN,Bitch.
1,JESS,"Hey, it's me, it's about ten-twenty Saturday night—"
1,DEAN,"Hey, man. I'm starving, I'm gonna grab a little something to eat in that diner down the street. You want anything?"
1,SAM,No.
1,DEAN,Aframian's buying.
1,SAM,Mm-mm.
1,JESS,"So come home soon, okay? I love you."
1,SAM,What?
1,DEAN,"Dude, five-oh, take off."
1,SAM,What about you?
1,DEAN,"Uh, they kinda spotted me. Go find Dad."
1,DEAN,"Problem, officers?"
1,JAFFE,Where's your partner?
1,DEAN,"Partner? What, what partner?"
1,JAFFE,So. Fake US Marshal. Fake credit cards. You got anything that's real?
1,DEAN,My boobs.
1,JAFFE,You have the right to remain silent—
1,SHERIFF,So you want to give us your real name?
1,DEAN,"I told you, it's Nugent. Ted Nugent."
1,SHERIFF,I'm not sure you realize just how much trouble you're in here.
1,DEAN,"We talkin', like, misdemeanor kind of trouble or, uh, squeal like a pig trouble?"
1,SHERIFF,You got the faces of ten missing persons taped to your wall.
1,SHERIFF,"Along with a whole lot of Satanic mumbo-jumbo. Boy, you are officially a suspect."
1,DEAN,That makes sense. Because when the first one went missing in '82 I was three.
1,SHERIFF,I know you've got partners. One of 'em's an older guy. Maybe he started the whole thing. So tell me. Dean.
1,SHERIFF,This his?
1,SHERIFF,"I thought that might be your name. See, I leafed through this. What little I could make out—I mean, it's nine kinds of crazy."
1,SHERIFF,"But I found this, too."
1,SHERIFF,Now. You're stayin' right here till you tell me exactly what the hell that means.
1,SAM,Hi. Are you Joseph Welch?
1,JOSEPH,Yeah.
1,JOSEPH,"Yeah, he was older, but that's him."
1,JOSEPH,He came by three or four days ago. Said he was a reporter.
1,SAM,That's right. We're working on a story together.
1,JOSEPH,"Well, I don't know what the hell kinda story you're working on. The questions he asked me?"
1,SAM,About your wife Constance?
1,JOSEPH,He asked me where she was buried.
1,SAM,And where is that again?
1,JOSEPH,"What, I gotta go through this twice?"
1,SAM,It's fact-checking. If you don't mind.
1,JOSEPH,In a plot. Behind my old place over on Breckenridge.
1,SAM,And why did you move?
1,JOSEPH,I'm not gonna live in the house where my children died.
1,SAM,"Mr. Welch, did you ever marry again?"
1,JOSEPH,"No way. Constance, she was the love of my life. Prettiest woman I ever known."
1,SAM,So you had a happy marriage?
1,JOSEPH,Definitely.
1,SAM,"Well, that should do it. Thanks for your time."
1,SAM,"Mr. Welch, did you ever hear of a woman in white?"
1,JOSEPH,A what?
1,SAM,A woman in white. Or sometimes weeping woman?
1,SAM,"It's a ghost story. Well, it's more of a phenomenon, really."
1,SAM,"Um, they're spirits. They've been sighted for hundreds of years, dozens of places, in Hawaii, Mexico, lately in Arizona, Indiana. All these are different women."
1,SAM,You understand. But all share the same story.
1,JOSEPH,"Boy, I don't care much for nonsense."
1,SAM,"See, when they were alive, their husbands were unfaithful to them."
1,SAM,"And these women, basically suffering from temporary insanity, murdered their children."
1,SAM,"Then once they realized what they had done, they took their own lives. So now their spirits are cursed, walking back roads, waterways. And if they find an unfaithful man, they kill him. And that man is never seen again."
1,JOSEPH,You think...you think that has something to do with...Constance? You smartass!
1,SAM,You tell me.
1,JOSEPH,"I mean, maybe...maybe I made some mistakes. But no matter what I did, Constance, she never would have killed her own children. Now, you get the hell out of here! And you don't come back!"
1,DEAN,I don't know how many times I gotta tell you. It's my high school locker combo.
1,SHERIFF,We gonna do this all night long?
1,DEPUTY,"We just got a 911, shots fired over at Whiteford Road."
1,SHERIFF,You have to go to the bathroom?
1,DEAN,No.
1,SHERIFF,Good.
1,DEAN,"Fake 911 phone call? Sammy, I don't know, that's pretty illegal."
1,SAM,You're welcome.
1,DEAN,"Listen, we gotta talk."
1,SAM,Tell me about it. So the husband
1,DEAN,"Sammy, would you shut up for a second?"
1,SAM,I just can't figure out why Dad hasn't destroyed the corpse yet.
1,DEAN,"Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you. He's gone. Dad left Jericho."
1,SAM,What? How do you know?
1,DEAN,I've got his journal.
1,SAM,He doesn't go anywhere without that thing.
1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, he did this time."
1,SAM,What's it say?
1,DEAN,"Ah, the same old ex-Marine crap, when he wants to let us know where he's going."
1,SAM,Coordinates. Where to?
1,DEAN,I'm not sure yet.
1,SAM,"I don't understand. I mean, what could be so important that Dad would just skip out in the middle of a job? Dean, what the hell is going on?"
1,DEAN,Sam? Sam!
1,CONSTANCE,Take me home.
1,CONSTANCE,Take me home!
1,SAM,No.
1,SAM,Don't do this.
1,CONSTANCE,I can never go home.
1,SAM,You're scared to go home.
1,CONSTANCE,Hold me. I'm so cold.
1,SAM,You can't kill me. I'm not unfaithful. I've never been!
1,CONSTANCE,You will be. Just hold me.
1,SAM,I'm taking you home.
1,DEAN,Sam! Sam! You okay?
1,SAM,I think...
1,DEAN,Can you move?
1,SAM,Yeah. Help me?
1,DEAN,There you go.
1,CHILDREN,"You've come home to us, Mommy."
1,DEAN,So this is where she drowned her kids.
1,SAM,That's why she could never go home. She was too scared to face them.
1,DEAN,"You found her weak spot. Nice work, Sammy."
1,SAM,"Yeah, I wish I could say the same for you. What were you thinking shooting Casper in the face, you freak?"
1,DEAN,Hey. Saved your ass.
1,DEAN,I'll tell you another thing. If you screwed up my car?
1,DEAN,I'll kill you.
1,MUSIC,"Living easy, loving free"
1,MUSIC,Asking nothing
1,SAM,"Okay, here's where Dad went."
1,MUSIC,Leave me be
1,SAM,"It's called Blackwater Ridge, Colorado."
1,MUSIC,Taking everythin' in my stride
1,DEAN,Sounds charming. How far?
1,MUSIC,Don't need reason
1,SAM,About six hundred miles.
1,MUSIC,Don't need rhyme
1,DEAN,"Hey, if we shag ass we could make it by morning."
1,MUSIC,Ain't nothing I would rather do
1,SAM,"Dean, I, um..."
1,MUSIC,Going down
1,MUSIC,Party time
1,DEAN,You're not going.
1,MUSIC,My friends are gonna be there too
1,SAM,"The interview's in like, ten hours. I gotta be there."
1,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, whatever."
1,DEAN,I'll take you home.
1,MUSIC,Highway to hell
1,MUSIC,I'm on the highway to hell
1,SAM,Call me if you find him?
1,SAM,"And maybe I can meet up with you later, huh?"
1,DEAN,"Yeah, all right."
1,DEAN,Sam?
1,DEAN,"You know, we made a hell of a team back there."
1,SAM,Yeah.
1,SAM,Jess?
1,SAM,You home?
1,SAM,No!
1,DEAN,Sam!
1,SAM,Jess!
1,DEAN,Sam! Sam!
1,SAM,No! No!
1,SAM,Jess! Jess! No!
1,SAM,We got work to do.
1,LUIS,Ha!
1,LUIS,"What do you think, huh?"
1,SAM,Whatever.
1,LUIS,"At least I wore a costume. Man, if your sorry ass was trick-or-treating at my house, there would be no popcorn balls for you."
1,SAM,You gave out popcorn balls?
1,LUIS,"You could at least have gone as a slutty version of something. Slutty Dorothy, slutty Alice, slutty nurse—"
1,JESS,Hey.
1,LUIS,I—I didn't mean you.
1,SAM,"Man, what can I say? I just never been a big fan of the whole thing."
1,LUIS,"Never been a fan—what, what, are you a Communist? Who doesn't like Halloween?"
1,SAM,Jess?
1,SAM,You home?
1,SAM,No!
1,DEAN,Hey. How you doing?
1,SAM,I'm fine.
1,SAM,Come on. We got work to do.
