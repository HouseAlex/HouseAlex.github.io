1,MARY,"Come on, let's say good night to your brother."
1,DEAN,"'Night, Sam."
1,MARY,"Good night, love."
1,MAN,"Hey, Dean."
1,DEAN,Daddy!
1,JOHN,"Hey, buddy."
1,JOHN,So what do you think? You think Sammy's ready to toss around a football yet?
1,DEAN,"No, Daddy."
1,JOHN,No.
1,MARY,You got him?
1,JOHN,I got him.
1,JOHN,"Sweet dreams, Sam."
1,MARY,John?
1,MARY,John? Is he hungry?
1,MAN,Shhh.
1,MARY,All right.
1,MARY,Hm.
1,MARY,Sammy! Sammy!
1,JOHN,Mary?
1,JOHN,Mary!
1,JOHN,Mary.
1,JOHN,"Hey, Sammy. You okay?"
1,JOHN,No! Mary!
1,DEAN,Daddy!
1,JOHN,"Take your brother outside as fast as you can and don't look back! Now, Dean, go!"
1,JOHN,Mary!
1,JOHN,No!
1,DEAN,"It's okay, Sammy."
1,JOHN,I gotcha.
1,FIREFIGHTER,I got it. You go hold the line up.
1,OFFICER,Stay back. You have to stay back.
1,JESS,"Get a move on, would you?"
1,JESS,We were supposed to be there like fifteen minutes ago.
1,JESS,Sam!
1,JESS,You coming or what?
1,SAM,Do I have to?
1,JESS,Yes!
1,JESS,It'll be fun.
1,JESS,And where's your costume?
1,SAM,You know how I feel about Halloween.
1,JESS,So here's to Sam—
1,JESS,—and his awesome LSAT victory.
1,SAM,"All right, all right, it's not that big a deal."
1,JESS,"Yeah, he acts all humble."
1,JESS,But he scored a one seventy-four.
1,LUIS,Is that good?
1,JESS,Scary good.
1,LUIS,So there you go. You are a first-round draft pick. You can go to any law school you want!
1,SAM,"Actually, I got an interview here. Monday. If it goes okay I think I got a shot at a full ride next year."
1,JESS,Hey. It's gonna go great.
1,SAM,It better.
1,LUIS,How does it feel to be the golden boy of your family?
1,SAM,"Ah, they don't know."
1,LUIS,"Oh, no, I would be gloating! Why not?"
1,SAM,Because we're not exactly the Bradys.
1,LUIS,And I'm not exactly the Huxtables. More shots?
1,SAM,No.
1,JESS,"No, seriously. I'm proud of you. And you're gonna knock 'em dead on Monday—"
1,JESS,—and you're gonna get that full ride. I know it.
1,SAM,What would I do without you?
1,JESS,Crash and burn.
1,MAN,"Whoa, easy, tiger."
1,SAM,Dean?
1,SAM,You scared the crap out of me!
1,DEAN,That's 'cause you're out of practice.
1,DEAN,Or not.
1,DEAN,Get off of me.
1,SAM,What the hell are you doing here?
1,DEAN,"Well, I was looking for a beer."
1,SAM,What the hell are you doing here?
1,DEAN,Okay. All right. We gotta talk.
1,SAM,"Uh, the phone?"
1,DEAN,"If I'd'a called, would you have picked up?"
1,JESS,Sam?
1,SAM,"Jess. Hey. Dean, this is my girlfriend, Jessica."
1,JESS,"Wait, your brother Dean?"
1,DEAN,"Oh, I love the Smurfs. You know, I gotta tell you. You are completely out of my brother's league."
1,JESS,Just let me put something on.
1,DEAN,"No, no, no, I wouldn't dream of it. Seriously."
1,DEAN,"Anyway, I gotta borrow your boyfriend here, talk about some private family business."
1,DEAN,"But, uh, nice meeting you."
1,SAM,No.
1,SAM,"No, whatever you want to say, you can say it in front of her."
1,DEAN,Okay.
1,DEAN,Um. Dad hasn't been home in a few days.
1,SAM,So he's working overtime on a Miller Time shift. He'll stumble back in sooner or later.
1,DEAN,Dad's on a hunting trip. And he hasn't been home in a few days.
1,SAM,"Jess, excuse us. We have to go outside."
1,SAM,"I mean, come on. You can't just break in, middle of the night, and expect me to hit the road with you."
1,DEAN,"You're not hearing me, Sammy. Dad's missing. I need you to help me find him."
1,SAM,"You remember the poltergeist in Amherst? Or the Devil's Gates in Clifton? He was missing then, too. He's always missing, and he's always fine."
1,DEAN,Not for this long. Now are you gonna come with me or not?
1,SAM,I'm not.
1,DEAN,Why not?
1,SAM,I swore I was done hunting. For good.
1,DEAN,"Come on. It wasn't easy, but it wasn't that bad."
1,SAM,"Yeah? When I told Dad I was scared of the thing in my closet, he gave me a .45."
1,DEAN,"Well, what was he supposed to do?"
1,SAM,"I was nine years old! He was supposed to say, don't be afraid of the dark."
1,DEAN,Don't be afraid of the dark? Are you kidding me? Of course you should be afraid of the dark. You know what's out there.
1,SAM,"Yeah, I know, but still. The way we grew up, after Mom was killed, and Dad's obsession to find the thing that killed her."
1,DEAN,"We save a lot of people doing it, too."
1,SAM,You think Mom would have wanted this for us?
1,SAM,"The weapon training, and melting the silver into bullets? Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors."
1,DEAN,"So what are you gonna do? You're just gonna live some normal, apple pie life? Is that it?"
1,SAM,No. Not normal. Safe.
1,DEAN,And that's why you ran away.
1,SAM,I was just going to college. It was Dad who said if I was gonna go I should stay gone. And that's what I'm doing.
1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, Dad's in real trouble right now. If he's not dead already. I can feel it."
1,DEAN,I can't do this alone.
1,SAM,Yes you can.
1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, I don't want to."
1,SAM,What was he hunting?
1,DEAN,"All right, let's see, where the hell did I put that thing?"
1,SAM,"So when Dad left, why didn't you go with him?"
1,DEAN,"I was working my own gig. This, uh, voodoo thing, down in New Orleans."
1,SAM,Dad let you go on a hunting trip by yourself?
1,DEAN,"I'm twenty-six, dude."
1,DEAN,"All right, here we go. So Dad was checking out this two-lane blacktop just outside of Jericho, California. About a month ago, this guy."
1,DEAN,"They found his car, but he vanished. Completely MIA."
1,SAM,So maybe he was kidnapped.
1,DEAN,"Yeah. Well, here's another one in April."
1,DEAN,"Another one in December 'oh-four, 'oh-three, 'ninety-eight, 'ninety-two, ten of them over the past twenty years."
1,DEAN,"All men, all the same five-mile stretch of road."
1,DEAN,"It started happening more and more, so Dad went to go dig around. That was about three weeks ago. I hadn't heard from him since, which is bad enough."
1,DEAN,Then I get this voicemail yesterday.
1,JOHN,"Dean...something big is starting to happen...I need to try and figure out what's going on. It may... Be very careful, Dean. We're all in danger."
1,SAM,You know there's EVP on that?
1,DEAN,"Not bad, Sammy. Kinda like riding a bike, isn't it?"
1,DEAN,"All right. I slowed the message down, I ran it through a gold wave, took out the hiss, and this is what I got."
1,WOMAN,I can never go home...
1,SAM,Never go home.
1,DEAN,"You know, in almost two years I've never bothered you, never asked you for a thing."
1,SAM,All right. I'll go. I'll help you find him.
1,SAM,But I have to get back first thing Monday. Just wait here.
1,DEAN,What's first thing Monday?
1,SAM,I have this...I have an interview.
1,DEAN,"What, a job interview? Skip it."
1,SAM,"It's a law school interview, and it's my whole future on a plate."
1,DEAN,Law school?
1,SAM,So we got a deal or not?
1,JESS,"Wait, you're taking off?"
1,JESS,Is this about your dad? Is he all right?
1,SAM,"Yeah. You know, just a little family drama."
1,JESS,Your brother said he was on some kind of hunting trip.
1,SAM,"Oh, yeah, he's just deer hunting up at the cabin, he's probably got Jim, Jack, and José along with him. I'm just going to go bring him back."
1,JESS,What about the interview?
1,SAM,I'll make the interview. This is only for a couple days.
1,JESS,"Sam, I mean, please."
1,JESS,Just stop for a second. You sure you're okay?
1,SAM,I'm fine.
1,JESS,"It's just...you won't even talk about your family. And now you're taking off in the middle of the night to spend a weekend with them? And with Monday coming up, which is kind of a huge deal."
1,SAM,"Hey. Everything's going to be okay. I will be back in time, I promise."
1,JESS,At least tell me where you're going.
1,TROY,"Amy, I can't come over tonight. Because I've got work in the morning, that's why. ...Yeah, okay, I miss it and my dad's gonna have my ass."
1,TROY,"Hey, ah, Amy, let me call you back?"
1,TROY,Car trouble or something?
1,WOMAN,Take me home?
1,TROY,"Sure, get in."
1,TROY,"So, where do you live?"
1,WOMAN,At the end of Breckenridge Road.
1,TROY,You coming from a Halloween party or something?
1,TROY,"You know, a girl like you really shouldn't be alone out here."
1,WOMAN,I'm with you.
1,WOMAN,Do you think I'm pretty?
1,TROY,Uh...huh.
1,WOMAN,Will you come home with me?
1,TROY,Um. Hell yeah.
1,TROY,Come on. You don't live here.
1,WOMAN,I can never go home.
1,TROY,What are you talking about? Nobody even lives here. Where do you live?
1,TROY,"That's good. Joke's over, okay? You want me to leave?"
1,TROY,Hello? Hello?
1,DEAN,Hey!
1,DEAN,You want breakfast?
1,SAM,"No, thanks."
1,SAM,So how'd you pay for that stuff?
1,SAM,You and Dad still running credit card scams?
1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, hunting ain't exactly a pro ball career."
1,DEAN,"Besides, all we do is apply. It's not our fault they send us the cards."
1,SAM,Yeah? And what names did you write on the application this time?
1,DEAN,"Uh, Burt Aframian."
1,DEAN,And his son Hector. Scored two cards out of the deal.
1,SAM,"That sounds about right. I swear, man, you've gotta update your cassette tape collection."
1,DEAN,Why?
1,SAM,"Well, for one, they're cassette tapes. And two."
1,SAM,Black Sabbath? Motorhead? Metallica?
1,SAM,It's the greatest hits of mullet rock.
1,DEAN,"Well, house rules, Sammy."
1,DEAN,"Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cakehole."
1,SAM,"You know, Sammy is a chubby twelve-year-old."
1,SAM,"It's Sam, okay?"
1,DEAN,"Sorry, I can't hear you, the music's too loud."
1,SAM,Thank you.
1,SAM,"All right. So, there's no one matching Dad at the hospital or morgue."
1,SAM,"So that's something, I guess."
1,DEAN,Check it out.
1,DEAN,Let's go.
1,JAFFE,You guys find anything?
1,MAN,No! Nothing!
1,HEIN,"No sign of struggle, no footprints, no fingerprints. Spotless. It's almost too clean."
1,JAFFE,"So, this kid Troy. He's dating your daughter, isn't he?"
1,HEIN,Yeah.
1,JAFFE,How's Amy doing?
1,HEIN,She's putting up missing posters downtown.
1,DEAN,"You fellas had another one like this just last month, didn't you?"
1,JAFFE,And who are you?
1,DEAN,Federal marshals.
1,JAFFE,"You two are a little young for marshals, aren't you?"
1,DEAN,"Thanks, that's awfully kind of you."
1,DEAN,"You did have another one just like this, correct?"
1,JAFFE,"Yeah, that's right. About a mile up the road. There've been others before that."
1,SAM,"So, this victim, you knew him?"
1,JAFFE,"Town like this, everybody knows everybody."
1,DEAN,"Any connection between the victims, besides that they're all men?"
1,JAFFE,No. Not so far as we can tell.
1,SAM,So what's the theory?
1,JAFFE,"Honestly, we don't know. Serial murder? Kidnapping ring?"
1,DEAN,"Well, that is exactly the kind of crack police work I'd expect out of you guys."
1,SAM,Thank you for your time.
1,SAM,Gentlemen.
1,SAM,Ow! What was that for?
1,DEAN,Why'd you have to step on my foot?
1,SAM,Why do you have to talk to the police like that?
1,DEAN,"Come on. They don't really know what's going on. We're all alone on this. I mean, if we're going to find Dad we've got to get to the bottom of this thing ourselves."
1,SHERIFF,Can I help you boys?
1,DEAN,"No, sir, we were just leaving."
1,DEAN,Agent Mulder. Agent Scully.
1,DEAN,I'll bet you that's her.
1,SAM,Yeah.
1,DEAN,You must be Amy.
1,AMY,Yeah.
1,DEAN,"Yeah, Troy told us about you. We're his uncles. I'm Dean, this is Sammy."
1,AMY,He never mentioned you to me.
1,DEAN,"Well, that's Troy, I guess. We're not around much, we're up in Modesto."
1,SAM,"So, we're looking for him too, and we're kinda asking around."
1,RACHEL,"Hey, are you okay?"
1,AMY,Yeah.
1,SAM,You mind if we ask you a couple questions?
1,AMY,"I was on the phone with Troy. He was driving home. He said he would call me right back, and...he never did."
1,SAM,"He didn't say anything strange, or out of the ordinary?"
1,AMY,No. Nothing I can remember.
1,SAM,I like your necklace.
1,AMY,Troy gave it to me. Mostly to scare my parents—
1,AMY,—with all that devil stuff.
1,SAM,"Actually, it means just the opposite. A pentagram is protection against evil. Really powerful. I mean, if you believe in that kind of thing."
1,DEAN,"Okay. Thank you, Unsolved Mysteries."
1,DEAN,"Here's the deal, ladies. The way Troy disappeared, something's not right. So if you've heard anything..."
1,DEAN,What is it?
1,RACHEL,"Well, it's just... I mean, with all these guys going missing, people talk."
1,RACHEL,"It's kind of this local legend. This one girl? She got murdered out on Centennial, like decades ago."
1,RACHEL,"Well, supposedly she's still out there."
1,RACHEL,"She hitchhikes, and whoever picks her up? Well, they disappear forever."
1,SAM,Let me try.
1,DEAN,I got it.
1,DEAN,Dude!
1,DEAN,You're such a control freak.
1,SAM,"So angry spirits are born out of violent death, right?"
1,DEAN,Yeah.
1,SAM,"Well, maybe it's not murder."
1,SAM,"This was 1981. Constance Welch, twenty-four years old, jumps off Sylvania Bridge, drowns in the river."
1,DEAN,Does it say why she did it?
1,SAM,Yeah.
1,DEAN,What?
1,SAM,"An hour before they found her, she calls 911. Apparently her two little kids are in the bathtub. She leaves them alone for a minute, and when she comes back, they aren't breathing. Both die."
1,DEAN,Hm.
1,SAM,"""'Our babies were gone, and Constance just couldn't bear it,' said husband Joseph Welch."""
1,DEAN,The bridge look familiar to you?
1,DEAN,So this is where Constance took the swan dive.
1,SAM,So you think Dad would have been here?
1,DEAN,"Well, he's chasing the same story and we're chasing him."
1,SAM,"Okay, so now what?"
1,DEAN,Now we keep digging until we find him. Might take a while.
1,SAM,"Dean, I told you, I've gotta get back by Monday—"
1,DEAN,Monday. Right. The interview.
1,SAM,Yeah.
1,DEAN,"Yeah, I forgot. You're really serious about this, aren't you? You think you're just going to become some lawyer? Marry your girl?"
1,SAM,Maybe. Why not?
1,DEAN,"Does Jessica know the truth about you? I mean, does she know about the things you've done?"
1,SAM,"No, and she's not ever going to know."
1,DEAN,"Well, that's healthy. You can pretend all you want, Sammy. But sooner or later you're going to have to face up to who you really are."
1,SAM,And who's that?
1,DEAN,You're one of us.
1,SAM,No. I'm not like you. This is not going to be my life.
1,DEAN,You have a responsibility to—
1,SAM,"To Dad? And his crusade? If it weren't for pictures I wouldn't even know what Mom looks like. And what difference would it make? Even if we do find the thing that killed her, Mom's gone. And she isn't coming back."
1,DEAN,Don't talk about her like that.
1,DEAN,Sam.
1,DEAN,Where'd she go?
1,SAM,I don't know.
1,DEAN,What the—
1,SAM,Who's driving your car?
1,SAM,Dean? Go! Go!
1,SAM,Dean? Dean!
1,DEAN,What?
1,SAM,Hey! Are you all right?
1,DEAN,I'm super.
1,SAM,Your car all right?
1,SAM,"Well, she doesn't want us digging around, that's for sure. So where's the job go from here, genius?"
1,SAM,You smell like a toilet.
1,DEAN,"One room, please."
1,CLERK,You guys having a reunion or something?
1,SAM,What do you mean?
1,CLERK,"I had another guy, Burt Aframian. He came and bought out a room for the whole month."
1,SAM,Whoa.
1,DEAN,I don't think he's been here for a couple days at least.
1,SAM,"Salt, cats-eye shells...he was worried. Trying to keep something from coming in."
1,SAM,What have you got here?
1,DEAN,Centennial Highway victims.
1,DEAN,"I don't get it. I mean, different men, different jobs—"
1,DEAN,"—ages, ethnicities. There's always a connection, right? What do these guys have in common?"
1,SAM,Dad figured it out.
1,DEAN,What do you mean?
1,SAM,He found the same article we did. Constance Welch. She's a woman in white.
1,DEAN,You sly dogs.
1,DEAN,"All right, so if we're dealing with a woman in white, Dad would have found the corpse and destroyed it."
1,SAM,She might have another weakness.
1,DEAN,"Well, Dad would want to make sure."
1,DEAN,He'd dig her up. Does it say where she's buried?
1,SAM,"No, not that I can tell. If I were Dad, though, I'd go ask her husband."
1,SAM,If he's still alive.
1,DEAN,"All right. Why don't you, uh, see if you can find an address, I'm gonna get cleaned up."
1,SAM,"Hey, Dean?"
1,SAM,"What I said earlier, about Mom and Dad, I'm sorry."
1,DEAN,No chick-flick moments.
1,SAM,All right. Jerk.
1,DEAN,Bitch.
1,JESS,"Hey, it's me, it's about ten-twenty Saturday night—"
1,DEAN,"Hey, man. I'm starving, I'm gonna grab a little something to eat in that diner down the street. You want anything?"
1,SAM,No.
1,DEAN,Aframian's buying.
1,SAM,Mm-mm.
1,JESS,"So come home soon, okay? I love you."
1,SAM,What?
1,DEAN,"Dude, five-oh, take off."
1,SAM,What about you?
1,DEAN,"Uh, they kinda spotted me. Go find Dad."
1,DEAN,"Problem, officers?"
1,JAFFE,Where's your partner?
1,DEAN,"Partner? What, what partner?"
1,JAFFE,So. Fake US Marshal. Fake credit cards. You got anything that's real?
1,DEAN,My boobs.
1,JAFFE,You have the right to remain silent—
1,SHERIFF,So you want to give us your real name?
1,DEAN,"I told you, it's Nugent. Ted Nugent."
1,SHERIFF,I'm not sure you realize just how much trouble you're in here.
1,DEAN,"We talkin', like, misdemeanor kind of trouble or, uh, squeal like a pig trouble?"
1,SHERIFF,You got the faces of ten missing persons taped to your wall.
1,SHERIFF,"Along with a whole lot of Satanic mumbo-jumbo. Boy, you are officially a suspect."
1,DEAN,That makes sense. Because when the first one went missing in '82 I was three.
1,SHERIFF,I know you've got partners. One of 'em's an older guy. Maybe he started the whole thing. So tell me. Dean.
1,SHERIFF,This his?
1,SHERIFF,"I thought that might be your name. See, I leafed through this. What little I could make out—I mean, it's nine kinds of crazy."
1,SHERIFF,"But I found this, too."
1,SHERIFF,Now. You're stayin' right here till you tell me exactly what the hell that means.
1,SAM,Hi. Are you Joseph Welch?
1,JOSEPH,Yeah.
1,JOSEPH,"Yeah, he was older, but that's him."
1,JOSEPH,He came by three or four days ago. Said he was a reporter.
1,SAM,That's right. We're working on a story together.
1,JOSEPH,"Well, I don't know what the hell kinda story you're working on. The questions he asked me?"
1,SAM,About your wife Constance?
1,JOSEPH,He asked me where she was buried.
1,SAM,And where is that again?
1,JOSEPH,"What, I gotta go through this twice?"
1,SAM,It's fact-checking. If you don't mind.
1,JOSEPH,In a plot. Behind my old place over on Breckenridge.
1,SAM,And why did you move?
1,JOSEPH,I'm not gonna live in the house where my children died.
1,SAM,"Mr. Welch, did you ever marry again?"
1,JOSEPH,"No way. Constance, she was the love of my life. Prettiest woman I ever known."
1,SAM,So you had a happy marriage?
1,JOSEPH,Definitely.
1,SAM,"Well, that should do it. Thanks for your time."
1,SAM,"Mr. Welch, did you ever hear of a woman in white?"
1,JOSEPH,A what?
1,SAM,A woman in white. Or sometimes weeping woman?
1,SAM,"It's a ghost story. Well, it's more of a phenomenon, really."
1,SAM,"Um, they're spirits. They've been sighted for hundreds of years, dozens of places, in Hawaii, Mexico, lately in Arizona, Indiana. All these are different women."
1,SAM,You understand. But all share the same story.
1,JOSEPH,"Boy, I don't care much for nonsense."
1,SAM,"See, when they were alive, their husbands were unfaithful to them."
1,SAM,"And these women, basically suffering from temporary insanity, murdered their children."
1,SAM,"Then once they realized what they had done, they took their own lives. So now their spirits are cursed, walking back roads, waterways. And if they find an unfaithful man, they kill him. And that man is never seen again."
1,JOSEPH,You think...you think that has something to do with...Constance? You smartass!
1,SAM,You tell me.
1,JOSEPH,"I mean, maybe...maybe I made some mistakes. But no matter what I did, Constance, she never would have killed her own children. Now, you get the hell out of here! And you don't come back!"
1,DEAN,I don't know how many times I gotta tell you. It's my high school locker combo.
1,SHERIFF,We gonna do this all night long?
1,DEPUTY,"We just got a 911, shots fired over at Whiteford Road."
1,SHERIFF,You have to go to the bathroom?
1,DEAN,No.
1,SHERIFF,Good.
1,DEAN,"Fake 911 phone call? Sammy, I don't know, that's pretty illegal."
1,SAM,You're welcome.
1,DEAN,"Listen, we gotta talk."
1,DEAN,"Sammy, would you shut up for a second?"
1,SAM,I just can't figure out why Dad hasn't destroyed the corpse yet.
1,DEAN,"Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you. He's gone. Dad left Jericho."
1,SAM,What? How do you know?
1,DEAN,I've got his journal.
1,SAM,He doesn't go anywhere without that thing.
1,DEAN,"Yeah, well, he did this time."
1,SAM,What's it say?
1,DEAN,"Ah, the same old ex-Marine crap, when he wants to let us know where he's going."
1,SAM,Coordinates. Where to?
1,DEAN,I'm not sure yet.
1,SAM,"I don't understand. I mean, what could be so important that Dad would just skip out in the middle of a job? Dean, what the hell is going on?"
1,DEAN,Sam? Sam!
1,CONSTANCE,Take me home.
1,CONSTANCE,Take me home!
1,SAM,No.
1,SAM,Don't do this.
1,CONSTANCE,I can never go home.
1,SAM,You're scared to go home.
1,CONSTANCE,Hold me. I'm so cold.
1,SAM,You can't kill me. I'm not unfaithful. I've never been!
1,CONSTANCE,You will be. Just hold me.
1,SAM,I'm taking you home.
1,DEAN,Sam! Sam! You okay?
1,SAM,I think...
1,DEAN,Can you move?
1,SAM,Yeah. Help me?
1,DEAN,There you go.
1,CHILDREN,"You've come home to us, Mommy."
1,DEAN,So this is where she drowned her kids.
1,SAM,That's why she could never go home. She was too scared to face them.
1,DEAN,"You found her weak spot. Nice work, Sammy."
1,SAM,"Yeah, I wish I could say the same for you. What were you thinking shooting Casper in the face, you freak?"
1,DEAN,Hey. Saved your ass.
1,DEAN,I'll tell you another thing. If you screwed up my car?
1,DEAN,I'll kill you.
1,SAM,"Okay, here's where Dad went."
1,SAM,"It's called Blackwater Ridge, Colorado."
1,DEAN,Sounds charming. How far?
1,SAM,About six hundred miles.
1,DEAN,"Hey, if we shag ass we could make it by morning."
1,SAM,"Dean, I, um..."
1,DEAN,You're not going.
1,SAM,"The interview's in like, ten hours. I gotta be there."
1,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, whatever."
1,DEAN,I'll take you home.
1,SAM,Call me if you find him?
1,SAM,"And maybe I can meet up with you later, huh?"
1,DEAN,"Yeah, all right."
1,DEAN,Sam?
1,DEAN,"You know, we made a hell of a team back there."
1,SAM,Yeah.
1,SAM,Jess?
1,SAM,You home?
1,SAM,No!
1,DEAN,Sam!
1,SAM,Jess!
1,DEAN,Sam! Sam!
1,SAM,No! No!
1,SAM,Jess! Jess! No!
1,SAM,We got work to do.
1,LUIS,Ha!
1,LUIS,"What do you think, huh?"
1,SAM,Whatever.
1,LUIS,"At least I wore a costume. Man, if your sorry ass was trick-or-treating at my house, there would be no popcorn balls for you."
1,SAM,You gave out popcorn balls?
1,LUIS,"You could at least have gone as a slutty version of something. Slutty Dorothy, slutty Alice, slutty nurse—"
1,JESS,Hey.
1,LUIS,I—I didn't mean you.
1,SAM,"Man, what can I say? I just never been a big fan of the whole thing."
1,LUIS,"Never been a fan—what, what, are you a Communist? Who doesn't like Halloween?"
1,SAM,Jess?
1,SAM,You home?
1,SAM,No!
1,DEAN,Hey. How you doing?
1,SAM,I'm fine.
1,SAM,Come on. We got work to do.
2,JOHN,"Take your brother outside as fast as you can! Now, Dean, go!"
2,JOHN,Mary! No!
2,DEAN,Dad's on a hunting trip.
2,DEAN,And he hasn't been home in a few days.
2,SAM,"Jess, excuse us."
2,SAM,I swore I was done hunting.
2,SAM,For good.
2,DEAN,I can't do this alone.
2,JESS,And now you're taking off in the middle of the night to spend the weekend with them?
2,SAM,Hey. Everything's going to be okay. I promise.
2,DEAN,You have a responsibility.
2,SAM,"Even if we do find the thing that killed her, Mom's gone. And she isn't coming back."
2,DEAN,Don't talk about her like that.
2,SAM,"Hey Dean? What I said earlier, I'm sorry."
2,DEAN,No chick-flick moments.
2,SAM,Jess?
2,SAM,No!
2,SAM,We've got work to do.
2,BRAD,"Dude, you're cheating."
2,GARY,"No, you just suck."
2,TOM,"Hey Haley, day six, we're still out near Blackwater Ridge."
2,TOM,"We're fine, keeping safe, so don't worry, okay? Talk to you tomorrow."
2,GARY,"Hey, where ya goin'? My moment of victory."
2,BRAD,Nature calls.
2,GARY,Brad?
2,TOM,"Gary, what's goin' on?"
2,SAM,"I, uh..."
2,SAM,"You always said roses were, were lame, so I brought you, uh..."
2,SAM,Jess...oh God...
2,SAM,I should have protected you. I should have told you the truth.
2,DEAN,You okay?
2,SAM,"Yeah, I'm fine."
2,DEAN,Another nightmare?
2,DEAN,You wanna drive for a while?
2,SAM,"Dean, your whole life you never once asked me that."
2,DEAN,Just thought you might want to. Never mind.
2,SAM,"Look, man, you're worried about me."
2,SAM,"I get it, and thank you, but I'm perfectly okay."
2,DEAN,Mm-hm.
2,SAM,"All right, where are we?"
2,DEAN,We are just outside of Grand Junction.
2,SAM,You know what?
2,SAM,Maybe we shouldn't have left Stanford so soon.
2,DEAN,"Sam, we dug around there for a week. We came up with nothing. If you wanna find the thing that killed Jessica—"
2,SAM,We gotta find Dad first.
2,DEAN,Dad disappearing—
2,DEAN,"—and this thing showing up again after twenty years, it's no coincidence."
2,DEAN,Dad will have answers. He'll know what to do.
2,SAM,"It's weird, man."
2,SAM,These coordinates he left us.
2,SAM,This Blackwater Ridge.
2,DEAN,What about it?
2,SAM,There's nothing there. It's just woods.
2,SAM,Why is he sending us to the middle of nowhere?
2,SAM,"It's cut off by these canyons here, rough terrain, dense forest, abandoned silver and gold mines all over the place."
2,DEAN,"Dude, check out the size of this freaking bear."
2,SAM,"And a dozen or more grizzlies in the area. It's no nature hike, that's for sure."
2,RANGER,You boys aren't planning on going out near Blackwater Ridge by any chance?
2,SAM,"Oh, no, sir, we're environmental study majors from UC Boulder, just working on a paper."
2,DEAN,"Recycle, man."
2,RANGER,Bull.
2,RANGER,"You're friends with that Haley girl, right?"
2,DEAN,"Yes. Yes, we are, Ranger—"
2,DEAN,Wilkinson.
2,RANGER,"Well I will tell you exactly what we told her. Her brother filled out a backcountry permit saying he wouldn't be back from Blackwater until the twenty-fourth, so it's not exactly a missing persons now, is it?"
2,RANGER,"You tell that girl to quit worrying, I'm sure her brother's just fine."
2,DEAN,"We will. Well that Haley girl's quite a pistol, huh?"
2,RANGER,That is putting it mildly.
2,DEAN,"Actually you know what would help is if I could show her a copy of that backcountry permit. You know, so she could see her brother's return date."
2,SAM,"What, are you cruising for a hookup or something?"
2,DEAN,What do you mean?
2,SAM,"The coordinates point to Blackwater Ridge, so what are we waiting for? Let's just go find Dad. I mean, why even talk to this girl?"
2,DEAN,"I don't know, maybe we should know what we're walking into before we actually walk into it?"
2,SAM,What?
2,DEAN,"Since when are you all shoot first ask questions later, anyway?"
2,SAM,Since now.
2,DEAN,Really?
2,DEAN,"You must be Haley Collins. I'm Dean, this is Sam, we're, ah, we're rangers with the Park Service. Ranger Wilkinson sent us over. He wanted us to ask a few questions about your brother Tommy."
2,HALEY,Lemme see some ID.
2,HALEY,Come on in.
2,DEAN,Thanks.
2,HALEY,That yours?
2,DEAN,Yeah.
2,HALEY,Nice car.
2,SAM,"So if Tommy's not due back for a while, how do you know something's wrong?"
2,HALEY,"He checks in every day by cell. He emails, photos, stupid little videos—we haven't heard anything in over three days now."
2,SAM,"Well, maybe he can't get cell reception."
2,HALEY,"He's got a satellite phone, too."
2,DEAN,Could it be he's just having fun and forgot to check in?
2,BEN,He wouldn't do that.
2,HALEY,Our parents are gone. It's just my two brothers and me. We all keep pretty close tabs on each other.
2,SAM,Can I see the pictures he sent you?
2,HALEY,Yeah.
2,HALEY,That's Tommy.
2,TOM,"Hey Haley, day six, we're still out near Blackwater Ridge. We're fine, keeping safe, so don't worry, okay? Talk to you tomorrow."
2,DEAN,"Well, we'll find your brother. We're heading out to Blackwater Ridge first thing."
2,HALEY,"Then maybe I'll see you there. Look, I can't sit around here anymore. So I hired a guy. I'm heading out in the morning, and I'm gonna find Tommy myself."
2,DEAN,I think I know how you feel.
2,SAM,"Hey, do you mind forwarding these to me?"
2,HALEY,Sure.
2,SAM,"So, Blackwater Ridge doesn't get a lot of traffic. Local campers, mostly. But still, this past April, two hikers went missing out there. They were never found."
2,DEAN,Any before that?
2,SAM,"Yeah, in 1982, eight different people all vanished in the same year. Authorities said it was a grizzly attack."
2,SAM,And again in 1959 and again before that in 1936.
2,SAM,"Every twenty-three years, just like clockwork. Okay. Watch this. Here's a clincher. I downloaded that guy Tommy's video to the laptop. Check this out."
2,DEAN,Do it again.
2,SAM,"That's three frames. That's a fraction of a second. Whatever that thing is, it can move."
2,DEAN,Told you something weird was going on.
2,SAM,Yeah.
2,SAM,I got one more thing.
2,SAM,In 'fifty-nine one camper survived this supposed grizzly attack. Just a kid. Barely crawled out of the woods alive.
2,DEAN,Is there a name?
2,SHAW,"Look, ranger, I don't know why you're asking me about this. It's public record. I was a kid. My parents got mauled by a—"
2,SAM,Grizzly? That's what attacked them?
2,DEAN,"The other people that went missing that year, those bear attacks too?"
2,DEAN,What about all the people that went missing this year? Same thing?
2,DEAN,"We knew what we were dealing with, we might be able to stop it."
2,SHAW,"I seriously doubt that. Anyways, I don't see what difference it would make."
2,SHAW,You wouldn't believe me. Nobody ever did.
2,SAM,"Mr. Shaw, what did you see?"
2,SHAW,"Nothing. It moved too fast to see. It hid too well. I heard it, though. A roar. Like...no man or animal I ever heard."
2,SAM,It came at night?
2,SAM,Got inside your tent?
2,SHAW,It got inside our cabin. I was sleeping in front of the fireplace when it came in. It didn't smash a window or break the door. It unlocked it. Do you know of a bear that could do something like that? I didn't even wake up till I heard my parents screaming.
2,SAM,It killed them?
2,SHAW,Dragged them off into the night.
2,SHAW,Why it left me alive...been asking myself that ever since.
2,SHAW,"Did leave me this, though."
2,SHAW,There's something evil in those woods. It was some sort of a demon.
2,DEAN,"Spirits and demons don't have to unlock doors. If they want inside, they just go through the walls."
2,SAM,"So it's probably something else, something corporeal."
2,DEAN,"Corporeal? Excuse me, professor."
2,SAM,Shut up. So what do you think?
2,DEAN,"The claws, the speed that it moves...could be a skinwalker, maybe a black dog. Whatever we're talking about, we're talking about a creature, and it's corporeal. Which means we can kill it."
2,SAM,We cannot let that Haley girl go out there.
2,DEAN,Oh yeah? What are we gonna tell her? That she can't go into the woods because of a big scary monster?
2,SAM,Yeah.
2,DEAN,"Her brother's missing, Sam. She's not gonna just sit this out. Now we go with her, we protect her, and we keep our eyes peeled for our fuzzy predator friend."
2,SAM,Finding Dad's not enough?
2,SAM,Now we gotta babysit too?
2,SAM,What?
2,DEAN,Nothing.
2,ROY,"I'll tell you again, I don't think Ben should come."
2,HALEY,Roy—
2,ROY,"Look, you're paying me good money to keep everybody safe. I think Ben's safest at home."
2,DEAN,You guys got room for two more?
2,HALEY,"Wait, you want to come with us?"
2,ROY,Who are these guys?
2,HALEY,Apparently this is all the park service could muster up for the search and rescue.
2,ROY,You're rangers?
2,DEAN,That's right.
2,HALEY,And you're hiking out in biker boots and jeans?
2,DEAN,"Well, sweetheart, I don't do shorts."
2,ROY,"What, you think this is funny? It's dangerous back country out there. Her brother might be hurt."
2,DEAN,"Believe me, I know how dangerous it can be. We just wanna help them find their brother, that's all."
2,DEAN,"Roy, you said you did a little hunting."
2,ROY,"Yeah, more than a little."
2,DEAN,Uh-huh. What kind of furry critters do you hunt?
2,ROY,"Mostly buck, sometimes bear."
2,DEAN,"Tell me, uh, Bambi or Yogi ever hunt you back?"
2,DEAN,"Whatcha doing, Roy?"
2,ROY,You should watch where you're stepping. Ranger.
2,DEAN,It's a bear trap.
2,HALEY,So who the hell are you?
2,DEAN,"Sam and I are brothers, and we're looking for our father. He might be here, we don't know. I just figured that you and me, we're in the same boat."
2,HALEY,Why didn't you just tell me that from the start?
2,DEAN,"I'm telling you now. 'sides, it's probably the most honest I've ever been with a woman. ...ever. So we okay?"
2,HALEY,"Yeah, okay."
2,DEAN,And what do you mean I didn't pack provisions?
2,ROY,This is it. Blackwater Ridge.
2,SAM,What coordinates are we at?
2,ROY,Thirty-five and minus one-eleven.
2,DEAN,You hear that?
2,SAM,Yeah. Not even crickets.
2,ROY,I'm gonna go take a look around.
2,SAM,You shouldn't go off by yourself.
2,ROY,That's sweet. Don't worry about me.
2,DEAN,"All right, everybody stays together. Let's go."
2,ROY,Haley! Over here!
2,HALEY,Oh my God.
2,ROY,Looks like a grizzly.
2,HALEY,Tommy?
2,HALEY,Tommy!
2,SAM,Shh.
2,HALEY,Tommy!
2,SAM,Shh-hh-hh!
2,HALEY,Why?
2,SAM,Something might still be out there.
2,DEAN,Sam!
2,DEAN,"The bodies were dragged from the campsite. But here, the tracks just vanish. That's weird."
2,DEAN,"I'll tell you what, that's no skinwalker or black dog."
2,DEAN,"Hey, he could still be alive."
2,SOMEONE,Help! Help!
2,SOMEONE,Help! Somebody!
2,HALEY,"It seemed like it was coming from around here, didn't it?"
2,SAM,Everybody back to camp.
2,HALEY,Our packs!
2,ROY,So much for my GPS and my satellite phone.
2,HALEY,What the hell is going on?
2,SAM,It's smart. It wants to cut us off so we can't call for help.
2,ROY,"You mean someone, some nutjob out there just stole all our gear."
2,SAM,I need to speak with you. In private.
2,SAM,Good. Let me see Dad's journal.
2,SAM,"All right, check that out."
2,DEAN,"Oh come on, wendigos are in the Minnesota woods or, or northern Michigan. I've never even heard of one this far west."
2,SAM,"Think about it, Dean, the claws, the way it can mimic a human voice."
2,DEAN,Great.
2,DEAN,Well then this is useless.
2,SAM,We gotta get these people to safety.
2,SAM,"All right, listen up, it's time to go. Things have gotten...more complicated."
2,HALEY,What?
2,ROY,"Kid, don't worry. Whatever's out there, I think I can handle it."
2,SAM,"It's not me I'm worried about. If you shoot this thing, you're just gonna make it mad. We have to leave. Now."
2,ROY,"One, you're talking nonsense. Two, you're in no position to give anybody orders."
2,DEAN,Relax.
2,SAM,"We never should have let you come out here in the first place, all right? I'm trying to protect you."
2,ROY,You protect me? I was hunting these woods when your mommy was still kissing you good night.
2,SAM,"Yeah? It's a damn near perfect hunter. It's smarter than you, and it's gonna hunt you down and eat you alive unless we get your stupid sorry ass out of here."
2,ROY,"You know you're crazy, right?"
2,SAM,Yeah? You ever hunt a wen—
2,HALEY,Roy!
2,DEAN,Chill out.
2,HALEY,Stop. Stop it. Everybody just stop. Look. Tommy might still be alive. And I'm not leaving here without him.
2,DEAN,"It's getting late. This thing is a good hunter in the day, but an unbelievable hunter at night. We'll never beat it, not in the dark. We need to settle in and protect ourselves."
2,HALEY,How?
2,HALEY,"One more time, that's—"
2,DEAN,Anasazi symbols. It's for protection. The wendigo can't cross over them.
2,DEAN,"Nobody likes a skeptic, Roy."
2,DEAN,You wanna tell me what's going on in that freaky head of yours?
2,SAM,Dean—
2,DEAN,"No, you're not fine. You're like a powder keg, man, it's not like you. I'm supposed to be the belligerent one, remember?"
2,SAM,"Dad's not here. I mean, that much we know for sure, right? He would have left us a message, a sign, right?"
2,DEAN,"Yeah, you're probably right. Tell you the truth, I don't think Dad's ever been to Lost Creek."
2,SAM,"Then let's get these people back to town and let's hit the road. Go find Dad. I mean, why are we still even here?"
2,DEAN,This is why.
2,DEAN,"This book. This is Dad's single most valuable possession—everything he knows about every evil thing is in here. And he's passed it on to us. I think he wants us to pick up where he left off. You know, saving people, hunting things. The family business."
2,SAM,"That makes no sense. Why doesn't he just—call us? Why doesn't he—tell us what he wants, tell us where he is?"
2,DEAN,"I dunno. But the way I see it, Dad's giving us a job to do, and I intend to do it."
2,SAM,Dean...no. I gotta find Dad. I gotta find Jessica's killer. It's the only thing I can think about.
2,DEAN,"Okay, all right, Sam, we'll find them, I promise. Listen to me. You've gotta prepare yourself. I mean, this search could take a while, and all that anger, you can't keep it burning over the long haul. It's gonna kill you. You gotta have patience, man."
2,SAM,How do you do it? How does Dad do it?
2,DEAN,"Well for one, them."
2,DEAN,"I mean, I figure our family's so screwed to hell, maybe we can help some others. Makes things a little bit more bearable."
2,DEAN,I'll tell you what else helps.
2,DEAN,Killing as many evil sons of bitches as I possibly can.
2,WENDIGO,Help!
2,DEAN,"He's trying to draw us out. Just stay cool, stay put."
2,ROY,Inside the magic circle?
2,WENDIGO,Help! Help me!
2,ROY,"Okay, that's no grizzly."
2,HALEY,"It's okay. You'll be all right, I promise."
2,SAM,It's here.
2,ROY,I hit it!
2,DEAN,"Roy, no! Roy!"
2,DEAN,Don't move.
2,ROY,It's over here! It's in the tree!
2,DEAN,Roy!
2,HALEY,"I don't...I mean, these types of things, they aren't supposed to be real."
2,DEAN,I wish I could tell you different.
2,HALEY,How do we know it's not out there watching us?
2,DEAN,We don't. But we're safe for now.
2,HALEY,How do you know about this stuff?
2,DEAN,Kind of runs in the family.
2,SAM,Hey.
2,SAM,So we've got half a chance in the daylight. And I for one want to kill this evil son of a bitch.
2,DEAN,"Well, hell, you know I'm in."
2,SAM,'Wendigo' is a Cree Indian word. It means 'evil that devours'.
2,DEAN,"They're hundreds of years old. Each one was once a man. Sometimes an Indian, or other times a frontiersman or a miner or hunter."
2,HALEY,How's a man turn into one of those things?
2,DEAN,"Well, it's always the same. During some harsh winter a guy finds himself starving, cut off from supplies or help. Becomes a cannibal to survive, eating other members of his tribe or camp."
2,BEN,Like the Donner Party.
2,SAM,"Cultures all over the world believe that eating human flesh gives a person certain abilities. Speed, strength, immortality."
2,DEAN,"If you eat enough of it, over years, you become this less than human thing. You're always hungry."
2,HALEY,"So if that's true, how can Tommy still be alive?"
2,DEAN,You're not gonna like it.
2,HALEY,Tell me.
2,DEAN,"More than anything, a wendigo knows how to last long winters without food. It hibernates for years at a time, but when it's awake it keeps its victims alive. It, uh, it stores them, so it can feed whenever it wants. If your brother's alive, it's keeping him somewhere dark, hidden, and safe. We gotta track it back there."
2,HALEY,And then how do we stop it?
2,DEAN,"Well, guns are useless, so are knives. Basically—"
2,DEAN,We gotta torch the sucker.
2,SAM,Dean.
2,DEAN,What is it?
2,SAM,"You know, I was thinking, those claw prints, so clear and distinct. They were almost too easy to follow."
2,SAM,You okay? You got it?
2,DEAN,His neck's broke.
2,DEAN,"Okay, run, run, run, run, go, go, go!"
2,SAM,"Come on, I gotcha, I gotcha."
2,BEN,Haley?
2,SAM,Dean!
2,BEN,"If it keeps its victims alive, why would it kill Roy?"
2,SAM,"Honestly? I think because Roy shot at it, pissed it off."
2,BEN,They went this way.
2,SAM,It's better than breadcrumbs.
2,SAM,"Hey, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
2,SAM,Dean!
2,BEN,"Haley, wake up!"
2,SAM,Dean!
2,SAM,"Hey, you okay?"
2,DEAN,Yeah.
2,BEN,"Haley, Haley, wake up, wake up!"
2,SAM,You sure you're all right?
2,DEAN,Yeah. Yep. Where is he?
2,SAM,He's gone for now.
2,HALEY,Tommy...
2,HALEY,Cut him down!
2,HALEY,We're gonna get you home.
2,DEAN,Check it out.
2,SAM,Flare guns. Those'll work.
2,DEAN,Looks like someone's home for supper.
2,HALEY,We'll never outrun it.
2,DEAN,You thinking what I'm thinking?
2,SAM,"Yeah, I think so."
2,DEAN,"All right, listen to me. Stay with Sam. He's gonna get you out of here."
2,HALEY,What are you gonna do?
2,SAM,"All right, come on! Hurry!"
2,DEAN,"Hey, you want some white meat, bitch! I'm right here!"
2,SAM,Get him outta here.
2,HALEY,"Sam, no."
2,BEN,"Come on, Haley!"
2,SAM,Come on. Come on.
2,HALEY,Sam!
2,SAM,"Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry."
2,SAM,Get behind me.
2,DEAN,Hey!
2,DEAN,"Not bad, huh?"
2,OFFICER,And the bear came back again after you yelled at it?
2,BEN,"That's when it circled the campsite. I mean, this grizzly must have weighed eight hundred, nine hundred pounds."
2,OFFICER,"All right, we'll go after it first thing."
2,HALEY,So I don't know how to thank you.
2,HALEY,Must you cheapen the moment?
2,DEAN,Yeah.
2,PARAMEDIC,You riding with your brother?
2,HALEY,Yeah.
2,HALEY,Let's go.
2,HALEY,I hope you find your father.
2,HALEY,"Thanks, Sam."
2,DEAN,"Man, I hate camping."
2,SAM,Me too.
2,DEAN,"Sam, you know we're gonna find Dad, right?"
2,SAM,"Yeah, I know. But in the meantime? I'm driving."
2,SAM,"That's a hell of a find, Ben. Those are Anasazi."
2,BEN,What's that?
2,SAM,Ancient Indians. They were this whole civilization that just vanished completely. No one really knows why.
2,SAM,I've seen that somewhere before.
2,ROY,Haley! Over here!
3,JOHN,"Take your brother outside as fast as you can! Now, Dean, go!"
3,JOHN,Mary! No!
3,DEAN,Dad's on a hunting trip.
3,DEAN,And he hasn't been home in a few days.
3,SAM,I swore I was done hunting.
3,DEAN,I can't do this alone.
3,SAM,No!
3,SAM,We've got work to do.
3,DEAN,—most valuable possession—everything he knows about every evil thing is in here. And he's passed it on to us. I think he wants us to—
3,DEAN,The family business.
3,SAM,No. I gotta find Jessica's killer.
3,DEAN,"Sam, you know we're gonna find Dad, right?"
3,SAM,Yeah. I know.
3,SOPHIE,"Morning, Daddy."
3,BILL,"Morning, sweetheart."
3,WILL,"All these workouts, Soph, I don't know. Guys don't like buff girls."
3,SOPHIE,"Yeah, well, girls don't like guys who still live at home."
3,WILL,Ha ha ha.
3,SOPHIE,Ha ha.
3,BILL,Be careful.
3,SOPHIE,I will.
3,WENDY,Can I get you anything else?
3,SAM,"Just the check, please."
3,WENDY,Okay.
3,DEAN,"You know, Sam, we are allowed to have fun once in a while."
3,DEAN,That's fun.
3,DEAN,"Here, take a look at this, I think I got one. Lake Manitoc, Wisconsin. Last week Sophie Carlton, eighteen, walks into the lake, doesn't walk out. Authorities dragged the water; nothing. Sophie Carlton is the third Lake Manitoc drowning this year. None of the other bodies were found either. They had a funeral two days ago."
3,SAM,A funeral?
3,DEAN,"Yeah, it's weird, they buried an empty coffin. For, uh, closure or whatever."
3,SAM,"Closure? What closure? People don't just disappear, Dean. Other people just stop looking for them."
3,DEAN,Something you want to say to me?
3,SAM,The trail for Dad. It's getting colder every day.
3,DEAN,Exactly. So what are we supposed to do?
3,SAM,I don't know. Something. Anything.
3,DEAN,You know what? I'm sick of this attitude. You don't think I wanna find Dad as much as you do?
3,SAM,"Yeah, I know you do, it's just—"
3,DEAN,"I'm the one that's been with him every single day for the past two years, while you've been off to college going to pep rallies. We will find Dad, but until then, we're gonna kill everything bad between here and there. Okay?"
3,SAM,"All right, Lake Manitoc. Hey!"
3,DEAN,Huh?
3,SAM,How far?
3,DEAN,Will Carlton?
3,WILL,"Yeah, that's right."
3,DEAN,I'm Agent Ford. This is Agent Hamill.
3,DEAN,We're with the US Wildlife Service.
3,WILL,She was about a hundred yards out.
3,WILL,That's where she got dragged down.
3,DEAN,And you're sure she didn't just drown?
3,WILL,Yeah. She was a varsity swimmer.
3,WILL,She practically grew up in that lake. She was as safe out there as in her own bathtub.
3,SAM,So no splashing? No signs of distress?
3,WILL,"No, that's what I'm telling you."
3,SAM,Did you see any shadows in the water? Maybe some dark shape breach the surface?
3,WILL,"No. Again, she was really far out there."
3,DEAN,You ever see any strange tracks by the shoreline?
3,WILL,"No, never. Why? Why, what do you think's out there?"
3,DEAN,We'll let you know as soon as we do.
3,SAM,What about your father?
3,SAM,Can we talk to him?
3,WILL,"Look, if you don't mind, I mean...he didn't see anything and he's kind of been through a lot."
3,SAM,We understand.
3,JAKE,"Now, I'm sorry, but why does the Wildlife Service care about an accidental drowning?"
3,SAM,You sure it's accidental? Will Carlton saw something grab his sister.
3,JAKE,Like what?
3,JAKE,"Here, sit, please. There are no indigenous carnivores in that lake."
3,JAKE,"There's nothing even big enough to pull down a person, unless it was the Loch Ness Monster."
3,DEAN,Yeah.
3,DEAN,Right.
3,JAKE,"Will Carlton was traumatized, and sometimes the mind plays tricks. Still—"
3,JAKE,"We dragged that entire lake. We even ran a sonar sweep, just to be sure, and there was nothing down there."
3,DEAN,"That's weird, though, I mean, that's, that's the third missing body this year."
3,JAKE,I know. These are people from my town. These are people I care about.
3,DEAN,I know.
3,JAKE,Anyway...
3,JAKE,All this...it won't be a problem much longer.
3,DEAN,What do you mean?
3,JAKE,"Well, the dam, of course."
3,DEAN,"Of course, the dam. It's, uh, it sprung a leak."
3,JAKE,"It's falling apart, and the feds won't give us the grant to repair it, so they've opened the spillway. In another six months, there won't be much of a lake. There won't be much of a town, either. But as Federal Wildlife, you already knew that."
3,DEAN,Exactly.
3,ANDREA,"Sorry, am I interrupting?"
3,ANDREA,I can come back later.
3,JAKE,"Gentlemen, this is my daughter."
3,DEAN,It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dean.
3,ANDREA,Andrea Barr. Hi.
3,DEAN,Hi.
3,JAKE,They're from the Wildlife Service. About the lake.
3,ANDREA,Oh.
3,DEAN,"Oh, hey there. What's your name?"
3,JAKE,His name is Lucas.
3,SAM,Is he okay?
3,JAKE,My grandson's been through a lot. We all have.
3,JAKE,"Well, if there's anything else I can do for you, please let me know."
3,DEAN,"Thanks. You know, now that you mentioned it, could you point us in the direction of a reasonably priced motel?"
3,ANDREA,Lakefront Motel. Go around the corner. It's about two blocks south.
3,DEAN,Two—would you mind showing us?
3,ANDREA,You want me to walk you two blocks?
3,DEAN,Not if it's any trouble.
3,ANDREA,I'm headed that way anyway.
3,ANDREA,I'll be back to pick up Lucas at three.
3,ANDREA,"We'll go to the park, okay, sweetie?"
3,SAM,Thanks again.
3,DEAN,"So, cute kid."
3,ANDREA,Thanks.
3,DEAN,"Kids are the best, huh?"
3,ANDREA,"There it is. Like I said, two blocks."
3,SAM,Thanks.
3,ANDREA,"Must be hard, with your sense of direction, never being able to find your way to a decent pickup line."
3,ANDREA,Enjoy your stay!
3,SAM,'Kids are the best'? You don't even like kids.
3,DEAN,I love kids.
3,SAM,Name three children that you even know.
3,DEAN,I'm thinking!
3,SAM,So there's the three drowning victims this year.
3,DEAN,Any before that?
3,SAM,"Uh, yeah."
3,SAM,"Six more spread out over the past thirty-five years. Those bodies were never recovered either. If there is something out there, it's picking up its pace."
3,DEAN,"So, what, we got a lake monster on a binge?"
3,SAM,"This whole lake monster theory, it, it just bugs me."
3,DEAN,Why?
3,SAM,"Loch Ness, uh, Lake Champlain, there are literally hundreds of eyewitness accounts, but here, almost nothing."
3,SAM,"Whatever it is out there, no one's living to talk about it."
3,DEAN,"Wait, Barr, Christopher Barr. Where have I heard that name before?"
3,SAM,"Christopher Barr, the victim in May."
3,SAM,"Oh. Christopher Barr was Andrea's husband, Lucas's father. Apparently he took Lucas out swimming. Lucas was on a floating wooden platform when Chris drowned. Two hours before the kid got rescued."
3,SAM,Maybe we have an eyewitness after all.
3,DEAN,No wonder that kid was so freaked out. Watching one of your parents die isn't something you just get over.
3,ANDREA,I'm here with my son.
3,DEAN,Oh. Mind if I say hi?
3,SAM,I don't think that's what this is about.
3,DEAN,How's it going?
3,DEAN,"Oh, I used to love these things."
3,DEAN,So crayons is more your thing? That's cool. Chicks dig artists.
3,DEAN,"Hey, these are pretty good. You mind if I sit and draw with you for a while?"
3,DEAN,I'm not so bad myself.
3,DEAN,"You know, I'm thinking you can hear me, you just don't want to talk. I don't know exactly what happened to your dad, but I know it was something real bad. I think I know how you feel. When I was your age, I saw something."
3,DEAN,"Anyway. Well, maybe you don't think anyone will listen to you, or, uh...or believe you. I want you to know that I will. You don't even have to say anything. You could draw me a picture about what you saw that day, with your dad, on the lake. Okay, no problem. This is for you."
3,DEAN,This is my family.
3,DEAN,"That's my dad. That's my mom. That's my geek brother, and that's me."
3,DEAN,"All right, so I'm a sucky artist. I'll see you around, Lucas."
3,ANDREA,"Lucas hasn't said a word, not even to me. Not since his dad's accident."
3,DEAN,"Yeah, we heard. Sorry."
3,SAM,What are the doctors saying?
3,ANDREA,That it's a kind of post-traumatic stress.
3,SAM,That can't be easy. For either of you.
3,ANDREA,"We moved in with my dad. He helps out a lot. It's just...when I think about what Lucas went through, what he saw..."
3,DEAN,Kids are strong. You'd be surprised what they can deal with.
3,ANDREA,"You know, he used to have such life. He was hard to keep up with, to tell you the truth. Now he just sits there. Drawing those pictures, playing with those army men. I just wish—"
3,ANDREA,Hey sweetie.
3,DEAN,"Thanks. Thanks, Lucas."
3,WILL,"Hey, Dad? You, you should probably eat something. I'm gonna make some dinner, okay?"
3,SAM,"So, I think it's safe to say we can rule out Nessie."
3,DEAN,What do you mean?
3,SAM,I just drove past the Carlton house. There was an ambulance there. Will Carlton is dead.
3,DEAN,He drowned?
3,SAM,Yep. In the sink.
3,DEAN,"What the hell? So you're right, this isn't a creature. We're dealing with something else."
3,SAM,"Yeah, but what?"
3,DEAN,"I don't know. Water wraith, maybe? Some kind of demon? I mean, something that controls water...water that comes from the same source."
3,SAM,The lake.
3,DEAN,Yeah.
3,SAM,"Which would explain why it's upping the body count. The lake is draining. It'll be dry in a few months. Whatever this thing is, whatever it wants, it's running out of time."
3,DEAN,"And if it can get through the pipes, it can get to anyone, almost anywhere."
3,DEAN,This is gonna happen again soon.
3,DEAN,"Yeah, it took both his kids."
3,SAM,"And I've been asking around. Lucas's dad, Chris—Bill Carlton's godson."
3,DEAN,Let's go pay Mr. Carlton a visit.
3,SAM,"We'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind."
3,DEAN,"We're from the, the Department—"
3,BILL,I don't care who you're with. I've answered enough questions today.
3,SAM,"Your son said he saw something in that lake. What about you? You ever see anything out there? Mr. Carlton, Sophie's drowning and Will's death—we think there might be a connection to you or your family."
3,BILL,My children are gone. It's...it's worse than dying. Go away. Please.
3,SAM,What do you think?
3,DEAN,"Aw, I think the poor guy's been through hell. I also think he's not telling us something."
3,SAM,So now what?
3,SAM,What is it?
3,DEAN,Huh.
3,DEAN,Maybe Bill's not the only one who knows something.
3,DEAN,Just for a few minutes.
3,ANDREA,He won't say anything. What good's it gonna do?
3,SAM,"Andrea, we think more people might get hurt. We think something's happening out there."
3,ANDREA,"My husband, the others, they just drowned. That's all."
3,DEAN,"Hey, Lucas. You remember me?"
3,DEAN,"You know, I, uh, I wanted to thank you for that last drawing. But the thing is, I need your help again."
3,DEAN,How did you know to draw this? Did you know something bad was gonna happen? Maybe you could nod yes or no for me.
3,DEAN,"You're scared. It's okay. I understand. See, when I was your age, I saw something real bad happen to my mom, and I was scared, too. I didn't feel like talking, just like you. But see, my mom—I know she wanted me to be brave. I think about that every day. And I do my best to be brave. And maybe, your dad wants you to be brave too."
3,DEAN,"Thanks, Lucas."
3,DEAN,Andrea said the kid never drew like that till his dad died.
3,SAM,"There are cases—going through a traumatic experience could make people more sensitive to premonitions, psychic tendencies."
3,DEAN,"Whatever's out there, what if Lucas is tapping into it somehow? I mean, it's only a matter of time before somebody else drowns, so if you got a better lead, please."
3,SAM,"All right, we got another house to find."
3,DEAN,The only problem is there's about a thousand yellow two-stories in this county alone.
3,SAM,See this church? I bet there's less than a thousand of those around here.
3,DEAN,"Oh, College Boy thinks he's so smart."
3,SAM,"You know, um..."
3,SAM,What you said about Mom...
3,SAM,You never told me that before.
3,DEAN,It's no big deal.
3,DEAN,"Oh God, we're not gonna have to hug or anything, are we?"
3,DEAN,"—but does a little boy live here, by chance? He might wear a blue ball cap, has a red bicycle."
3,SWEENEY,No sir. Not for a very long time. Peter's been gone for thirty-five years now.
3,SWEENEY,"Losing him—you know, it's...it's worse than dying."
3,DEAN,"Did he disappear from here? I mean, from this house?"
3,SWEENEY,"He was supposed to ride his bike straight home after school, and he never showed up."
3,DEAN,"Peter Sweeney and Billy Carlton, nineteen seventy."
3,BILL,"You've taken everything, everyone. I've got nothing left. I didn't understand. I didn't believe. Now I think I do. I think I finally know what you want."
3,SAM,"Okay, this little boy Peter Sweeney vanishes, and this is all connected to Bill Carlton somehow."
3,DEAN,"Yeah, Bill sure as hell seems to be hiding something, huh?"
3,SAM,"And Bill, the people he loves, they're all getting punished."
3,DEAN,So what if Bill did something to Peter?
3,SAM,What if Bill killed him?
3,DEAN,Peter's spirit would be furious. It'd want revenge. It's possible.
3,SAM,Mr. Carlton?
3,DEAN,"Hey, check it out."
3,DEAN,Mr. Carlton! You need to come back! Come out of the water! Turn the boat around!
3,SAM,Mr. Carlton!
3,ANDREA,"Baby, what's wrong?"
3,ANDREA,"Sam, Dean."
3,ANDREA,I didn't expect to see you here.
3,JAKE,So now you're on a first-name basis. What are you doing here?
3,ANDREA,I brought you dinner.
3,JAKE,"I'm sorry, sweetheart, I don't really have the time."
3,ANDREA,I heard about Bill Carlton. Is it true? Is something going on with the lake?
3,JAKE,Right now we don't know what the truth is. But I think it might be better if you and Lucas went on home.
3,DEAN,"Lucas, hey, what is it?"
3,DEAN,Lucas.
3,ANDREA,Lucas.
3,DEAN,"Lucas, it's okay. It's okay. Hey, Lucas, it's okay. It's okay."
3,JAKE,"Okay, just so I'm clear, you see...something attack Bill's boat, sending Bill—who is a very good swimmer, by the way—into the drink, and you never see him again?"
3,DEAN,"Yeah, that about sums it up."
3,JAKE,"And I'm supposed to believe this, even though I've already sonar-swept that entire lake? And what you're describing is impossible? And you're not really Wildlife Service?"
3,JAKE,"That's right, I checked. Department's never heard of you two."
3,DEAN,"See, now, we can explain that."
3,JAKE,"Enough. Please. The only reason you're breathing free air is one of Bill's neighbors saw him steering out that boat just before you did. So, we have a couple of options here. I can arrest you for impersonating government officials and hold you as material witnesses to Bill Carlton's disappearance. Or, we can chalk this all up to a bad day, you get into your car, you put this town in your rearview mirror, and you don't ever darken my doorstep again."
3,SAM,Door number two sounds good.
3,JAKE,That's the one I'd pick.
3,ANDREA,"Baby, what are you doing up? Come on. Let's go to bed."
3,SAM,Green.
3,DEAN,What?
3,SAM,Light's green.
3,SAM,"Uh, the interstate's the other way."
3,DEAN,I know.
3,SAM,"But Dean, this job, I think it's over."
3,DEAN,I'm not so sure.
3,SAM,"If Bill murdered Peter Sweeney and Peter's spirit got its revenge, case closed. The spirit should be at rest."
3,DEAN,"All right, so what if we take off and this thing isn't done? You know, what if we've missed something? What if more people get hurt?"
3,SAM,But why would you think that?
3,DEAN,Because Lucas was really scared.
3,SAM,That's what this is about?
3,DEAN,I just don't want to leave this town until I know the kid's okay.
3,SAM,Who are you? And what have you done with my brother?
3,DEAN,Shut up.
3,SAM,"Are you sure about this? It's pretty late, man."
3,DEAN,Lucas? Lucas!
3,SAM,Can you tell me?
3,ANDREA,No.
3,ANDREA,It doesn't make any sense.
3,ANDREA,I'm going crazy.
3,SAM,"No, you're not. Tell me what happened. Everything."
3,ANDREA,I heard...I thought I heard...there was this voice.
3,SAM,What did it say?
3,ANDREA,It said...it said 'come play with me'.
3,ANDREA,What's happening?
3,DEAN,Do you recognize the kids in these pictures?
3,ANDREA,"What? Um, um, no. I mean, except that's my dad right there. He must have been about twelve in these pictures."
3,DEAN,Chris Barr's drowning. The connection wasn't to Bill Carlton. It must have been to the sheriff.
3,ANDREA,What about Chris? My dad—what are you talking about?
3,DEAN,Lucas?
3,DEAN,"Lucas, what is it?"
3,ANDREA,"Lucas, honey?"
3,DEAN,"You and Lucas get back to the house and stay there, okay?"
3,SAM,Peter's bike.
3,JAKE,Who are you?
3,SAM,"Put the gun down, Jake."
3,JAKE,How did you know that was there?
3,DEAN,"What happened? You and Bill killed Peter, drowned him in the lake and then buried the bike? You can't bury the truth, Jake. Nothing stays buried."
3,ANDREA,"Go to your room, sweetie. Now. Lock the door and wait for me. Don't come out."
3,JAKE,I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
3,DEAN,You and Bill killed Peter Sweeney thirty-five years ago. That's what the hell I'm talking about.
3,ANDREA,Dad!
3,DEAN,And now you got one seriously pissed-off spirit.
3,SAM,"It's gonna take Andrea, Lucas, everyone you love. It's gonna drown them. And it's gonna drag their bodies God knows where, so you can feel the same pain Peter's mom felt. And then, after that, it's gonna take you, and it's not gonna stop until it does."
3,JAKE,"Yeah, and how do you know that?"
3,SAM,Because that's exactly what it did to Bill Carlton.
3,JAKE,"Listen to yourselves, both of you. You're insane."
3,DEAN,"I don't really give a rat's ass what you think of us. But if we're gonna bring down this spirit, we need to find the remains, salt them, and burn them into dust. Now tell me you buried Peter somewhere. Tell me you didn't just let him go in the lake."
3,PETER,Come play with me.
3,ANDREA,"Dad, is any of this true?"
3,JAKE,No. Don't listen to them. They're liars and they're dangerous.
3,ANDREA,"Something tried to drown me. Chris died on that lake. Dad, look at me."
3,ANDREA,Tell me you—you didn't kill anyone.
3,ANDREA,Oh my God.
3,JAKE,"Billy and I were at the lake. Peter was the smallest one. We always bullied him, but this time, it got rough. We were holding his head under the water. We didn't mean to. But we held him under too long and he drowned. We let the body go, and it sank."
3,JAKE,"Oh, Andrea, we were kids. We were so scared. It was a mistake. But, Andrea, to say that I have anything to do with these drownings, with Chris, because of some ghost? It's not rational."
3,DEAN,"All right, listen to me, all of you. We need to get you away from this lake, as far as we can, right now."
3,JAKE,Lucas!
3,PETER,Come play with me.
3,DEAN,Lucas!
3,ANDREA,"Lucas! Baby, stay where you are!"
3,ANDREA,Oh my God!
3,SAM,"Andrea, stay there!"
3,ANDREA,No! Lucas!
3,SAM,We'll get him! Just stay on the dock!
3,DEAN,Sam?
3,ANDREA,"Lucas, where are you?"
3,JAKE,"Peter, if you can hear me...please, Peter, I'm sorry. I'm so—I'm so sorry."
3,ANDREA,"Daddy, no!"
3,JAKE,"Peter. Lucas—he's, he's just a little boy. Please, it's not his fault, it's mine. Please take me."
3,DEAN,"Jake, no!"
3,JAKE,Just let it be over!
3,ANDREA,Daddy! Daddy! No!
3,ANDREA,No!
3,SAM,"Look, we're not gonna save everybody."
3,DEAN,I know.
3,ANDREA,"Sam, Dean."
3,DEAN,Hey.
3,ANDREA,"We're glad we caught you. We just, um, we made you lunch for the road."
3,ANDREA,Lucas insisted on making the sandwiches himself.
3,LUCAS,Can I give it to them now?
3,ANDREA,Of course.
3,DEAN,"Come on, Lucas, let's load this into the car."
3,SAM,How you holding up?
3,ANDREA,"It's just gonna take a long time to sort through everything, you know?"
3,SAM,"Andrea, I'm sorry."
3,ANDREA,"You saved my son. I can't ask for more than that. Dad loved me. He loved Lucas. No matter what he did, I just have to hold on to that."
3,DEAN,"All right, if you're gonna be talking now, this is a very important phrase, so I want you to repeat it one more time."
3,LUCAS,Zeppelin rules!
3,DEAN,That's right. Up high.
3,DEAN,"You take care of your mom, okay?"
3,LUCAS,All right.
3,ANDREA,Thank you.
3,DEAN,"Sam, move your ass. We're gonna run out of daylight before we hit the road."
4,JOHN,"Take your brother outside as fast as you can! Now, Dean, go!"
4,JOHN,Mary! No!
4,DEAN,Dad's on a hunting trip.
4,DEAN,And he hasn't been home in a few days.
4,SAM,I swore I was done hunting.
4,DEAN,I can't do this alone.
4,SAM,No!
4,SAM,We've got work to do.
4,DEAN,—most valuable possession—everything he knows about every evil thing is in here. I think he wants us to—
4,DEAN,The family business.
4,SAM,No. I gotta find Jessica's killer.
4,DEAN,"Sam, you know we're gonna find Dad, right?"
4,SAM,Yeah. I know.
4,INTERCOM,Thank you for flying United Britannia Airlines.
4,PHELPS,"It's that obvious, huh?"
4,PHELPS,"Wow. That's, uh, really reassuring. Thank you."
4,PILOT,Thanks.
4,CHUCK,"Amanda, how are you today?"
4,AMANDA,"I'm doing just fine, Chuck."
4,AMANDA,"Welcome aboard. 15C towards the back of the plane, on the right."
4,PASSENGER,Thank you.
4,AMANDA,"Have a nice flight, sir."
4,PHELPS,"Oh, I'm counting on it."
4,AMANDA,"Um...uh, 11F, that's the middle of the plane, on..."
4,AMANDA,...the left.
4,COPILOT,In just a few minutes our flight crew will begin room service in the cabin...
4,PHELPS,Excuse me. Do you know how long we've been up?
4,WOMAN,"Oh, uh..."
4,WOMAN,About forty minutes.
4,PHELPS,"Wow. Time really does fly, huh? Excuse me. I've got to stretch my legs."
4,MAX,"Hey, what the hell are you doing?!"
4,SAM,"Morning, sunshine."
4,DEAN,What time is it?
4,SAM,"Uh, it's about five forty-five."
4,DEAN,In the morning?
4,SAM,Yep.
4,DEAN,Where does the day go?
4,DEAN,Did you get any sleep last night?
4,SAM,"Yeah, I grabbed a couple hours."
4,DEAN,"Liar. 'Cause I was up at three, and you were watching a George Foreman infomercial."
4,SAM,"Hey, what can I say? It's riveting TV."
4,DEAN,When was the last time you got a good night's sleep?
4,SAM,"I don't know, a little while, I guess. It's not a big deal."
4,DEAN,"Yeah, it is."
4,SAM,"Look, I appreciate your concern—"
4,DEAN,"Oh, I'm not concerned about you. It's your job to keep my ass alive, so I need you sharp."
4,DEAN,"Seriously, are you still having nightmares about Jess?"
4,SAM,"Yeah. But it's not just her. It's everything. I just forgot, you know? This job. Man, it gets to you."
4,DEAN,You can't let it. You can't bring it home like that.
4,SAM,"So, what? All this it...never keeps you up at night?"
4,SAM,Never? You're never afraid?
4,DEAN,"No, not really."
4,DEAN,That's not fear. That is precaution.
4,SAM,"All right, whatever. I'm too tired to argue."
4,DEAN,Hello?
4,JERRY,"Dean, it's, uh, it's Jerry Panowski. You and your dad helped me out a couple years back."
4,DEAN,"Oh, right, yeah. Up in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, the poltergeist thing. It's not back, is it?"
4,JERRY,"No. No. Thank god, no. But it's something else, and...uh, I think it could be a lot worse."
4,DEAN,What is it?
4,JERRY,Can we talk in person?
4,JERRY,"Thanks for making the trip so quick. I ought to be doing you guys a favor, not the other way around. Dean and your dad really helped me out."
4,SAM,"Yeah, he told me. It was a poltergeist?"
4,JERRY,"Hey, nobody's talking to you. Keep walking. Damn right it was a poltergeist, practically tore our house apart. Tell you something, if it wasn't for you and your dad, I probably wouldn't be alive. Your dad said you were off at college. Is that right?"
4,SAM,"Yeah, I was. I'm—taking some time off."
4,JERRY,"Well, he was real proud of you. I could tell. He talked about you all the time."
4,SAM,He did?
4,JERRY,"Yeah, you bet he did. Oh, hey, you know I tried to get a hold of him, but I couldn't. How's he doing, anyway?"
4,DEAN,"He's, um, wrapped up in a job right now."
4,JERRY,"Well, we're missing the old man, but we get Sam. Even trade, huh?"
4,SAM,"No, not by a long shot."
4,JERRY,I got something I want you guys to hear.
4,JERRY,"I listened to this. And, well, it sounded like it was up your alley."
4,JERRY,Normally I wouldn't have access to this. It's the cockpit voice recorder for United Britannia flight 2485. It was one of ours.
4,RECORDING,"Mayday! Mayday! Repeat! This is United Britania 2485—immediate instruction help! United Britanis 2485, I copy your message—May be experiencing some mechanical failure..."
4,JERRY,"Took off from here, crashed about two hundred miles south. Now, they're saying mechanical failure. Cabin depressurized somehow. Nobody knows why. Over a hundred people on board. Only seven got out alive. Pilot was one. His name is Chuck Lambert. He's a good friend of mine. Chuck is, uh...well, he's pretty broken up about it. Like it was his fault."
4,SAM,You don't think it was?
4,JERRY,"No, I don't."
4,SAM,"Jerry, we're gonna need passenger manifests, um, a list of survivors."
4,JERRY,All right.
4,DEAN,"And, uh, any way we can take a look at the wreckage?"
4,JERRY,"The other stuff is no problem. But the wreckage...fellas, the NTSB has it locked down in an evidence warehouse. No way I've got that kind of clearance."
4,DEAN,No problem.
4,WOMAN,Hey
4,DEAN,Hi.
4,SAM,You've been in there forever.
4,DEAN,You can't rush perfection.
4,SAM,Homeland Security?
4,SAM,"That's pretty illegal, even for us."
4,DEAN,"Yeah, well, it's something new. You know? People haven't seen it a thousand times."
4,DEAN,"All right, so, what do you got?"
4,SAM,"Well, there's definitely EVP on the cockpit voice recorder."
4,DEAN,Yeah?
4,SAM,Listen.
4,VOICE,No survivors!
4,DEAN,"""No survivors""? What's that supposed to mean? There were seven survivors."
4,SAM,Got me.
4,DEAN,"So, what are you thinking? A haunted flight?"
4,SAM,"There's a long history of spirits and death omens on planes and ships, like phantom travelers."
4,DEAN,Mm-hmm.
4,SAM,Or remember flight 401?
4,DEAN,"Right. The one that crashed, the airline salvaged some of its parts, put it in other planes, then the spirit of the pilot and copilot haunted those flights."
4,SAM,Right.
4,DEAN,Yep.
4,SAM,Maybe we got a similar deal.
4,DEAN,"All right, so, survivors, which one do you want to talk to first?"
4,SAM,Third on the list: Max Jaffey.
4,DEAN,Why him?
4,SAM,"Well, for one, he's from around here. And two, if anyone saw anything weird, he did."
4,DEAN,What makes you say that?
4,SAM,"Well, I spoke to his mother."
4,MAX,I don't understand. I already spoke with Homeland Security.
4,DEAN,Right. Some new information has come up. So if you could just answer a couple questions...
4,SAM,"Just before the plane went down, did you notice anything...unusual?"
4,MAX,Like what?
4,DEAN,"Strange lights, weird noises, maybe. Voices."
4,MAX,"No, nothing."
4,DEAN,Mr. Joffey—
4,MAX,Jaffey.
4,DEAN,"Jaffey. You checked yourself in here, right?"
4,DEAN,Can I ask why?
4,MAX,I was a little stressed. I survived a plane crash.
4,DEAN,Uh huh. And that's what terrified you? That's what you were afraid of?
4,MAX,I...I don't want to talk about this anymore.
4,DEAN,"See, I think maybe you did see something up there. We need to know what."
4,MAX,"No. No, I was...delusional. Seeing things."
4,DEAN,He was seeing things.
4,DEAN,What?
4,MAX,"He opened the emergency exit. But that's...that's impossible, right? I mean, I looked it up. There's something like two tons of pressure on that door."
4,DEAN,Yeah.
4,SAM,"This man, uh, did he seem to appear and disappear rapidly? It would look something like a mirage?"
4,MAX,"What are you, nuts?"
4,MAX,He was a passenger. He was sitting right in front of me.
4,SAM,"So here we are. George Phelps, seat 20C."
4,DEAN,"Hmm. Man, I don't care how strong you are."
4,DEAN,"Even yoked up on PCP or something, no way you can open up an emergency door during a flight."
4,SAM,"Not if you're human. But maybe this guy George was something else. Some kind of creature, maybe, in human form."
4,DEAN,Does that look like a creature's lair to you?
4,SAM,This is your late husband?
4,DEAN,And you said he was a...dentist?
4,SAM,How long were you married?
4,SAM,"In all that time, did you ever notice anything...strange about him, anything out of the ordinary?"
4,SAM,I mean it goes without saying. It just doesn't make any sense.
4,DEAN,"A middle-aged dentist with an ulcer is not exactly evil personified. You know what we need to do is get inside that NTSB warehouse, check out the wreckage."
4,SAM,"Okay. But if we're gonna go that route, we'd better look the part."
4,DEAN,"Man, I look like one of the Blues Brothers."
4,SAM,"No, you don't. You look more like a...seventh-grader at his first dance."
4,DEAN,I hate this thing.
4,SAM,Hey. You want into that warehouse or not?
4,SAM,What is that?
4,DEAN,It's an EMF meter. Reads electromagnetic frequencies.
4,SAM,"Yeah, I know what an EMF meter is, but why does that one look like a busted-up walkman?"
4,DEAN,'Cause that's what I made it out of. It's homemade.
4,SAM,"Yeah, I can see that."
4,DEAN,Check out the emergency door handle.
4,DEAN,What is this stuff?
4,SAM,One way to find out.
4,AGENT,What are you talking about?
4,DEAN,"Well, these monkey suits do come in handy."
4,COPILOT,"Listen, Chuck. It's like getting back on a horse. Only in this case, a little twin engine. Not even a horse, more like a pony. I'll be right there with you too. Anytime you feel like you don't want the wheel, I'll take over. Look, Chuck, we don't have to do this today. I'm not trying to rush you."
4,CHUCK,"No, the...the waiting is worse."
4,COPILOT,"Okay, they're filling up the tank. Then we go."
4,JERRY,Huh. This stuff is covered in sulfur.
4,SAM,You're sure?
4,JERRY,Take a look for yourself.
4,MAN,You effin' piece of crap...
4,JERRY,"If you fellows will excuse me, I have an idiot to fire."
4,JERRY,"Hey. Einstein. Yeah, you. What the heck you doing? Put the wrench down—"
4,DEAN,"Hmm. You know, there's not too many things that leave behind a sulfuric residue."
4,SAM,Demonic possession?
4,DEAN,It would explain how a mortal man would have the strength to open up an emergency hatch.
4,SAM,"If the guy was possessed, it's possible."
4,DEAN,"This goes way beyond floating over a bed or barfing pea soup. I mean it's one thing to possess a person, but to use them to take down an entire airplane?"
4,SAM,You ever heard of something like this before?
4,DEAN,Never.
4,CHUCK,I'm ready. Let's do this.
4,COPILOT,How you feeling?
4,CHUCK,I feel great.
4,COPILOT,You'll be back flying jumbos before you know it.
4,CHUCK,I hope so. How long we been up?
4,COPILOT,Uh...almost forty minutes.
4,CHUCK,Wow. Time really does fly.
4,COPILOT,What are you doing?
4,SAM,"So, every religion in every world culture has the concept of demons and demonic possession, right? I mean Christian, Native American, Hindu, you name it."
4,DEAN,"Yeah, but none of them describe anything like this."
4,SAM,"Well, that's not exactly true. You see according to Japanese beliefs, certain demons are behind certain disasters, both natural and man-made. One causes earthquakes, another causes disease."
4,DEAN,And this one causes plane crashes?
4,DEAN,"All right, so, what? We have a demon that's evolved with the times and found a way to ratchet up the body count?"
4,SAM,"Yeah. You know, who knows how many planes it's brought down before this one?"
4,SAM,What?
4,DEAN,"I don't know, man. This isn't our normal gig. I mean, demons, they don't want anything, just death and destruction for its own sake. This is big. And I wish Dad was here."
4,SAM,Yeah. Me too.
4,DEAN,Hello?
4,JERRY,"Dean, it's Jerry."
4,DEAN,"Oh, hey, Jerry."
4,JERRY,My pilot friend...Chuck Lambert is dead.
4,DEAN,"Wha—Jerry, I'm sorry. What happened?"
4,JERRY,He and his buddy went up in a small twin about an hour ago. The plane went down.
4,DEAN,Where'd this happen?
4,JERRY,"About sixty miles west of here, near Nazareth."
4,DEAN,I'll try to ignore the irony in that.
4,JERRY,I'm sorry?
4,DEAN,"Nothing. Jerry, hang in there, all right? We'll catch up with you soon."
4,SAM,Another crash?
4,DEAN,Yeah. Let's go.
4,SAM,Where?
4,DEAN,Nazareth.
4,DEAN,Sulfur?
4,DEAN,"Well, that's great. All right, that's two plane crashes involving Chuck Lambert. This demon sounds like it was after him."
4,SAM,"With all due respect to Chuck, if that's the case, that would be the good news."
4,DEAN,What's the bad news?
4,SAM,"Chuck's plane went down exactly forty minutes into flight. And get this, so did flight 2485."
4,JERRY,Forty minutes? What does that mean?
4,DEAN,"It's biblical numerology. You know Noah's ark, it rained for forty days. The number means death."
4,SAM,"I went back, and there have been six plane crashes over the last decade that all went down exactly forty minutes in."
4,DEAN,Any survivors?
4,SAM,"No. Or not until now, at least, not until flight 2485, for some reason. On the cockpit voice recorder, remember what the EVP Said?"
4,DEAN,"""No survivors."""
4,DEAN,It's going after all the survivors. It's trying to finish the job.
4,SAM,"Really? Well, thank you for taking our survey, And if you do plan to fly, please don't forget your friends at United Britannia Airlines. Thanks."
4,SAM,All right. That takes care of Blaine Sanderson and Dennis Holloway. They're not flying anytime soon.
4,DEAN,So our only wildcard is the flight attendant Amanda Walker.
4,SAM,Right. Her sister Karen said her flight leaves Indianapolis at eight pm. It's her first night back on the job.
4,DEAN,That sounds like just our luck.
4,SAM,"Dean, this is a five-hour drive, man, even with you behind the wheel."
4,DEAN,"Call Amanda's cellphone again, see if we can't head her off at the pass."
4,SAM,I already left her three voice messages. She must have turned her cellphone off.
4,SAM,"God, we're never gonna make it."
4,DEAN,We'll make it.
4,SAM,Right there. They're boarding in thirty minutes.
4,DEAN,Okay. We still have some cards to play. We need to find a phone.
4,VOICE,Airport Services.
4,DEAN,Hi. Gate thirteen.
4,VOICE,"Who are you calling, sir?"
4,DEAN,"I'm trying to contact an Amanda Walker. She's a flight attendant on flight, um...flight 4-2-4."
4,DEAN,Come on.
4,AMANDA,This is Amanda Walker.
4,DEAN,"Miss Walker. Hi, this is Dr. James Hetfield from St. Francis Memorial Hospital. We have a Karen Walker here."
4,AMANDA,Karen?
4,DEAN,"Nothing serious, just a minor car accident, but she was injured, so—"
4,AMANDA,"Wa—wait, that's impossible. I just got off the phone with her."
4,DEAN,You what?
4,AMANDA,"Five minutes ago. She's at her house, cramming for a final. Who is this?"
4,DEAN,"Uh, well...there must be some mistake."
4,AMANDA,And how would you even know I was here?
4,AMANDA,Is this one of Vince's friends?
4,DEAN,Guilty as charged.
4,AMANDA,Wow. This is unbelievable.
4,DEAN,He's really sorry.
4,AMANDA,"Well, you tell him to mind his own business and stay out of my life, okay?"
4,DEAN,"Yes, but...he really needs to see you tonight, so—"
4,AMANDA,"No, I'm sorry. It's too late."
4,DEAN,Don't be like that. Come on. The guy's a mess. Really. It's pathetic.
4,AMANDA,Really?
4,DEAN,"Oh, yeah."
4,AMANDA,"Look, I've got to go. Um...tell him to call me when I land."
4,DEAN,"No, no. Wait, Amanda. Amanda!"
4,AMANDA,"How are you? Hey, Bob."
4,DEAN,Damn it! So close.
4,INTERCOM,Thank you for flying United Britannia Airlines.
4,SAM,"All right, it's time for plan B. We're getting on that plane."
4,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, now just hold on a second."
4,SAM,"Dean, that plane is leaving with over a hundred passengers on board, and if we're right, that plane is gonna crash."
4,DEAN,I know.
4,SAM,"Okay. So we're getting on the plane, we need to find that demon and exorcise it. I'll get the tickets. You get whatever you can out of the trunk. Whatever that will make it through the security. Meet me back here in five minutes."
4,SAM,Are you okay?
4,DEAN,"No, not really."
4,SAM,What? What's wrong?
4,DEAN,"Well, I kind of have this problem with, uh..."
4,SAM,Flying?
4,DEAN,It's never really been an issue until now.
4,SAM,"You're joking, right?"
4,DEAN,"Do I look like I'm joking? Why do you think I drive everywhere, Sam?"
4,SAM,"All right. Uh, I'll go."
4,DEAN,What?
4,SAM,I'll do this one on my own.
4,DEAN,"What are you, nuts? You said it yourself, the plane's gonna crash."
4,SAM,"Dean, we can do it together, or I can do this one by myself. I'm not seeing a third option, here."
4,DEAN,Come on! Really? Man...
4,INTERCOM,"Flight attendants, please cross-check doors before departure."
4,SAM,Just try to relax.
4,DEAN,Just try to shut up.
4,SAM,You're humming Metallica?
4,DEAN,Calms me down.
4,SAM,"Look, man, I get you're nervous, all right? But you got to stay focused."
4,DEAN,Okay.
4,SAM,"I mean, we got thirty-two minutes and counting to track this thing down, or whoever it's possessing, anyway, and perform a full-on exorcism."
4,DEAN,"Yeah, on a crowded plane. That's gonna be easy."
4,SAM,"Just take it one step at a time, all right? Now, who is it possessing?"
4,DEAN,"It's usually gonna be somebody with some sort of weakness, you know, a chink in the armor that the demon can worm through. Somebody with an addiction or some sort of emotional distress."
4,SAM,"Well, this is Amanda's first flight after the crash. If I were her, I'd be pretty messed up."
4,DEAN,Excuse me. Are you Amanda?
4,DEAN,"Oh, my mistake."
4,DEAN,"All right, well, that's got to be Amanda back there, so I'll go talk to her, and, uh, I'll get a read on her mental state."
4,SAM,What if she's already possessed?
4,DEAN,There's ways to test that.
4,DEAN,I brought holy water.
4,SAM,No.
4,SAM,"I think we can go more subtle. If she's possessed, she'll flinch at the name of God."
4,DEAN,Oh. Nice.
4,SAM,Hey.
4,DEAN,What?
4,SAM,Say it in Latin.
4,DEAN,I know.
4,SAM,Okay. Hey!
4,DEAN,What?!
4,SAM,"Uh, in Latin, it's ""Christo""."
4,DEAN,"Dude, I know! I'm not an idiot!"
4,COPILOT,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your first officer speaking..."
4,DEAN,Hi.
4,AMANDA,Hi. Can I help you with something?
4,DEAN,"Oh, no. I'm just a bit of an uneasy flier. It makes me feel better to walk around a little bit."
4,AMANDA,"Oh, it happens to the best of us."
4,DEAN,"Of course, you being a stewardess, I guess flying comes easy to you."
4,AMANDA,You'd be surprised.
4,DEAN,Really? You're a nervous flier?
4,AMANDA,"Yeah, maybe, little bit."
4,DEAN,"How is it that, being a stewardess, you're scared to fly?"
4,AMANDA,Kind of a long story.
4,DEAN,Right. I'm sorry for asking.
4,AMANDA,It's okay.
4,DEAN,You ever consider other employment?
4,AMANDA,"No. Look, everybody's scared of something. I just, uh...I'm not gonna let it hold me back."
4,DEAN,Huh.
4,AMANDA,So...
4,AMANDA,I'm sorry. Did you say something?
4,DEAN,Christo?
4,AMANDA,"I—I didn't, I didn't..."
4,DEAN,"Yeah, nothing. Never mind."
4,AMANDA,Okay.
4,DEAN,"All right, well, she's got to be the most well-adjusted person on the planet."
4,SAM,"You said ""Christo""?"
4,DEAN,Yeah.
4,SAM,And?
4,DEAN,There's no demon in her. There's no demon getting in her.
4,SAM,"So, if it's on the plane, it can be anyone. Anywhere."
4,DEAN,Come on! That can't be normal!
4,SAM,"Hey, hey, it's just a little turbulence."
4,DEAN,"Sam, this plane is going to crash, okay? So quit treating me like I'm friggin' four."
4,SAM,You need to calm down.
4,DEAN,"Well, I'm sorry I can't."
4,SAM,"Yes, you can."
4,DEAN,"Dude, stow the touchy-feely, self-help yoga crap, it's not helping."
4,SAM,"Listen, if you're panicked, you're wide open to demonic possession, so you need to calm yourself down. Right now."
4,SAM,"Good. Now, I found an exorcism in here that I think is gonna work. The Rituale Romanum."
4,DEAN,What do we have to do?
4,SAM,"It's two parts. The first part expels the demon from the victim's body. It makes it manifest, which actually makes it more powerful."
4,DEAN,More powerful?
4,SAM,Yeah.
4,DEAN,How?
4,SAM,"Well, it doesn't need to possess someone anymore. It can just wreak havoc on its own."
4,DEAN,Oh. And why is that a good thing?
4,SAM,"Well, because the second part sends the bastard back to hell once and for all."
4,DEAN,"First things first, we got to find it."
4,DEAN,Ah! Don't do that.
4,SAM,Anything?
4,DEAN,"No, nothing. How much time we got?"
4,SAM,Fifteen minutes. Maybe we missed somebody.
4,DEAN,Maybe the thing's just not on the plane.
4,SAM,You believe that?
4,DEAN,"Well, I will if you will."
4,SAM,What? What is it?
4,DEAN,Christo.
4,SAM,She's not gonna believe this.
4,DEAN,"Twelve minutes, dude."
4,AMANDA,"Oh, hi. Flight's not too bumpy for you, I hope."
4,DEAN,"Actually, that's kind of what we need to talk to you about."
4,AMANDA,"Um, okay. What can I do for you?"
4,DEAN,"All right, this is gonna sound nuts, but we just don't have time for the whole ""the truth is out there"" speech right now."
4,SAM,"All right, look, we know you were on flight 2485."
4,AMANDA,Who are you guys?
4,SAM,"Now, we've spoken to some of the other survivors. We know something brought down that plane and it wasn't a mechanical failure."
4,DEAN,We need your help because we need to stop it from happening again. Here. Now.
4,AMANDA,"I'm sorry, I—I'm very busy. I have to go back—"
4,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? But listen to me, uh...The pilot in 2485, Chuck Lambert. He's dead."
4,AMANDA,"Wait. What? What, Chuck is dead?"
4,DEAN,"He died in a plane crash. Now, that's two plane crashes in two months. That doesn't strike you as strange?"
4,AMANDA,I—
4,SAM,"Look, there was something wrong with 2485. Now maybe you sensed it, maybe you didn't. But there's something wrong with this flight, too."
4,DEAN,"Amanda, you have to believe us."
4,AMANDA,"On...on 2485, there was this man. He...had these eyes."
4,SAM,Yes. That's exactly what we're talking about.
4,AMANDA,"I don't understand, what are you asking me to do?"
4,DEAN,"Okay. The copilot, we need you to bring him back here."
4,AMANDA,Why? What does he have to do with anything?
4,DEAN,Don't have time to explain. We just need to talk to him. Okay?
4,AMANDA,How am I supposed to go in the cockpit and get the copilot—
4,SAM,"Do whatever it takes. Tell him there's something broken back here, whatever will get him out of that cockpit."
4,AMANDA,Do you know that I could lose my job if you—
4,DEAN,"Okay, well you're gonna lose a lot more if you don't help us out."
4,AMANDA,Okay.
4,COPILOT,"Yeah, what's the problem?"
4,AMANDA,Wait. What are you doing? You said you were just gonna talk to him.
4,DEAN,We are gonna talk to him.
4,AMANDA,"Oh, my god. What's wrong with him?"
4,SAM,Look. We need you calm. We need you outside the curtain.
4,AMANDA,"Well, I don't underst—I don't know—"
4,SAM,"Don't let anybody in, okay? Can you do that? Can you do that? Amanda?"
4,AMANDA,Okay. Okay.
4,DEAN,"Hurry up, Sam. I don't know how much longer I can hold him."
4,SAM,"Regna terrae, cantate Deo, psallite Domino—"
4,DEMON,"I know what happened to your girlfriend! She must have died screaming! Even now, she's burning!"
4,DEAN,Sam!
4,SAM,I got him.
4,SAM,Where'd it go?
4,DEAN,It's in the plane. Hurry up. We got to finish it.
4,COPILOT,"I don't know. I was walking through the airport, then it all goes blank. I don't even remember getting on the plane."
4,AMANDA,"No, that's all."
4,DEAN,Let's get out of here.
4,DEAN,You okay?
4,SAM,"Dean, it knew about Jessica."
4,DEAN,"Sam, these things, they, they read minds. They lie. All right? That's all it was."
4,SAM,Yeah.
4,DEAN,Come on.
4,JERRY,Your dad's gonna be real proud.
4,SAM,"We'll see you around, Jerry."
4,DEAN,"You know, Jerry."
4,JERRY,Yeah.
4,DEAN,"I meant to ask you, how did you get my cellphone number, anyway? I've only had it for like six months."
4,JERRY,Your dad gave it to me.
4,SAM,What?
4,DEAN,When did you talk to him?
4,JERRY,"I mean, I didn't exactly talk to him, but I called his number. His voice message said to give you a call. Thanks again, guys."
4,SAM,"This doesn't make any sense, man. I've called Dad's number like fifty times. It's been out of service."
4,JOHN,"This is John Winchester. I can't be reached. If this is an emergency, call my son, Dean. 785-555-0179. He can help."
4,SAM,"Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa."
4,SAM,Dean. We're about to walk into an airport?
4,DEAN,I feel naked.
5,JOHN,"Take your brother outside as fast as you can! Now, Dean, go!"
5,JOHN,Mary! No!
5,DEAN,Dad's on a hunting trip.
5,DEAN,And he hasn't been home in a few days.
5,SAM,I swore I was done hunting.
5,DEAN,I can't do this alone.
5,SAM,No!
5,SAM,We've got work to do.
5,DEAN,—most valuable possession—everything he knows about every evil thing is in here. I think he wants us to—
5,DEAN,The family business.
5,SAM,No. I gotta find Jessica's killer.
5,DEAN,"SAM, you know we're gonna find Dad, right?"
5,SAM,Yeah. I know.
5,LILY,Truth.
5,LILY,Dare.
5,LILY,Is that the best you can come up with?
5,LILY,I heard she was a lady killed in a car crash.
5,LILY,Because it isn't real.
5,LILY,Bloody Mary. This is so stupid. Bloody Mary.
5,LILY,Bloody Mary.
5,LILY,You guys are jerks.
5,STEVEN,Lily.
5,STEVEN,Do you mind keeping it down?
5,LILY,"Sorry, Daddy."
5,DONNA,"Hey, geek. You guys having fun?"
5,LILY,You're out past curfew.
5,DONNA,"Thanks, Dad."
5,JESS,"Why, Sam? Why, Sam?"
5,SAM,No!
5,JESS,"Why, Sam? Why, Sam?"
5,DEAN,"Sam, wake up."
5,SAM,I take it I was having a nightmare.
5,DEAN,"Yeah, another one."
5,SAM,"Hey, at least I got some sleep."
5,DEAN,"You know, sooner or later we're gonna have to talk about this."
5,SAM,Are we here?
5,DEAN,"Yup. Welcome to Toledo, Ohio."
5,SAM,So what do you think really happened to this guy?
5,DEAN,That's what we're gonna find out.
5,DEAN,Let's go.
5,DEAN,Hey.
5,DEAN,"Yeah. We're the, uh...med students."
5,DEAN,"Oh, Doctor—"
5,DEAN,—Figlavitch didn't tell you?
5,DEAN,"We talked to him on the phone. He, uh, we're from Ohio State."
5,DEAN,He's supposed to show us the Shoemaker corpse. It's for our paper.
5,DEAN,"Oh well he said, uh—"
5,DEAN,"—oh, well, you know, it doesn't matter. You don't mind just showing us the body, do you?"
5,DEAN,An hour? Ooh. We gotta be heading back to Columbus by then.
5,SAM,Yeah.
5,DEAN,"Uh, look, man, this paper's like half our grade, so if you don't mind helping us out—"
5,DEAN,I'm gonna hit him in his face I swear.
5,DEAN,"Dude, I earned that money."
5,SAM,You won it in a poker game.
5,DEAN,Yeah.
5,SAM,Now the newspaper said his daughter found him. She said his eyes were bleeding.
5,DEAN,Any sign of a struggle? Maybe somebody did it to him?
5,SAM,What's the official cause of death.
5,SAM,What do you mean?
5,SAM,The eyes&mash;what would cause something like that?
5,DEAN,Yeah? You ever see exploding eyeballs?
5,DEAN,"Hey, think we could take a look at that police report? You know for, uh...our paper."
5,SAM,Might not be one of ours. Might just be some freak medical thing.
5,DEAN,How many times in Dad's long and varied career has it actually been a freak medical thing and not some sign of an awful supernatural death?
5,SAM,"Uh, almost never."
5,DEAN,Exactly.
5,SAM,"All right, let's go talk to the daughter."
5,DEAN,Feel like we're underdressed.
5,DEAN,"You must be Donna, right?"
5,DONNA,Yeah.
5,SAM,"Hi, uh—we're really sorry."
5,DONNA,Thank you.
5,SAM,"I'm Sam, this is Dean. We worked with your dad."
5,DONNA,You did?
5,DEAN,"Yeah. This whole thing. I mean, a stroke."
5,CHARLIE,I don't think she really wants to talk about this right now
5,DONNA,It's okay. I'm okay.
5,DEAN,Were there any symptoms? Dizziness? Migraines?
5,DONNA,No.
5,LILY,That's because it wasn't a stroke.
5,DONNA,"Lily, don't say that."
5,SAM,What?
5,DONNA,"I'm sorry, she's just upset."
5,LILY,"No, it happened because of me."
5,DONNA,"Sweetie, it didn't."
5,SAM,Lily.
5,SAM,Why would you say something like that?
5,LILY,"Right before he died, I said it."
5,SAM,You said what?
5,LILY,"Bloody Mary, three times in the bathroom mirror."
5,LILY,"She took his eyes, that's what she does."
5,DONNA,That's not why Dad died. This isn't your fault.
5,DEAN,"I think your sister's right, Lily. There's no way it could have been Bloody Mary. Your dad didn't say it, did he?"
5,LILY,"No, I don't think so."
5,SAM,The Bloody Mary legend...Dad ever find any evidence that it was a real thing?
5,DEAN,Not that I know of.
5,SAM,"I mean, everywhere else all over the country, kids will play Bloody Mary, and as far as we know, nobody dies from it."
5,DEAN,"Yeah, well, maybe everywhere it's just a story, but here it's actually happening."
5,SAM,The place where the legend began?
5,SAM,"But according to the legend, the person who says B—"
5,SAM,The person who says you know what gets it. But here—
5,DEAN,"Shoemaker gets it instead, yeah."
5,SAM,Right.
5,DEAN,"Never heard anything like that before. Still, the guy did die right in front of the mirror, and the daughter's right. The way the legend goes, you know who scratches your eyes out."
5,SAM,It's worth checking in to.
5,CHARLIE,What are you doing up here?
5,DEAN,"We—we, had to go to the bathroom."
5,CHARLIE,Who are you?
5,DEAN,"Like we said downstairs, we worked with Donna's dad."
5,CHARLIE,He was a day trader or something. He worked by himself.
5,DEAN,"No, I know, I meant—"
5,CHARLIE,"And all those weird questions downstairs, what was that? So you tell me what's going on, or I start screaming."
5,SAM,"All right, all right. We think something happened to Donna's dad."
5,CHARLIE,"Yeah, a stroke."
5,SAM,That's not a sign of a typical stroke. We think it might be something else.
5,CHARLIE,Like what?
5,SAM,Honestly? We don't know yet. But we don't want it to happen to anyone else. That's the truth.
5,DEAN,"So, if you're gonna scream, go right ahead."
5,CHARLIE,"Who are you, cops?"
5,DEAN,Something like that.
5,SAM,I'll tell you what. Here.
5,SAM,"If you think of anything, you or your friends notice anything strange, out of the ordinary...just give us a call."
5,DEAN,"All right, say Bloody Mary really is haunting this town. There's gonna be some sort of proof—Like a local woman who died nasty."
5,SAM,"Yeah but a legend this widespread it's hard. I mean, there's like 50 versions of who she actually is. One story says she's a witch, another says she's a mutilated bride, there's a lot more. {They walk in to the actual library.}"
5,DEAN,All right so what are we supposed to be looking for?
5,SAM,"Every version's got a few things in common. It's always a woman named Mary, and she always dies right in front of a mirror. So we've gotta search local newspapers—public records as far back as they go. See if we can find a Mary who fits the bill."
5,DEAN,Well that sounds annoying.
5,SAM,"No it won't be so bad, as long as we...{He looks at the computers which all say ""Out of Order"" on them.} *chuckles* I take it back. This will be very annoying."
5,Charlie,I'm not sure. They were cops or detectives or something.
5,Jill,"Whoever they were, they were cute."
5,Charlie,Jill
5,Jill,You didn't think so?
5,Charlie,"Yeah okay they were cute. Still, do you think something happened to DONNA's dad?"
5,Jill,Maybe LILY was right. Maybe Bloody Mary got him.
5,Charlie,"Ha ha, very funny."
5,Jill,"Wait, I'm sorry. Was that fear I hear in your voice?"
5,Charlie,No.
5,Jill,"Charlie, I'm walking to the bathroom mirror right now."
5,Charlie,"Jill, quit it."
5,Jill,"{She gets to her bathroom mirror.} Oh no, I can't help myself. I'm gonna say it. Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary."
5,Charlie,{There is a silence on the phone.} Jill? {Jill screams.} Jill!?!
5,Jill,"{Starts laughing} You're such a freak, I'll call you tomorrow. {They hang up the phone and Jill goes to her closet to finish getting changed. She opens the door, and on the inside there is a mirror, where we see Bloody Mary. She closes the closet door and goes to sit down at her vanity, where of course there is another mirror. We see Bloody Mary as she takes her earrings out, and then her reflection again when Jill walks in front of her TV screen. Jill goes back in the bathroom to wash her face, but as she bends down to wash, her reflection in the mirror stays standing. She looks up and sees her reflection looking at her as if it were another person. Jill starts panicking as the reflection in the mirror starts oozing blood out of its eyes. She reaches up and feels blood on her own face.}"
5,Reflection,You did it. You killed that boy.
5,SAM,Why'd you let me fall asleep?
5,DEAN,Cause I'm an awesome brother. So what did you dream about?
5,SAM,Lollipops and candy canes.
5,DEAN,"Yeah, sure."
5,SAM,Did you find anything?
5,DEAN,"Oh besides a whole new level of frustration? {SAM sits up.} No. I've looked at everything. A few local women, a Laura and a Catherine committed suicide in front of a mirror, and a giant mirror fell on a guy named Dave, but uh, no Mary."
5,SAM,{Falls back on the bed.} Maybe we just haven't found it yet.
5,DEAN,"I've also been searching for strange deaths in the area, you know...eyeball bleeding, that sort of thing. There's nothing. Whatever's happening here, maybe it just ain't Mary."
5,SAM,"Hello? {We do not hear who is calling, but a look of concern comes across SAM's face.}"
5,Charlie,And they found her on the bathroom floor. And her—her eyes. They were gone.
5,SAM,I'm sorry.
5,Charlie,"And she said it. {DEAN looks up at SAM.} I heard her say it. But it couldn't be because of that. I'm insane, right?"
5,DEAN,"No, you're not insane."
5,Charlie,"Oh God, that makes me feel so much worse."
5,SAM,Look. We think something's happening here. Something that can't be explained.
5,DEAN,And we're gonna stop it but we could use your help.
5,SAM,What did you tell Jill's mom?
5,Charlie,Just that I needed some time alone with Jill's pictures and things. {SAM pulls something out of the bag and DEAN shuts the curtains.} I hate lying to her.
5,DEAN,"Trust us, this is for the greater good. Hit the lights."
5,Charlie,{goes over to turn off the lights.} What are you guys looking for?
5,DEAN,We'll let you know as soon as we find it.
5,SAM,"{has a digital camera ready, and hands it to DEAN.} Hey, night vision. {DEAN turns on the night vision for him.} Perfect."
5,DEAN,Do I look like Paris Hilton?
5,SAM,"So I don't get it. I mean...the first victim didn't summon Mary, and the second victim did. How's she choosing them?"
5,DEAN,Beats me.
5,DEAN,I want to know why Jill said it in the first place.
5,Charlie,It's just a joke.
5,DEAN,"Yeah well somebody's gonna say it again, it's just a matter of time."
5,SAM,"Hey. {DEAN and Charlie turn to look at him.} There's a black light in the trunk, right?"
5,Charlie,Gary Bryman?
5,SAM,You know who that is?
5,Charlie,No.
5,SAM,"So, Gary Bryman was an 8-year-old boy. Two years ago he was killed in a hit and run. The car was described as a black Toyota Camry. But nobody got the plates or saw the driver."
5,Charlie,Oh my God.
5,SAM,What?
5,Charlie,Jill drove that car.
5,DEAN,We need to get back to your friend DONNA's house.
5,SAM,Linda Shoemaker.
5,DONNA,Why are you asking me this?
5,SAM,"Look, we're sorry, but it's important."
5,DONNA,"Yeah. Linda's my mom okay? She overdosed on sleeping pills, it was an accident, and that's it. I think you should leave."
5,DEAN,"Now DONNA, just listen."
5,DONNA,Get out of my house! {she runs upstairs.}
5,Charlie,Oh my God. Do you really think her dad could've killed her mom?
5,SAM,Maybe.
5,Charlie,I think I should stick around.
5,DEAN,"All right. Whatever you do, don't—"
5,Charlie,"Believe me, I won't say it."
5,SAM,"Wait, wait, wait, you're doing a nationwide search?"
5,DEAN,"Yep. The NCIC, the FBI database—at this point any Mary who died in front of a mirror is good enough for me."
5,SAM,"But if she's haunting the town, she should have died in the town."
5,DEAN,"I'm telling you there's nothing local, I've checked. So unless you got a better idea—"
5,SAM,"The way Mary's choosing her victims, it seems like there's a pattern."
5,DEAN,"I know, I was thinking the SAMe thing."
5,SAM,With mister Shoemaker and Jill's hit and run.
5,DEAN,Both had secrets where people died.
5,SAM,"Right. I mean there's a lot of folklore about mirrors-that they reveal all your lies, all your secrets, that they're a true reflection of your soul, which is why it's bad luck to break them."
5,DEAN,"Right, right. So maybe if you've got a secret, I mean like a really nasty one where someone died, then Mary sees it, and punishes you for it."
5,SAM,Whether you're the one that summoned her or not.
5,DEAN,"Take a look at this. {Cut to a picture of a woman lying by a mirror in a puddle of blood. DEAN prints out another picture and hands it to SAM. The picture is of a handprint and the letters ""Tre""}"
5,SAM,Looks like the SAMe handprint.
5,DEAN,"Her name was Mary Worthington—an unsolved murder in Fort Wayne, Indiana."
5,Detective,"I was on the job for 35 years-detective for most of that. Now everybody packs it in with a few loose ends, but the Mary Worthington murder—that one still gets me."
5,DEAN,What exactly happened?
5,Detective,You boys said you were reporters?
5,SAM,"We know Mary was 19, lived by herself. We know she won a few local beauty contests, dreamt of getting out of Indiana, being an actress. And we know the night of March 29th someone broke into her apartment and murdered her, cut out her eyes with a knife."
5,Detective,That's right.
5,SAM,"See sir, when we asked you what happened, we wanted to know what you think happened."
5,Detective,Technically I'm not supposed to have a copy of this. {He opens a file to the picture SAM and DEAN found on the computer.} Now see that there? T-R-E?
5,DEAN,Yeah.
5,Detective,I think Mary was trying to spell out the name of her killer.
5,SAM,You know who it was?
5,Detective,"Not for sure. But there was a local man, a surgeon-Trevor SAMpson. {He pulls out a picture of a man.} And I think her cut her up good."
5,SAM,Now why would he do something like that?
5,Detective,"Her diary mentioned a man that she was seeing. She called him by his initial, ""T"". Well, her last entry, she was gonna tell ""T""'s wife about their affair."
5,DEAN,Yeah but how do you know it was SAMpson who killed her?
5,Detective,"It's hard to say, but the way her eyes were cut out...it was almost professional."
5,DEAN,But you could never prove it?
5,Detective,"No. No prints, no witnesses. He was meticulous."
5,DEAN,Is he still alive?
5,Detective,"Nope. {sits down and sighs} If you ask me, Mary spent her last living moments trying to expose this guy's secret. But she never could."
5,SAM,Where's she buried?
5,Detective,She wasn't. She was cremated.
5,DEAN,What about that mirror {nods at the one in the picture}. It's not in some evidence lockup somewhere is it?
5,Detective,"Ah, no. It was returned to Mary's family a long time ago."
5,SAM,You have the names of her family by any chance?
5,DONNA,"I mean, you bring these strangers into my house and they ask me things like that?"
5,Charlie,"They were only trying to help. Please, DONNA, you have to believe me."
5,DONNA,What? About Bloody Mary? {Of course they have now stopped in front of the mirror.}
5,Charlie,"Please, I know it sounds crazy—"
5,DONNA,"Crazy doesn't even begin to cover it. I mean it's one thing for my sister to believe this crap, she's 12. But you?"
5,Charlie,"Think about the way your dad died, okay? And the way Jill died."
5,DONNA,Okay so {she turns to face the mirror} Bloody Mary.
5,Charlie,No!
5,DONNA,Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. {She turns back to face Charlie} See? Nothing happened.
5,Charlie,Why would you do that?
5,DONNA,Oh my God. There really is something wrong with you.
5,Teacher,"Elements that loose electrons become positive ions, which are smaller than other atoms of the SAMe element. {Charlie opens up her compact.} Therefore the ionic radius is smaller than the atomic radius. {Charlie sees Bloody Mary in the corner and screams. The class freaks out as she starts running around the room.} Charlie! {She sees the reflection of Mary in the window of the door, picks up a stool, and throws it through the window.} Charlie!!! {The teacher catches Charlie.} Charlie stop it! What's wrong!? Just calm down.{Charlie sees Mary in the reflection of the teacher's glasses.}"
5,Charlie,Aah! Let me go!
5,Teacher,Charlie! {Charlie runs out of the room.}
5,SAM,"Oh really? Ah that's too bad Mr. Worthington. I would have paid a lot for that mirror. Okay, well maybe next time. All right, thanks. {SAM hangs up.}"
5,DEAN,So?
5,SAM,"So that was Mary's brother. The mirror was in the family for years, until he sold it one week ago to a store called Estate Antiques. A store in Toledo."
5,DEAN,"So wherever the mirror goes, that's where Mary goes?"
5,SAM,Her spirit's definitely tied up with it somehow.
5,DEAN,Isn't there an old superstition that says mirrors can capture spirits?
5,SAM,"Yeah there is. Yeah, when someone would die in a house people would cover up the mirrors so the ghost wouldn't get trapped."
5,DEAN,"So Mary dies in front of a mirror, and it draws in her spirit."
5,SAM,Yeah but how could she move through like a hundred different mirrors?
5,DEAN,"I don't know, but if the mirror is the source, I say we find it and smash it."
5,SAM,"Yeah, I don't know, maybe. {SAM's cell phone rings.} Hello. {The look of concern comes across his face again} Charlie?"
5,SAM,"{Sits next to Charlie} Hey, hey it's ok. Hey, you can open up your eyes Charlie. It's okay, all right?"
5,SAM,"Now listen. You're gonna stay right here on this bed, and you're not gonna look at glass, or anything else that has a reflection, okay? And as long as you do that, she cannot get you."
5,Charlie,"But I can't keep that up forever. I'm gonna die, aren't I?"
5,SAM,No. No. Not anytime soon.
5,DEAN,{Sits on the bed too} All right Charlie. We need to know what happened.
5,Charlie,We were in the bathroom. DONNA said it.
5,DEAN,"That's not what we're talking about. Something happened, didn't it? In your life...a secret...where someone got hurt. Can you tell us about it?"
5,Charlie,"I had this boyfriend. I loved him. But he kind of scared me too, you know? And one night, at his house, we got in this fight. Then I broke up with him, and he got upset, and he said he needed me and he loved me, and he said ""Charlie, if you walk out that door right now, I'm gonna kill myself."" And you know what I said? I said ""Go ahead."" And I left. How could I say that? How could I leave him like that? I just...I didn't believe him, you know? I should have. {She puts her face back on her knees and starts crying again.}"
5,DEAN,"You know her boyfriend killing himself, that's not really Charlie's fault."
5,SAM,"You know as well as I do spirits don't exactly see shades of gray, DEAN. Charlie had a secret, someone died, that's good enough for Mary."
5,DEAN,I guess.
5,SAM,"You know, I've been thinking. It might not be enough to just smash that mirror."
5,DEAN,"Why, what do you mean?"
5,SAM,"Well Mary's hard to pin down, right? I mean she moves around from mirror to mirror so who's to say that she's not just gonna keep hiding in them forever? So maybe we should try to pin her down, you know, summon her to her mirror and then smash it."
5,DEAN,Well how do you know that's going to work?
5,SAM,"I don't, not for sure."
5,DEAN,Well who's gonna summon her?
5,SAM,I will. She'll come after me.
5,DEAN,"You know what, that's it. {He pulls the car over.} This is about Jessica, isn't it? You think that's your dirty little secret that you killed her somehow? SAM, this has got to stop, man. I mean, the nightmares and calling her name out in the middle of the night—it's gonna kill you. Now listen to me—It wasn't your fault. If you wanna blame something, then blame the thing that killed her. Or hell, why don't you take a swing at me? I mean I'm the one that dragged you away from her in the first place."
5,SAM,I don't blame you.
5,DEAN,"Well you shouldn't blame yourself, because there's nothing you could've done."
5,SAM,I could've warned her.
5,DEAN,"About what? You didn't know what was gonna happen! And besides, all of this isn't a secret, I mean I know all about it. It's not gonna work with Mary anyway."
5,SAM,No you don't.
5,DEAN,I don't what?
5,SAM,You don't know all about it. I haven't told you everything.
5,DEAN,What are you talking about?
5,SAM,"Well it wouldn't really be a secret if I told you, would it?"
5,DEAN,"{looks surprised} No. I don't like it. It's not gonna happen, forget it."
5,SAM,DEAN that girl back there is going to die unless we do something about it. And you know what? Who knows how many more people are gonna die after that? Now we're doing this. You've got to let me do this.
5,DEAN,Well...that's just great. {He pulls out the picture of Mary's dead body to look at the mirror.} All right let's start looking.
5,DEAN,Maybe they've already sold it.
5,SAM,I don't think so.
5,DEAN,That's it. {sighs} You sure about this? {SAM hands DEAN the flashlight.}
5,SAM,{sighs} Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. {he looks at DEAN who gives him an unsure look back. SAM picks up the crowbar} Bloody Mary.
5,DEAN,"I'll go check that out. Stay here, be careful. {SAM readies the crowbar again} Smash anything that moves. {DEAN crawls away towards the front door. He sees a headlight.} Crap. {He puts the crowbar down and begins to walk to the door.}"
5,Police,Hold it.
5,DEAN,"Whoa guys, false alarm, I tripped the system."
5,Police,Who are you?
5,DEAN,I'm the boss's kid.
5,Police,You're Mister Yamashiro's kid?
5,SAM,Come on. Come into this one.
5,Reflection,It's your fault. You killed her. You killed Jessica.
5,DEAN,"Like I said, I was adopted."
5,Police,Yeah.
5,DEAN,"{Is being covered back and front by the two cops.} You know, I just—I really don't have time for this right now. {He punches one cop, backhands the other, then punches the cop in front of him again. They are now on the ground."
5,Reflection,"You never told her the truth—who you really were. {SAM is now falling towards the ground.} But it's more than that, isn't it? Those nightmares you've been having of Jessica dying, screaming, burning—You had them for days before she died. Didn't you!?! You were so desperate to ignore them, to believe they were just dreams. How could you ignore them like that? How could you leave her alone to die!?! You dreamt it would happen!!!"
5,DEAN,"{bends down to the floor to SAM} SAM, SAMmy!"
5,SAM,It's SAM.
5,DEAN,"[in reference to the blood that had come out of his eyes] God, are you okay?"
5,SAM,"Uh, yeah."
5,DEAN,"Come on, come on. {He pulls SAM up. He puts SAM's arm over his neck, and they begin to walk out, until Mary (again, much like SAMara coming out of the TV in The Ring) comes out of the frame of the mirror. They turn around to see her crawling over the broken glass. May walks towards them and they both fall to the ground. They both start bleeding from the face, but DEAN reaches up and pulls over a mirror so that Mary is forced to see her own reflection.}"
5,Reflection,You killed them! All those people! You killed them!
5,DEAN,Hey SAM?
5,SAM,Yeah?
5,DEAN,This has got to be like...what? 600 years of bad luck?
5,Charlie,So this is really over?
5,DEAN,"{nods} Yeah, it's over."
5,Charlie,"Thank you. {DEAN reaches back to shake her hand, and she gets out of the car.}"
5,SAM,"Charlie? {Charlie turns around} Your boyfriend's death...you really should try to forgive yourself. No matter what you did, you probably couldn't have stopped it. Sometimes bad things just happen."
5,DEAN,{Gently hits SAM} That's good advice. {They drive off} Hey SAM?
5,SAM,Yeah?
5,DEAN,"Now that this is all over, I want you to tell me what that secret is."
5,SAM,"Look...you're my brother and I'd die for you, but there are some things I need to keep to myself. {SAM looks out the window and sees Jessica in a white dress on the street corner standing next to a light pole, as they turn the corner she disappears behind the pole, and we don't see her again.}"
10,.....................,
12,SAM,"(looking upset) Dean, the guy probably would've died anyway. And someone else would've been healed."
12,SAM,(into phone) Dean it didn't work.The reaper's still coming!
18,MICHAEL,You said you were a big brother.
19,PROPRIETOR,"Let's look. Ahh...(begins reading) ""People who knew him describe Isaiah as having a stern and harsh temperament. Controlled his family with an iron fist. Wife, uh, two sons, adopted daughter...."""
19,DEAN,"(Giving SAM a totally blank look) I don't....know. uhh...I'm still waiting for the movie on that one. Anyway, we gotta get back in and see that painting."
19,SARAH,Yeah.
33,CHARLIE,"Doesn't make it right though, does it?"
36,CROWLEY,Hmm. (looking up at DEAN) Not my type.
76,ROWENA,"Finding someone. I'd thought I'd met my match. His name was Ben, but it didn't work out. We weren't sexually... It was like riding a heavily-sedated walrus. So, once again, I find myself in search of lasting love."
81,ROWENA,He never told me that.
82,MICK,Let's go.
85,EILEEN,It's Kelly Kline. I think I found her.
89,TONI,I knew they had a way to set this trap. I didn't know that I'd be in it.
90,KETCH,"Hello, love."
91,DEAN,You won't.
94,DEAN,Sam's living in a dream world.
102,DOUG,"Aw, jeeze."
109,LUCIFER,(shaky breath) I don't know.
112,CAS,"Dean, you can’t possibly eat another.  That’s your seventh piece."
112,JACK,Castiel’s right. I counted.
112,DEAN,It’s not even a whole pie.
112,JACK,Was he always like this?
112,DEAN,Mm.
112,SAM,"Thanks Mom.  You know what, let me help you."
112,SAM,"Hey, Mom, um, how you holding up? You haven’t really said much since you got back, you know -- how you’re doing.  How it was over there and..."
112,MARY,"It was hard. But somehow, I always knew that you... you and Dean would come and save us.  And you did."
112,SAM,Mom?
112,MARY,"Yes, Sam? Sam? (her voice has become robotic)"
112,MARY,Sam? Sam? Sam? (beeping of an alarm begins to accompany each word)
112,DEAN,Ow.
112,SAM,Hey. How’s Gabriel.
112,CAS,He said he needed a minute alone.  He wanted to extract his grace by himself.  (using air quote) In private.
112,CAS,So I left him alone in Dean’s room.
112,ROWENA,"I hate to interrupt, but I can’t be the only one to noticed the rather glaring hole in this plan."
112,CAS,She’s right.  The clock may run out on us.
112,SAM,Yeah.  It might.
112,DEAN,"Yeah, well we don’t have any better ideas."
112,ROWENA,"Mm, that’s inspirational."
112,GABRIEL,Here it is!  The final ingredient -- a fresh serving of archangel grace.
112,ROWENA,This is what you call a serving?
112,GABRIEL,That is the jet fuel of divine emissions.
112,CAS,"Okay, everyone ready?"
112,SAM,"Yeah, all right."
112,DEAN,Let’s do this.
112,DEAN,Okay.
112,CAS,"Well, that was...fast."
112,SAM,"Very, very fast."
112,SAM,"All right, great.  What do we do now?"
112,DEAN,Hell if I know.
112,CAS,You do know.  We all do. [Rowena shoots a frightened glance at Sam.]
112,CAS,"We need archangel grace. Gabriel’s obviously running a little low, and we don’t know how long it’ll take him to recover.  So that leaves exactly one source on Earth."
112,SAM,No.
112,CAS,"I don’t like it either, but there is no other way."
112,CAS,We need Lucifer.
112,SAM,"Obviously, I want to get Mom and Jack back.  It’s all I want. It’s all I can think about.  But we’ve been down this road before.  Teaming up with Lucifer --"
112,DEAN,We’re not teaming up with him.
112,CAS,We just need his grace.
112,DEAN,We’ve trapped his ass before.
112,GABRIEL,It’s not always like that.
112,GABRIEL,Just ’cause I take a little extra time to recover --
112,GABRIEL,It doesn’t make me any less of an archangel.
112,GABRIEL,"You know, it could have been you…"
112,ROWENA,Uh?
112,GABRIEL,…who screwed up that spell.
112,GABRIEL,"Just sayin’.  I heard your, uh, magical unbinding didn’t take, that you got knocked back down a peg.  Maybe it’s you who are off your game."
112,GABRIEL,Think they’ll be much longer?
112,ROWENA,"The Three Amigos?  With their bro hugs, pep talks, and melodrama?  Count on it."
112,ROWENA,Mm.
112,ROWENA,How would you like to fill it?
112,GABRIEL,To fill what?
112,ROWENA,I know a thing or two about wounded masculine pride.
112,DEAN,So?
112,SAM,"No, you’re right.  You’re right.  I don’t like it, but it’s our only choice.  Another fun, great choice. (said sarcastically, but he seems anxious)"
112,DEAN,"Well, hey, bright side is, even if we do pull it off, we still only get 24 hours in the Apocalypse world.  And Rowena’s right.  We’ll be lucky to even hear a word of Mom and Jack, much less save ’em, so…"
112,SAM,Wait a second.
112,DEAN,Guys?
112,ROWENA,Uh…we were just…
112,GABRIEL,"Reading.  Books.  Here in the, uh, library."
112,GABRIEL,Which is the room we’re in right now.
112,LUCIFER,"Keep  em comin’, pal, keep em comin’."
112,LUCIFER,"Yeah, it’s more like a curse.  Believe it or not, I’m barely even buzzed."
112,BARTENDER,"Still, that can’t be good for you."
112,BARTENDER,Okay.
112,BARTENDER,Sorry to hear that.  But I’m sure things will work out in the end.  Jack will come around.
112,LUCIFER,Jack?  I never told you his name.
112,BARTENDER,You didn’t?
112,LUCIFER,Nah. Didn’t.
112,BARTENDER,"Ah, I swear that you did."
112,BARTENDER,"Yeah.  Kinda spiked your drink.  Think of it as a magical roofie -- powerful enough to bring down any archangel, even me."
112,GABRIEL,"Hey, brother."
112,LUCIFER,I killed you.
112,GABRIEL,Welcome back.
112,LUCIFER,"Okay.  What in the hell did you put in that drink, man?"
112,LUCIFER,"Oh, hey, Sam."
112,LUCIFER,"Oh, look at this.  All the people I love to torture in the same room."
112,LUCIFER,"What’s the occasion, guys?"
112,LUCIFER,"Ah. Okay, I think I see what’s going on.  You’re planning a trip to save mother Mary, and you need my grace.  Is that about it?"
112,CAS,Good guess.
112,SAM,"Nah, those are just bonuses.  See, we got a lot of work to do back in Apocalypse world, but not a whole lot of time to do it.  So I realized something.  I realized we could use you."
112,ROWENA,Koth Munto Nuntox!
112,SAM,"And then, when we get back, then we’ll kill you."
112,ROWENA,Aye.  Someone needs to keep an eye on the Devil.  Go. Save your mum.
112,SAM,Ready.
112,GABRIEL,Ow!
112,SAM,"Okay.  Let’s get our bearings and head that way.  Cas, where are we?"
112,SAM,All right.
112,LUCIFER,"I don’t know, Red. I think I’d be a tad insulted if I were you. It’s not like you’ve got the posh job here of babysitting me."
112,ROWENA,"Mm.  Sorry, Lucille, I’m not biting."
112,LUCIFER,Okay.
112,CAS,"Have you, uh have you thought about what’s next, after we get back to earth?"
112,GABRIEL,"Uh, yeah, not so much,  seeing as we still gotta find Jack and Mary.  Ah, not to mention survive Michael and his super angel army."
112,CAS,Right.
112,GABRIEL,"Although, I did tick off some, uh, bucket list items recently.  Got some revenge.  Had sex with a 300-year-old redhead.  But what’s next for me? I don’t really know."
112,CAS,"This world is, um, is obviously glutted with angels, but back home in our world you know it’s -- it’s just Naomi and a handful of others.  They’re trying to keep the lights on, but Heaven’s dying, Gabriel."
112,GABRIEL,You serious?
112,CAS,Very.
112,GABRIEL,"And you think I could fix it?  Yeesh. I skipped out on Heaven, Castiel.  They wouldn’t want me back.  As far as they’re concerned, I’m a screw-up.  Hell, as far as I’m concerned, I’m a screw-up."
112,CAS,"Well, Heaven’s been run into the ground by upstanding angels.  Perhaps a screw-up is just the change we need."
112,SAM,Really?
112,DEAN,"Yeah, like you’re lighter, happier, more energetic."
112,DEAN,What the Hell was that thing?
112,MAGGIE,What do you mean? A vampire.
112,SAM,It’s not like any vamp we’ve ever seen.
112,MAGGIE,Who are you?
112,SAM,"I’m Sam.  Uh, Dean, Gabriel and Cas. (pointing to each man with the tip of his bloody machete)  We uh…"
112,MAGGIE,Which way you headed?
112,DEAN,North.
112,MAGGIE,"To Dayton?  We were going that way too.  We heard the rebels, Jack and Mary, set up a satellite colony there, an outpost."
112,SAM,Wait.  What do you mean you were?
112,MAGGIE,"Me, Floyd (the bearded man) the rest of our group, we were crossing north through the Morehead tunnel...stumbled into a whole nest of those things."
112,FLOYD,Nine of us went in.  Only me and Maggie came out.
112,DEAN,"This tunnel, is it the only way north?"
112,MAGGIE,"There’s a mountain pass, but it’s a long way around.  Tunnel’s the quickest route."
112,GABRIEL,If the long way is the safe way…
112,SAM,No.  We’re already two days out from Dayton as it is.  We don’t have time for a detour.
112,ROWENA,"Shut your mouth!  --Oh!  You want to get inside my head, twist the knife?  Two can play that game.  Do you know what your grace is making possible right now?  The heartfelt family reunion of Sam, Dean, Cas, Mary, and your very own son Jack. That's right. Your wee boy's over there, and he'll be so glad to see his three fathers. Of course, as far as he's concerned, they are his father. And you? You're nothing to him. Or me. Or anyone now. Nothing."
112,LUCIFER,"Ah, Red.  You shouldn’t have made me mad.  Step into my office."
112,LUCIFER,"You know...you and Gabe, you kicked me when I was down.  I didn’t have any fight.  I didn’t have anything to live for.  But you, you, you gave me something to fight for again.  My boy.  So for that, I’m going to be quick."
112,ROWENA,"Fine. This isn’t how you wanted things to work out, but yes, Rowena, thanks to you, Sam and Dean’ll be trapped in some sort of nightmare universe with the Devil himself. And you’re the only person who might be able to devise a way to keep the door back home open for them. But...Sorry, boys. Au revoir, bon voyage, not my problem."
112,ROWENA,Bums bollocks.
112,MAGGIE,You good?
112,FLOYD,"What do you think?  Second time’s a charm, right?"
112,SAM,"All right.  Here’s the plan.  Stay close, keep walking.  Anything moves, kill it."
112,DEAN,Let’s do this!
112,FLOYD,Arggh!
112,FLOYD,Sorry. Tripped.
112,SAM,"Wait, wait, wait.  Let me."
112,FLOYD,Maggie!  Maggie!
112,DEAN,Let’s keep moving.
112,DEAN,Hey.  We got a blocked passage over here.  Need to move some rocks.
112,MAGGIE,Guys!
112,MAGGIE,Floyd!
112,SAM,I’ve got it.  I’ve got it.
112,DEAN,Sammy!
112,CAS,Sam!
112,DEAN,Sammy!
112,CAS,He’s gone.
112,DEAN,No!
112,CAS,We can’t save him.
112,MAGGIE,"Dean?  Um, about your friend...I’m so sorr --"
112,MAGGIE,We must be getting close to Dayton.  On the outskirts at least.
112,CAS,I-I-I can’t.  This...warding is too strong.
112,CAS,Whoa.
112,CAS,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.  We’re--we’re not here to fight."
112,CAS,We’re just looking for…
112,MARY,Castiel?
112,MARY,Dean...where’s Sam?
112,LUCIFER,Boo!
112,LUCIFER,"Hey, Sammy."
112,LUCIFER,I did.  You’re welcome.
112,LUCIFER,"Oh, well, I’m getting to that."
112,LUCIFER,"Oh, she’s okay.  I mean I -- I was going to kill her, but she blasted me here before I had a chance to, so... It’s great, self-defence. But, uh, I was coming here anyway."
112,LUCIFER,"So how did I have the juice to pull off my little Lazarus trick? Uh, that's a long story, but I was basically tracking you here, and then I came across a handful of Michael's angels and I... ate 'em. I guess it's not really a long story, is it?"
112,SAM,What do you want?
112,LUCIFER,Are you going?
112,LUCIFER,Here. It’s dark out there.
112,LUCIFER,"Yeah, they’re sorta...sorta all over there, and I’m holding them back."
112,LUCIFER,"They’re just waiting for a little snap of my fingers, but I didn’t want ‘em flooding in her and eatin’ ya again, not until we finished our convo."
112,LUCIFER,"I want what you already have -- a relationship with my son. Okay, there was a time that I would, you know, just grab him, but... I've grown."
112,LUCIFER,"I have, Samuel. I want my son, and you're gonna help me."
112,LUCIFER,"Well, I don’t feel like he’ll give me a chance unless I come bearing gifts."
112,LUCIFER,Yup.  Boop! (tapping Sam on the chest)
112,LUCIFER,That’s you.
112,LUCIFER,"Look, Sammy, I'm -- I'm not asking you to -- to like it or to like me. All I'm asking is that you acknowledge the truth, that I was the one who brought you back to life, that I was the one who lifted you from the darkness and into the light. Okay?"
112,LUCIFER,"Apocalypse World, Michael's armies -- you really think you and your family can handle that stuff alone? You need me."
112,SAM,And what if I say no?
112,LUCIFER,"All right, let me just make this really, really, really easy -- easy enough for even you to understand, Sammy. I’m gettin’ to Jack, one way or the other.  The only question is are you coming with?"
112,LUCIFER,Or that?
112,LUCIFER,"Your move, champ."
112,CAS,"Jack, I --"
112,Gabriel,I’m not strong enough.
112,DEAN,"We have to go back, get his body."

149,Alley.,A police car is parked in the alley in which Connor was killed. A police woman is getting out of the car. Castiel and Jack are walking towards her.
149,Crossroad.,Castiel is digging a hole at a crossroad while Jack is sitting on the backend of the truck with a tablet.
149,Later.,"The Pastor is pushing a cloth on the girl's wound. The girl is breathing heavily, crying."
149,CASTIEL,"This lie, it won't hurt them. It won't... It won't cause them pain or sadness. Sam and Dean taught me that some lies are necessary."
152,SAM,Remember when Sergei was here? Remember what he was looking for?
152,CASTIEL,I'm the one you want. I'm the one who woke you up.
152,SAM,(to Jack) Sacrificing your life for a cause takes a lot of courage.
152,CHUCK,"Think of it, starting fresh. Creating something new, together."
152,DEAN,It's time.
153,MICHAEL,Sons and fathers are... complicated. Ask Dean.
