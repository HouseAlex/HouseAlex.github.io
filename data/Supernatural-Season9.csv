305,DEAN,One of yours?
310,DEAN,"Reverend Buddy Boyle's ""Goin' For Glory Hour."""
310,SAM,"Angels can't possess a human without permission, right?"
310,DEAN,Yep.
310,SAM,"So, what, they're using this guy to find vessels?"
310,DEAN,It's a willing audience.
310,ABADDON,Who put Crowley in charge?
310,ABADDON,He's a salesman!
310,ABADDON,Right now you and I are gonna talk about a regime change.
310,CROWLEY,Where do I start to even look for forgiveness?
310,SAM,How 'bout we start with this?  (SAM jabs CROWLEY in the neck with a syringe of Sam's purified blood.)
310,ANGEL,You're human?
310,DEAN,Zeke?
310,ZEKE-in-SAM,Castiel cannot stay here.  He will bring the angels down on all of us.
310,DEAN,He's warded.
310,ZEKE-in-SAM,"He was warded when April found him.  Castiel is in danger.  And if he is here,  I am in danger."
310,DEAN,"Wait, you're in danger?"
310,ZEKE-in-SAM,"If he stays, I am afraid I will have no choice but to leave."
310,JOE,Who are you?  Did the lady from the hotline send you?
310,INTRUDER,"No.  (He's wearing a small cross earring in his left ear.)  
You did."
310,CASTIEL,"Bill.  High—  (CASTIEL holds up his hand for a high-five as the delivery man walks past, ignoring it. ) —five.  (CASTIEL closes his hand and lowers it.)"
310,NORA,—then hit every red light on the way here.  (She looks around.)  But guess I shouldn't have worried.
310,NORA,Place looks great.  Coffee urns?
310,CASTIEL,"Uh, full."
310,NORA,Dairy case?
310,CASTIEL,Stocked.
310,NORA,"Okay, Steve, last question – (CASTIEL looks up attentively) – where have you been all my life?  (CASTIEL's mouth works, speechlessly.)"
310,NORA,You're not like the other sales associates.
310,NORA,There's... something different about you.
310,CASTIEL,"I can assure you, there's – there's not."
310,NORA,I know these things.  You're ... hmm … special.
310,KEVIN,"It's cuneiform.  (SAM and DEAN both look at him.)  I-I hit a wall translating the tablet into English. But I found an ancient codex, uh,  linking the Angel script to proto-Elamite cuneiform, and I was able to translate the tablet and the footnotes into Elamite, which … is …"
310,DEAN,Doodles.
310,KEVIN,It's extinct.
310,SAM,"Well, can you read it?"
310,KEVIN,No one can.  Scholars have tried for centuries.
310,DEAN,So it's a dead end?  (DEAN slaps the papers down on the table in disgust.  SAM puts his sheaf of papers on the table too.)
310,KEVIN,"N-not quite. Now, most proto-Elamite is abstract, but I was able to decipher one phrase from Metatron's footnotes. ""Falling angels."""
310,SAM,"Okay, so, the footnotes refer to Metatron's spell?"
310,KEVIN,Maybe.
310,SAM,"Okay.  (Walking to bookshelf.)  Well, maybe if we can decipher the footnotes, then we can reverse the spell and..."
310,DEAN,"Punt those winged dicks back to heaven. (DEAN slaps the table, ready for action.)  Where do we start?"
310,SAM,"Research.   (SAM tosses one book in front of each of the other two.  DEAN's expression is less than thrilled.)   We comb through the library, see if we can find anything else on Elamite."
310,KEVIN,24.
310,DEAN,"Awesome. (He looks pleadingly over at SAM, who chuffs and looks down at his book.)"
310,DEAN,Hello?
310,CASTIEL,"Presumed dead, but no bodies have been released to loved ones.  And, there were reports of a strange substance at the scenes."
310,DEAN,"Oh, well, hello to you too, Cas.  How are you?"
310,CASTIEL,I ... am busy.
310,DEAN,"All right. So, how do you want to do this?"
310,DEAN,You want to meet up at the latest scene?  You want me to pick you up?  What?
310,CASTIEL,Um …  I've got my hands full over here.  I just – um...
310,DEAN,Cas? Hello?
310,DEAN,"Hey, you sure everything's – (He hears the click and looks at the phone.)  O-kay …"
310,SAM,"So, he said nothing about where he is or – or what he's been doing?"
310,DEAN,This is Cas.
310,DEAN,"In case you forgot, he's not exactly Chatty Cathy."
310,DEAN,"Well, like I said, as long as he's catnip for angels, he's keeping his distance."
310,SAM,"So then, what's the point, Dean?"
310,KEVIN,"In other words, a perfect excuse to bail out on research."
310,DEAN,(brief pause)  You got me.
310,NORA,"Hey, Steve?  I found this in the supply closet.  (She holds up a plastic bag with … toothpaste ? in it)  Do you know whose it is?"
310,CASTIEL,Um... (comes down from the ladder)  That's mine. Thanks.
310,NORA,I also found a rolled-up sleeping bag behind the tool locker.
310,CASTIEL,"Yes, (thinking fast) I wanted to be thorough with inventory, so I worked late last week, and taking a nap here was easier than going back home to my bed.  Which I-I have, of course – a bed...and a home."
310,NORA,"Wow, Steve.  You're so... responsible."
310,NORA,"I've been afraid to ask.  I-I don't want to take advantage  of you as my employee, and I certainly don't want to jeopardize our working relationship. But as a working single mom, it's hard enough to get a date, let alone meet a really great guy.  (CASTIEL looks a little puzzled about where all this is going.) And …  tomorrow's my night off, and I know you're off, too, and … I was just wondering if there's any chance you're... free tomorrow night?"
310,CASTIEL,Um... (pause) Yes?  (looks down; happy guitar music starts)   Yes.
310,NORA,You're the best!  (She bounces off happily.)
310,DEAN,"So, uh, four missing?"
310,SHERIFF,Four dead.  Just got confirmation.
310,DEAN,"And, uh, any common threads you can think of?"
310,SHERIFF,"Well, Joe in there had the suicide hotline on speed dial. The gal before him was a shut-in. Had enough antidepressants in her medicine cabinet to stock a pharmacy. The first victims – a married couple out of Sugar City. Pretty much a walking billboard for no-fault divorce."
310,DEAN,Were they all basket cases?
310,SHERIFF,"If you asked me to make a list of this county's saddest sacks, these four would've been right on top."
310,DEAN,"All right, so, four unhappy people, one of them definitely suicidal. But you've ruled out suicide?"
310,SHERIFF,You're gonna want to put these on.
310,SHERIFF,This look like suicide to you?
310,DEAN,Blood?
310,SHERIFF,"If the tests come back same as the others … it's everything. Blood, skin, hair, nails. Internal organs. Even clothing fibers.  Like these poor souls got run through the world's finest wood-chipper."
310,DEAN,What about witnesses?
310,SHERIFF,"Same as the rest. Neighbors reported some kind of a pink flash. By the time we got here, all that was left was ... this."
310,SAM,"Yeah, we're almost through the texts over here. (pause) We got nothing."
310,SAM,"Yeah, he's unreachable. He took a sabbatical to live amongst the Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea. Needless to say, we're pretty burnt."
310,DEAN,"Well, there's one guy there who is nothing if not well-rested."
310,SAM,Crowley?
310,DEAN,I'm just saying we're not keeping him chained up for the one-liners.
310,SAM,"It's worth a shot, I guess."
310,DEAN,"Just be careful, all right? Don't fall for any of his ""quid pro quo"" crap."
310,SAM,"Noted.  So, what about you?  How's Cas' lead panning out?"
310,DEAN,"No, no, no. I already ruled them out.  The bodies were vaporized. They weren't burned."
310,SAM,"That sounds like a real case.  Dean, I should be there."
310,DEAN,"Naw, man. That's – That's uh ... not necessary.  No, I, uh – I got this one covered."
310,GIRL,"He dumped me, Jace.  (pause)  In the cafeteria. In front of everyone. It's just like ... who does that, you know? Like, why couldn't he just dump me on Facebook like a normal person? (pause) I've been destroyed. Socially and romantically … totaled. (pause) I know. I'm just so embarrassed, Jace. I could just die."
310,GIRL,What?
310,DEAN,I'll have some beef jerky and a pack of menthols.
310,CASTIEL,What are you doing here?
310,DEAN,"Gee, it's nice to see you, too, Cas."
310,CASTIEL,"It's … Steve now.  (gesturing towards his employee name tag)  And... uh, you know you surprised me."
310,DEAN,"Well, the feeling is mutual. I mean, I knew you had to lay low from the angel threat, but, uh, wow.  This is some cover."
310,CASTIEL,"My Grace is gone. What did you expect? Do you have any idea how hard it was? When I fell to earth, I didn't just lose my powers. I – I had nothing. Now... I'm a sales associate (proudly)"
310,DEAN,A sales associate?
310,CASTIEL,"I'm responsible for inventory, sales, customer service. I keep this place – (he hands the clip board to the delivery guy, who says ""Thank you"" and leaves) – Thank YOU (to the delivery guy) – clean and presentable. And when my manager's busy, I even prepare the food."
310,DEAN,Wow. So you went from fighting … heavenly battles to nuking taquitos?
310,SAM,Can you read Elamite or not?
310,CROWLEY,"It's by no means my favorite of the ancient tongues, but yes."
310,SAM,Will you help us read it?
310,CROWLEY,Why on earth would I?
310,SAM,"Because I was there that night. I saw what humanity did to you.  (Crowley scoffs very quietly.)  Like it or not, there's still a little part of you that's not a douche."
310,CROWLEY,"Sorry, Moose.  To the last drop."
310,CROWLEY,Which is?
310,SAM,"I'm not so sure. Our last encounter with Abaddon, she was, uh – she was pretty terrifying. Scarier than you've been in years.  (SAM laughs.)"
310,CROWLEY,Bring that to me.
310,DEAN,"This is not you, man.  You are above this. Come on. (CASTIEL has a stubborn expression on his face.)"
310,CASTIEL,"No, Dean.  (He puts the box on the counter and turns to face DEAN.)   I'm not. I failed at being an angel. Everything I ever attempted came out wrong. But here …  at least I have a shot at getting things right.  I guess you can't see it, but …  there's a real dignity in what I do – human dignity."
310,NORA,"Hate to interrupt you guys, but, Steve?  Customer had an accident in the men's room."
310,CASTIEL,I'm on it.
310,NORA,"Oh, and tonight – 7:00 at my place work for you?"
310,CASTIEL,Great.
310,NORA,You're the best!
310,DEAN,That's what this is about!
310,CASTIEL,What?
310,DEAN,The girl.
310,DEAN,"Yeah. I mean, my dates usually end when I run out of singles, but, uh, yeah. Yeah, that's something that … humans do."
310,CASTIEL,I wouldn't be much use. I don't have my powers.
310,DEAN,So?  I've never had powers.
310,CASTIEL,You are a hunter.
310,DEAN,"And you're a hunter in training, remember?"
310,CASTIEL,"Yeah, I remember. You said I sucked."
310,DEAN,"I didn't say that. I said that there was, uh, uh, you know, ""room for improvement."" Come on."
310,CASTIEL,"All right, my shift's over in five minutes, and my date's not until later, so..."
310,DEAN,Attaboy! I'll go get the car.
310,CASTIEL,Not just yet.  I have to clean the bathroom? (He pointedly reminds DEAN.)
310,JACE,"One second, we're talking, and the next, she just...stops. And then everyone in the cafeteria freaks, rushing, and pointing out the window, at— (she breaks into sobs)  C- could that really be her?"
310,DEAN,"And nobody saw anybody else at the scene – a man, a woman ... anything unusual?"
310,DEAN,"Your friend, was she, uh, depressed?"
310,JACE,Depressed?
310,DEAN,Any thoughts of suicide?
310,JACE,"Ew. No.  I mean, she was kind of bummed that dick-bag Travis broke up with her in front of the whole school."
310,DEAN,'Kind of bummed'?
310,DEAN,Excuse me.
310,DEAN,"Cas, what's wrong?"
310,CASTIEL,I've seen this before.
310,DEAN,What? Where?
310,CASTIEL,In heaven.
310,DEAN,"What, you're saying an angel did this?"
310,CASTIEL,"It's no ordinary angel. Dean, this is bad. This is very bad."
310,CASTIEL,"On the battlefields of Heaven, there was a special class of angel, the Rit Zien. It's, uh, Enochian for ""Hands of Mercy."" They functioned like medics. They tended to the wounded. They healed those who could be healed, but for the mortally wounded, those who were past saving, the Rit Zien's job was to put them down."
310,DEAN,But the granulated bodies?
310,CASTIEL,This was their special ability. They had this way of smiting that was so quick and so total that it rendered death virtually painless.
310,DEAN,"Yeah, but these aren't wounded angels that they're vaporizing, they're people."
310,CASTIEL,"Right. I don't know. The Rit Zien home in on pain, it's like a beacon to them. So, when this angel fell to earth, he heard the victims' cries, and their anguish, same as he'd hear an angel's in heaven. He's continuing his heavenly work down here. One suffering human at a time."
310,DEAN,"Yeah, but this last victim was not suffering. She was just a normal, moody kid."
310,CASTIEL,"But he just got here.  The ebb and flow of human emotion – Dean, I've been on earth for a few years, and I've only begun to grasp it. To him, pain is pain."
310,DEAN,So everybody's fair game?
310,DEAN,"All right, well, we got to stop him."
310,CASTIEL,You have to stop him.
310,DEAN,You're scared.
310,CASTIEL,"It's different now, Dean. Everything feels different."
310,DEAN,"You're right. All right, I'll track down this, uh, Kevorkian wannabe, and I'll put him down."
310,DEAN,"You stay safe. Go on that date, all right?  Go live a normal life."
310,CASTIEL,Okay.
310,DEAN,Well?
310,CASTIEL,I need a ride.
310,DEAN,Right.
310,CROWLEY,I'll do it. But I want something in return.
310,SAM,"Yeah, what's that?"
310,CROWLEY,A telephone call.
310,CROWLEY,"Come on, Moose!  Even Dahmer got one telephone call."
310,KEVIN,Seriously?  You want to let Crowley communicate with Abaddon?  A king and a power-mad knight of hell isn't enough for you?  You want to throw a demonic team-up into the mix?
310,SAM,"I don't think so.  I mean, I – I don't trust Crowley, either. But I can't honestly see him working with Abaddon. He hates her too much."
310,KEVIN,You said it. You can't trust him.
310,SAM,"We don't have to. Look, Crowley's bound. Ah, We can end the call whenever we want. Even if he wanted to give Abaddon information, he has none to give her. He doesn't even know where the bunker is."
310,KEVIN,He says he can decrypt the translation? What if he's lying?
310,SAM,You're right. We're gonna need proof.
310,SAM,What are these?
310,SAM,More specific.
310,KEVIN,And the rest of them.
310,CROWLEY,Phone call. You'll get the rest when I get paid.  Now.  Who's gonna be a dear and open up a vein?
310,DEAN,Okay.
310,CASTIEL,"Thanks, Dean."
310,DEAN,Cas.  Wait.  (DEAN sighs.)   I can't let you do this.
310,CAS,What?
310,DEAN,"Okay.  Uh, lose the vest."
310,CASTIEL,What are you –
310,DEAN,"Lose the vest, come on."
310,DEAN,That's a little better.  All right.  There we go. All right.
310,DEAN,And do the buttons –  why don't you unbutton it?
310,DEAN,"Okay. Th- that's far enough, Tony Manero.  (DEAN laughs a little.)  Um... (DEAN gives CASTIEL a once-over.)  Yeah. Good. All right.  Listen to me. Always open the door for her, okay? Ask a lot of questions. They like that. And, uh... Oh, if she says she's happy to go Dutch …  she's lying. All right?"
310,DEAN,"Go get 'em, tiger."
310,NORA,Steve!  I'm so glad you're here.  (She smiles welcomingly.)   Come in. I thought I was gonna be late!
310,CASTIEL,Late for what?
310,CASTIEL,Babysitting.
310,CROWLEY,Not yours. His. (CROWLEY nods his head towards KEVIN.)
310,SAM,What difference does it make?
310,CROWLEY,"I've had yours.  Stuck in here, you can't fault me for wanting a little variety."
310,KEVIN,No way!
310,CROWLEY,"What's wrong, Short Round? Afraid of needles?"
310,KEVIN,"No, I just have a policy of not giving blood to anyone who's murdered my mother."
310,CROWLEY,I … have nothing … but time.
310,SAM,You're a dick.  (Packs up the kit.)
310,CROWLEY,Good luck with that translation.
310,SAM,What? What happened?
310,CROWLEY,I've been placed on hold.
310,CASTIEL,"Hello?  Um...  Please – please don't.  Um …   Okay.  Oooo-kay, okay.  (Picks up the baby.)   How 'bout – how 'bout a lullaby?   Um...  Okay. Shh. Shh!"
310,CASTIEL,"Shhh.  I know, I know."
310,DEAN,Sheriff?
310,SHERIFF,"Now, here's a wrinkle. Our first crime scene, married couple? Full analysis of the spray came in from the lab. Turns out it only contains the wife's DNA."
310,DEAN,The husband's still out there.
310,CASTIEL,"Oh, shh. Shh. Shh. Shh."
310,SHERIFF,"He was already a bit screwy, but then he found religion. She was a hard-line atheist, no peach herself, when he got himself obsessed with this Buddy Boyle whack job, an already bad marriage got worse. Kept telling her to ""Let God in."""
310,DEAN,Buddy Boyle. That explains it.
310,SHERIFF,Explains what?
310,DEAN,Never mind.  Let's see.  (looking at photos)   Is that his truck?  (remembering the truck that almost boxed him in at NORA's house)
310,SHERIFF,Yep.
310,DEAN,Cas ... (realizing the angel is heading for CAS)
310,ANGEL,"Hello, Castiel."
310,ANGEL,Squalid little dump.  No wonder she cries.
310,CASTIEL,"It's a fever, Ephraim.  It will pass."
310,CASTIEL,"You know, there's a lot you don't understand about humanity at first. If you would just stop—"
310,EPHRAIM,Stop? I won't stop …  until I wash the planet clean of all suffering.
310,EPHRAIM,Allow me.
310,EPHRAIM,"You think I came for her?  No, Castiel.  I came for you."
310,SAM,How long's it take to transfer a demonic phone call?
310,CROWLEY,"Can it, Moose."
310,KEVIN,"Crowley, you got your call."
310,SAM,"Yeah, it's time."
310,CROWLEY,It's time when I bloody well say it's time!
310,ABADDON,"Crowley, how in the hell are you?"
310,EPHRAIM,"So much pain and despair, so many voices begging out for relief."
310,CASTIEL,How'd you find me?
310,EPHRAIM,Because you're warded? The same way I find all my patients – I just followed the sound of your pain. You have no idea how loud it is. I could hear you for miles.
310,CASTIEL,Do you really think you're doing Heaven's work down here?
310,EPHRAIM,I know I am.
310,CASTIEL,"Well, you're wrong. Earth can be a hard place. But these humans, they can get better. They're just doing the best they can."
310,EPHRAIM,"Is that what you think you're doing, Castiel – the best you can? Well, I'm sorry. But if this is the best that the famed Castiel can do, you're a more urgent case than I thought. I used to admire you. You failed more often than you succeeded. But at least you played big."
310,EPHRAIM,Now what are you doing? Burying your head in the sand. Right when your kind needs you the most.
310,CROWLEY,And how are the numbers?
310,ABADDON,"You mean souls? I've managed to double on your projections. Now, how did I ever pull off such a feat?"
310,CROWLEY,You're taking souls before their time.  Voiding my contracts!
310,ABADDON,"That's right. I'm taking it all down, brick by brick. It's over. The days of Crowley, the king of bureaucrats – are done."
310,EPHRAIM,Shh-shh-shhh. It'll be over soon. I'll take the pain away.
310,CASTIEL,I want to live.
310,EPHRAIM,"But as what, Castiel? As an angel?  or a man?"
310,CROWLEY,You... ganky... putrescent... skanger.
310,ABADDON,"No one's seen you in weeks, and last I saw you, Howdy and Doody had you tied up nice and tight. Seems to reason, they've turned you into a kennel dog. How does it feel, Crowley, to be the Winchesters' bitch? It's been fun indulging in your bluffs, but we both know you have no real authority left, no leverage.   You have nothing to offer me.  You have – nothing."
310,CROWLEY,Your way will backfire.  You.  Will.  Burn.
310,ABADDON,I can't wait.
310,SAM,Crowley?
310,CROWLEY,Bring me the translations.  I keep my agreements.
310,SAM,What?
310,CROWLEY,This spell can't be undone. The new world order – we're stuck with it.
310,EPHRAIM,"You say you want to live.  But you can't see what I see. By choosing a human life, you've already given up.  You … chose … death."
310,DEAN,"Well, there's no way. Crowley's lying."
310,SAM,"No, Dean, not this time. Look, Metatron built the spell to withstand any attempt to reverse it. There is no putting the angels back in Heaven.  It's done."
310,SAM,Are you gonna tell Cas?
310,NORA,"Oh, that's okay.  Date was a bust anyway.  (pause; CASTIEL walks down the stairs)   Steve?  (CASTIEL stops and turns to look at her.)  The part of you that overreacted, that cares so much? That's what makes you special."
310,DEAN,"Listen, Cas … Back at the bunker, I, uh... Sorry I told you to go.  I know it's been hard on you, you know, on your own.  Well, you're adapting.  I'm proud of you."
310,CASTIEL,"Thank you, Dean.  (Sighs) But there's something Ephraim said. The angels – they need help. Can I really sit this out? Shouldn't I be searching for a way to get them home?"
310,DEAN,Me and Sam will take care of the angels.  You're human now. It's not your problem anymore.
311,SAM,What else do you remember?
311,DEAN,"Nothing. I was a kid, all right?"
311,JOHN,And most important—
311,EZEKIEL,I heal Sam while healing myself.
311,DEAN,"You went through the trials.  I just think it's better if you took it easy, you know, and didn't act like you were—"
311,MAN,"All right!   Game is over, boys!  Let's bring it in!  (looking for kids)  Lights out was 10 minutes ago!"
311,MAN,Boys?  (pause)  Come on!  This isn't funny.
311,SAM,Dean?
311,SAM,Hello?
311,SAM,"I'm sorry, there's no, uh ˜ there's no Dee-dawg, uh..."
311,DEAN,"I got it, I got it.  (DEAN takes the phone.)   Sonny, hey.  (pause)  So what's up?   (pause)  Okay.  (pause)  All right. Yeah, just sit tight.  I'll be there as soon as I can.  (pause)  Yeah."
311,SAM,"So, what was that all about, 'Dee-dawg'?"
311,DEAN,"Truth is, uh…"
311,SAM,"A boys' home, like a … reform school?"
311,DEAN,"Yeah, more or less.  It was a farm, and the guy who ran it – Sonny – he, uh, you know, he looked after me."
311,SAM,Wait. Does Sonny know what we do?
311,DEAN,"Yeah. He's good people.  I gave him the number to the Bat Phone, and sounds like he's got something in our wheelhouse."
311,SAM,"Uh, no. Yeah, I'm just, uh ... I'll be fine."
311,DEAN,"Yeah.  Right.  All right.  Grab your stuff,  and we'll head out."
311,SAM,"Hey, Dean ... I mean, why didn't you just tell me you went to a boys' home?"
311,DEAN,"I don't know. Uh, it was Dad's idea.  And then it just – you know, the story became the story.  I was 16."
311,SAM,You were here for two months and Dad couldn't find you?
311,DEAN,"Oh, no.  He found me.  He found me quick.  But he left me here 'cause I lost our money."
311,SAM,You were 16.  You made a mistake.
311,DEAN,Hi.
311,RUTH,What can I do for you boys?
311,DEAN,"I'm Dean. This is my brother, Sam.  We're old buddies of Sonny's."
311,RUTH,Prison buddies?
311,DEAN,No.  Uh ... you mind telling him that we're here?
311,DEAN,"What, and we're such angels?  Trust me, he's more than made up for it."
311,SONNY,So what'd he take?
311,SONNY,Okay.  And how about family?
311,SONNY,"I don't see why not, man."
311,SONNY,"You shouldn't do that, kid."
311,SONNY,"Because when you make him mad, he leaves with the key."
311,SONNY,"Eh, don't sweat it."
311,SONNY,Okay.
311,DEAN,"So, how do you know I won't just run away?"
311,SONNY,Because you're hungry.
311,SONNY,"Well, then, why'd you steal bread and peanut butter?"
311,SONNY,It's for boys like you.  You work the land.  Teaches you some discipline and responsibility.  Keep you out of trouble.
311,SONNY,Beats jail.  Come on.  I'll fix you something to eat.
311,SONNY,Dee-dawg!
311,DEAN,Sonny! Good to see you.
311,SONNY,"Hey, you, too, brother.  (They hug. SAM stands by watching.)  Oh, and this must be Sam."
311,SAM,Good to meet you.
311,SONNY,"Back at you, brother."
311,DEAN,"So, farm looks, uh, nice."
311,SONNY,"Oh, please, man.  It's barely standing.  Only got a handful of kids working around here now."
311,DEAN,Why's that?
311,SONNY,"Because these days, the system would rather incarcerate a boy than redeem him."
311,SAM,"Hey, Sonny, uh, you – you mind if we talk alone?"
311,DEAN,"All right. So, what's happening?"
311,SONNY,"Well, you remember Jack, don't you?"
311,DEAN,"Yeah. The, uh, tough, old leatherneck."
311,SONNY,"Mm-hmm.  Well, somehow, that ancient, rusty, broken-down tractor just roared to life and ran him over the other night."
311,SAM,"Maybe – maybe it just, uh, slipped out of park or something."
311,SONNY,"Couldn't have.  (Shakes his head.)   You know, I never – I never believed any of this mumbo-jumbo stuff you boys are into, but... something ain't right."
311,SAM,What do you mean?
311,SONNY,"Well, just … things started happening – you know, lights flickering on and off, strange scratching sounds coming from inside the walls, windows and doors slamming."
311,DEAN,All right.  You think you can round up the boys while we take a look around?
311,SONNY,"Well, that shouldn't be a problem.  Most are home on break – well, except those with no home worth going to."
311,DEAN,Mm.
311,SAM,Yeah.
311,SAM,"Hey. I am so sorry.  I-I-I thought I ... saw something in, uh –"
311,RUTH,"Like a ghost?  (She sounds more human and pleasant for the first time, and looks at the window.)"
311,RUTH,"Sonny told me you were old friends, but … I know why you're really here.  That's why I was praying for us."
311,SAM,Praying for what?
311,DEAN,"All right, Casper... Where're you at?"
311,DEAN,"Hey, kid, what are you doing in here by yourself?"
311,Kid,Fighting monsters.
311,DEAN,What kind of monsters?
311,KID,"All sorts, with Bruce the monster smasher.  (The KID holds up his action figure doll.)"
311,DEAN,"Hm.  Is that a cape?  Little impractical for smashing monsters, huh?   You know, you could choke—"
311,KID,Timmy.  (shakes hand)
311,DEAN,"Let's try that again.  If you're gonna be a man, you got to learn how to shake like one, okay?  So give me your best Kung Fu grip.  Good.  (They shake again.)  Now look me straight in the eye.  Let me know  that you mean business.  Shake as hard as you can.  (Shake again.)  That's it.  You shake like that, you'll be all right.   (TIMMY smiles.)  Hey, Timmy, did you know Jack who worked here?"
311,DEAN,What can you tell me about him?
311,TIMMY,He yelled a lot.  He was yelling when he had his accident.
311,DEAN,How do you know that?
311,TIMMY,'Cause me and the other boys were playing here when it happened.
311,DEAN,"Did you see anything?  (TIMMY shakes his head no.)   Is there anything else about that night that you can remember, anything at all?"
311,TIMMY,It suddenly … got really cold.  (DEAN looks thoughtful.)  Can I go?  I have to finish my chores before Miss Ruth gets mad.
311,DEAN,"That Ruth –  she runs a tight ship, huh?  Yeah, you better roll."
311,SAM,He killed her?
311,RUTH,"With a meat cleaver.   Got life in jail.  Which for Howard ended a year ago.  He always swore he'd get his revenge on poor old Jack, and ... looks like he finally got it."
311,SAM,Is Howard buried here in town?
311,SAM,So …  Dad didn't want you to tell me.  How come?  Was this place really so bad?
311,DEAN,"I don't really remember.  I mean, look, nobody bad touched me.  Nobody burned me with their smokes, or beat me with a metal hanger.  I call that a win."
311,DEAN:,Hey.
311,RUTH,Help! Help!
311,SONNY,"Ruth, you okay?  What's wrong?"
311,SONNY,Open up!
311,SONNY,Ruth!
311,SAM,"Dean, you know I'm fine just grabbing a burger-to-go somewhere, right?"
311,DEAN,"What, and miss out on the best banana pancakes you ever had?"
311,SONNY,No prob.  I do this for all the boys after they've been here for a month.
311,SONNY,"Well, being hungry's not a crime.  It's the stealing that is.  But I feel if you only do that once, you don't deserve a record.  And seeing as how we can't find your pops anywhere, you can stay here as long as you want, Dean.  You're doing good in school.  You're making friends.  You made the wrestling team.  I'm proud of you.  (pause)  Let me ask you something, and I want you to be straight with me.  Are you into the whole heavy-metal, devil-worshiping stuff?"
311,SONNY,"Hey, I'm not –  I'm not judging.  It's just I found a few occult-looking symbols carved into your bedpost."
311,SONNY,That story have anything to do with why you put the salt in front of your bunk door every night before bed?
311,SONNY,Same family that left you here?
311,SONNY,"I was part of this gang, right?  They were my family.  I lived, breathed, I would have even died for them.  You know where it got me?  15 years in a correctional facility.  And for what? Being loyal?  To who?  I should have been loyal to myself. Because you get one shot at this game, Dean, and when you look in the mirror, you want the guy looking back at you to be his own man."
311,SONNY,"Hey, Robin.  How are you?"
311,SONNY,"Good.  Meet my new ranch foreman here, Dean."
311,ROBIN,Hi. Welcome to Cus's.  What can I get you two?
311,DEAN,"Bet you never thought you'd see me here, huh?  (He smiles insinuatingly.)"
311,ROBIN,"Uh,  look, I'm a little bit slammed right now.  Do you guys want to hear the specials?"
311,ROBIN,Um ...
311,DEAN,I used to live up at Sonny's.
311,ROBIN,"Oh, oh.  Uh, look, sorry.  There's just – there's so many boys that pass through there, it's – it's hard to remember every – every name and face."
311,DEAN,"Yeah. Uh, no.  Sorry, I just – I remember you coming up there  with your mom.  She'd give guitar lessons.  It's, uh – it was a long time ago."
311,ROBIN,Yeah. Mom – she loved helping out the boys.  I guess that's why I kept giving lessons after she passed.
311,ROBIN,"Um, would you excuse me?  I'll be right back."
311,SAM,Dude …?
311,SAM,Wh – what was that?
311,DEAN,Nothing.
311,SAM,"Nothing? Well, obviously it was something.  Who was that waitress?"
311,DEAN,"I said it was nothing, all right?  Drop it."
311,DEAN,Sonny.  (pause)  What?!
311,SONNY,"I tried to get in to save her, but the damn door wouldn't open."
311,SAM,Locked?
311,SONNY,There's no locks on the farm.
311,SONNY,"What, 'cause we're not chest-deep in weird already, boys?"
311,DEAN,"I know, I know.  I mean anything – really."
311,SONNY,"There was one thing.  Ruth always had her rosary beads with her, but now I can't find them anywhere."
311,SAM,"All right. Um, let's start with the vics, okay?  I mean, both lived in the house.   They both, uh, worked closely with the boys."
311,DEAN,"All right, why don't I go have a chat with the rug rats, see what's up?  (Dean walks off)"
311,SAM,"Yeah.  Sonny, you got any employee records on the victims?"
311,SONNY,In my office.  Let's do it.
311,DEAN,"Timmy, what's going on?"
311,DEAN,"All right, you two.  Where were you this morning when Ruth had her accident?"
311,DEAN,"Oh, okay.  Well ..."
311,DEAN,What about Ruth?  What can you tell me about her?
311,DEAN,Obviously. What else?  Anything different or weird you can think of?
311,DEAN,"Hey!  (lower voice:)  Either of you touch him ever again, I'm gonna go all Guantánamo on you.  (KID 2 swallows.)  Understand me?  You get the hell out of here.  Go on! Get."
311,DEAN,Hey.  You and Bruce okay?
311,TIMMY,Yeah.
311,DEAN,"Listen to me.  Guys like that – they're cowards, okay?  All you got to do is stand up to them one time and they'll stop, I promise."
311,SAM,"Hey Sonny, wait.  Um ...  W-what is all this?"
311,SONNY,"It's our hall of fame.  We had some pretty great athletes come through here, including your brother.  (SAM exhales.)  He was Sullivan county 135-pound wrestling champion.  (SAM exhales again.)"
311,ROBIN,"Hey, guys!"
311,DEAN,"Kid's gonna need about 8,000 stitches, but he'll be fine."
311,SAM,"That kid was bullying Timmy before the accident, right?"
311,DEAN,Yeah. Why?
311,SAM,Check this out.  (handing DEAN the file)  Timmy was found in an abandoned building about a year ago all by himself.  No one was sure how long he had been there.
311,DEAN,And what about his parents?  (tosses file back to SAM)
311,SAM,"Well, they posted a picture on the Internet, but no one ever showed up."
311,DEAN,"Well, then, what's he doing here?  Shouldn't he be in an orphanage?"
311,SAM,"He kept running away from Child Services.  So about three months ago, Sonny offered to take him in."
311,DEAN,"All right, so hard-ass counselors, bullies, all bite the dust, but Timmy's still standing.  So, what are we talking?  We got ourselves a Damien on our hands?"
311,SAM,No.  EMF rules out a demon.  So ...  probably ghost possession.
311,DEAN,"Meaning what, we find Timmy and shove a fistful of salt down his throat, forced ejection?"
311,ROBIN,"Oh. Hey.  Uh, what happened to you at the diner?  I turned around to take your order, and you were just … gone."
311,DEAN,"Long story.  Um, have you seen Timmy?"
311,ROBIN,"No, not yet, but he should be here any minute for his guitar lesson."
311,DEAN,"Yeah, we're gonna cancel that."
311,ROBIN,What?
311,DEAN,"We got to get out of here, okay?  I don't have time to explain.  You just got to trust me."
311,ROBIN,T-trust you?  (scoffs)  (sighs)  And why would I do that again?
311,DEAN,There were – there were reasons why I had to leave.  I don't have time to explain them to you right now.  I got to get you out of here.
311,ROBIN,Hey!   What are you doing?!
311,TIMMY,I'm sorry.
311,DEAN,"Sorry about what, Timmy?"
311,TIMMY,I can't stop it.
311,DEAN,"Go, go, go!"
311,DEAN,"Sam, go!"
311,DEAN,Locked.  Damn it!
311,DEAN,Circle.
311,ROBIN,"Dean, what – what just happened in there?"
311,DEAN,"Okay, listen to me.  Whatever happens, you stay inside this circle.  Understood?"
311,SAM,All right. Dean (warningly) ...
311,TIMMY,I can't control her.
311,DEAN,Can't control who?
311,TIMMY,"It was late, and we were driving home when we crashed in the woods. Everything was on fire.  But she saved me, pushed me out...  (in the memory we can hear her cries)   Before the car blew up... with her in it."
311,SAM,"But that's not all, was it?"
311,TIMMY,"I ran through the woods.  I found an empty building, where I hid.  I was scared. It was dark and cold.  So I cried.  I cried for my mom.  And then she came."
311,SAM,"But she'd changed, right?"
311,DEAN,"I'll bet she gave you that cool action figure, huh?"
311,TIMMY,Yeah. When I turned 9.
311,SAM,Timmy…
311,TIMMY,No!
311,SAM,"It looks like it wasn't the action figure that was anchoring her here, Dean."
311,DEAN,Then what is?!
311,SAM,Him.
311,SAM,You know what?   I think maybe his mom can't let go and she's still protecting him from the grave.
311,DEAN,"Protecting him from what?   What, from us?"
311,SAM,"Maybe she doesn't know what threats are real and what's not, so she just attacks all of them."
311,DEAN,"Great. So, what, unless we waste the kid, we're sitting ducks?"
311,ROBIN,This is – this is crazy.
311,DEAN,Robin.
311,DEAN,"Robin!   Damn it.  (DEAN chases her)  Robin, wait!  (DEAN catches her)"
311,ROBIN,Who are you?
311,DEAN,Right now I'm the only thing that's keeping you safe.
311,SAM,"Timmy, we're gonna need your help, okay?"
311,SAM,"Listen to me.  I need you to focus, okay?"
311,DEAN,Sammy!
311,TIMMY,I can't stop her.
311,DEAN,"Timmy, you have to try!"
311,TIMMY,She's my mom.
311,DEAN,"She's a ghost.  Timmy, because she can't move on, she's going crazy.  Okay? You got to let her go.  You'll be okay."
311,DEAN,"Timmy, Kung Fu grip!"
311,DEAN,Told you it was boring.
311,DEAN,"Well, as you can see, I did not run off to become a rock star."
311,ROBIN,"Mm... I don't know about that.  You look pretty rockin' to me, Dean Winchester."
311,DEAN,And what about you?
311,ROBIN,"I mean, I always thought that I would hate being in the same little town my whole life, and, you know, taking over the diner like Dad always wanted, but ... I don't.  I just – I love it."
311,DEAN,"I guess we didn't know everything we thought we did at 16, huh?"
311,ROBIN,Not everything.  Just some things.
311,SONNY,Sounds like Timmy's gonna need some help adjusting.
311,DEAN,"Yeah, but he's got you."
311,SONNY,"I always hate to see you go, Dee-dawg.  (They clasp hands.)  Can't thank you enough for this one, man.  (they hug.)"
311,DEAN,"Sonny, we'll see you around."
311,SONNY,"You can bet on that, boys.  Take it easy, man."
311,SAM,"Hey, h-how did you know Timmy asking his mom to leave was gonna work?"
311,DEAN,I didn't. Total hail Mary. Got lucky.
311,SAM,You just got lucky?
311,DEAN,Never felt right.
311,SAM,Really?
311,DEAN,"It was two months, Sam, okay?  And I couldn't wait to get out of here. I don't know what to tell you.  It wasn't me."
311,SONNY,"Oh, look at you.  You clean up good!"
311,SONNY,"Yeah.  Look, about that, Dean, your old man's outside …. and, man, he's really something. I tried to tell him what a big night it was for you, Dean, and ask him if he could come back later, but he just said to tell you he had a job, said you'd know what that means."
311,SAM,Dean ... Thank you.
311,DEAN,For what?
311,SAM,"For always being there, for – having my back.  Look, I know it always hasn't been easy …"
311,DEAN,I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
313,DEAN,A possession?
313,SAM,"I'm a mess, Dean.  You know it."
313,DEAN,I can't let you put this on yourself.
313,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,"I wouldn't do that, Dean."
313,DEAN,"So, he's better?"
313,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,Yes.  Sam is much improved.  It shouldn't be much longer now.
313,DEAN,"Okay, you know you said the same thing to me last week, right?"
313,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,As I told you when we met – this will take time.
313,DEAN,"Well, family business, Zeke. Okay? If we ignore this, Sam's gonna think that something fishy's going on."
313,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,(pause) Then I trust you will be discreet.
313,DEAN,"(pause) Wait, if you know where we're going, that means you've been listening in. Are you – are you hearing everything between me and Sam?"
313,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,"No. Just a word here and there. I have better things to do with my time than eavesdrop, like heal your brother. (pointedly)"
313,DEAN,"Okay, 'cause here's the thing—"
313,DEAN,What?
313,SAM,"That sign said ""Fort Collins, 50 miles."""
313,DEAN,So?
313,SAM,"So, last time I looked, like, 12 seconds ago, uh, Fort Collins was a hundred miles."
313,DEAN,"Well, like I've said—"
313,SAM,"Yes, the trials.  I know. I heard you.  I heard you when you said it the last week and the week before that and the week before that."
313,COP,"Ah, one of your guys is here already."
313,CASTIEL,"Um, (sotto voce) I still have that badge you gave me."
313,CASTIEL,"The murders were all over the news.  I, I thought I might be of help."
313,SAM,"Yeah, but Cas, you know that this is an angel situation, right? I mean, you left that night because angels were on your ass."
313,CASTIEL,"If angels are slaughtering one another, I have to do what I can to help.  It is a risk we should be willing to take, don't you think? (SAM shrugs in agreement, seeing the point.) Hey. Cas is back in town."
313,DEAN,"Seriously, did you – (to SAM) did he just say that?"
313,SAM,Definitely took more than one or two killers to pull this off.
313,DEAN,Hit squad?  Bartholomew's people?
313,SAM,"Well, Bartholomew has a faction we know about, but this could be somebody else entirely we don't know."
313,MALACHI,Where is he?
313,MALACHI,I called for a top-level summit.  I don't deal with hand maidens.
313,MALACHI,He'll regret the disrespect.
313,MALACHI,"Bartholomew's naked grab for power was nothing but disrespect! (voice raises angrily)  He and I ultimately want the same thing.  The only way we can take Heaven back from Metatron is to unite.  And if Bartholomew wants to avoid all-out warfare on Earth, he'll meet personally with me to negotiate terms."
313,MALACHI,"Yes, we are."
313,MALACHI,And so it begins.
313,SAM,Why wouldn't it be okay?
313,CASTIEL,"Hey, you once told me that you don't choose what you do. It chooses you."
313,DEAN,Huh?
313,CASTIEL,I'm a part of this.  (clinks beer bottles with DEAN) Like it or not.
313,SAM,"All right, well, then, in that case, we have to figure out, uh, who are we up against, what do they want, and how do we stop them."
313,CASTIEL,"Well, Bartholomew wants to reverse Metatron's spell.  Presumably to – to retake Heaven once his following is large enough.  That's according to April."
313,DEAN,The reaper you banged.
313,CASTIEL,"Yeah, and you stabbed."
313,CASTIEL,So hot. And very nice.
313,CASTIEL,Up to the point she started torturing me.
313,DEAN,"Yeah.  Well, not every hookup's perfect.  (DEAN pats CASTIEL’s arm companionably.)"
313,EZEKIEL-in-SAM,Well?  What are you going to do about this?
313,DEAN,About Cas?
313,EZEKIAL-in-SAM,"He is a beacon, Dean, pulling every angel for miles down on our heads."
313,DEAN,"All right, you know what, Zeke?  Level with me.  What is it that you're so afraid of?"
313,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,"I told you. When I chose to answer your prayers and heal Sam, I chose sides. That means I'm not in good standing with certain angels."
313,METATRON,"Well, I'm really looking forward to this."
313,EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,Excuse me?
313,METATRON,"Oh, please.  I know who you really are.  And it isn't Ezekiel."
313,DEAN,"Here's the deal.  When Sam was doing the trials to seal up Hell, it messed him up. Okay?  The third one nearly killed him. If I'd let him finish, it would have. He's still messed up, bad."
313,CASTIEL,"You said the angel, Ezekiel, helped heal him."
313,NOT-EZEKIEL-IN-SAM,"They say he is a good, and ... honorable angel."
313,METATRON,Ahhhh.  Everything they say you are not.  I see your point... Gadreel.
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,Not my doing.
313,METATRON,"Well, for whatever reason, the serpent entered. The Earth is cursed with evil. Someone had to be blamed."
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"What is it you want of me, Metatron?"
313,METATRON,(sighs)  Just to be your friend. You and I go back a long way. I was actually the one who freed you.
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,You?
313,METATRON,I was the one who caused all the angels to fall. Including the imprisoned ones.  You're welcome.
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,No angels are in Heaven?  None at all?
313,METATRON,"No, and you know, at first, I thought I would love it. But it's a big place. My solitude is getting tedious."
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,And so?
313,METATRON,"And so ... Plan ""B."" Rebuild Heaven as the place God envisioned it, only with a handpicked few. No more anemic functionaries like Bartholomew. And no more stupid angels.  (consideringly)  Maybe some funny ones.  You were His most trusted, Gadreel. You want to take back your reputation? You want to reclaim the Heaven that was?  We could do this together."
313,SAM,Any word from Cas?
313,DEAN,Nothing yet.
313,SAM,"And we're not ... worried about him, that he just took off like that again?  I mean, it's not like he does this kind of stuff alone."
313,DEAN,"It's the way he wanted it, honestly.  (looking at SAM, who looks unconvinced) Hey, look, man, he's been all over the map since he got his wings clipped. (changing the subject) What do you got? (rolls his chair over to SAM to look at his laptop)  Obituaries.  That one of the bikers?"
313,SAM,Yeah. His name was Red Dawg.
313,DEAN,Heh. Of course it was.
313,SAM,"It's not what you think. Look, he's a family guy. Big in the PTA, he played Santa at Christmas parties."
313,DEAN,"So, what? Just one day, he up and joined a biker gang?"
313,SAM,"No, he did that years ago. Get this. This is weird. Look. (pulling up news clippings and photos) These are all the victims, right? They were all baptized together."
313,DEAN,Baptized?
313,SAM,Yeah. They were a born-again biker gang.
313,DEAN,"Well, that is not something you hear every day."
313,SAM,"No, it's not."
313,SAM,"Listen to this.  Red Dawg's widow said he was always religious, but a week before he died, he came home from a prayer meeting and was a changed man filled with divine glory."
313,DEAN,"So, Boyle's at it again. Selling folks on being meat suits for angels."
313,SAM,Just what – talking to smaller groups now?
313,DEAN,"I don't know. Maybe, uh, softening up thousands at a time, he wasn't able to control what angels got let in. This way, Bartholomew's followers can jump in just as soon as Boyle does his thing."
313,SAM,"So, Red Dawg and his guys were Bartholomew people?"
313,DEAN,"Yeah, and they got slaughtered. Which means that this new group is even worse.  (pause) Haven't I always said that angels are dicks?"
313,METATRON,"Frankly, I never got used to them. I lived among them for centuries. I had to isolate myself to keep sane."
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"Humans do seem chaotic, Metatron."
313,METATRON,"Which makes them fascinating, but...  All that emotion.  Geez.  And the wasted energy.  It's just... exhausting."
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,I know.  Sam Winchester... It is a mess in here.  And the brother – I do not know where to start.
313,METATRON,I can free you from them.  From all of them.
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"You intend to be the ruler of this new Heaven, am I correct?"
313,METATRON,Uh... It is a burden I feel I must accept.
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"Then Metatron, does that not make you God?"
313,METATRON,"Oh-ho-ho.  Semantics.  I don't know that I'd take on THAT name...necessarily.  No.  When the time comes, we'll call me... ""X."""
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"""X""?"
313,METATRON,"You and I ... We could have paradise again, Gadreel."
313,CASTIEL,(exhales)
313,CASTIEL,You're an angel!
313,MURIEL,Muriel (she introduces herself).  I didn't pick the outfit.  (She stares in sudden recognition)  Castiel?  (and turns away to leave)
313,CASTIEL,"No, wait – please, just hear me out!"
313,MURIEL,It can't be known that I even spoke to you.
313,CASTIEL,I just need a moment.
313,MURIEL,No.
313,CASTIEL,Please.  I just need information.
313,KEVIN,"Dean, there may be nothing in here.  Crowley said the spell that cast down the angels was irreversible."
313,DEAN,"Yeah, well, screw Crowley.  Why would you think that anything he says is true?"
313,KEVIN,"This part is nearly indecipherable.  Almost like, when Metatron wrote it down, he wanted to keep the words hidden, even from Prophets."
313,DEAN,Hey.  Check this out.  Another angel attack.
313,SAM,What?  Where?
313,DEAN,"Utah.  A, uh, college, uh, Bible-study group and their, uh, their guest speaker – some top-shelf church lady.  Insides scorched out, kids' eyes were missing, but, not the church lady's."
313,SAM,"So, she was an angel, too?"
313,DEAN,"Sounds like.  Uh, and she sang soprano for the, uh, Melody Ministry Glee Club?"
313,SAM,Okay?
313,DEAN,"The club goes to its gigs on a bus, so when I checked with the Wyoming cops, they said that a witness saw the same bus leaving the biker bar not long before the bodies were found."
313,SAM,"So, church-lady angel was at both killings?"
313,DEAN,I'm guessing that she and whoever she's running with killed Bartholomew's bikers at the bar and then Bart's boys hit her back.
313,SAM,When she was recruiting those students to be vessels.  (sighs)  Wow. It's a bunch of kids.
313,DEAN,Kevin.  Clock's ticking.
313,MURIEL,Let's say you're telling the truth and Metatron tricked you.  I should still turn you in.
313,CASTIEL,But you won't.
313,MURIEL,Don't be so sure.
313,CASTIEL,I... I think you instinctively trust me.  We're similar.  We both want no part of the fanatics.
313,MURIEL,And when you prayed.  How did you know you wouldn't get one of them?
313,CASTIEL,"I'm warded, and my Grace is gone, and I was hoping that I would seem like just another desperate human that the... the militants couldn't care less about."
313,CASTIEL,"You're here.
You may know the situation.
Bartholomew, he's in a blood feud with another faction."
313,MURIEL,It's madness.
313,CASTIEL,Who leads the opposition?
313,MURIEL,Malachi.
313,CASTIEL,"Malachi?
The anarchist."
313,MURIEL,"He's become equals with Bartholomew.  In some ways, worse."
313,CASTIEL,But there's still those like you who want to stay out of it.
313,MURIEL,Fewer and fewer.  Each side is rounding up those who try and stay neutral.  Angels are being tortured and killed if they don't pledge loyalty.
313,CASTIEL,"(sighs) 
It's worse than I thought."
313,MURIEL,"Each side wants to crush the other, overthrow Metatron, and rule Heaven, and... Heaven under either of them would be..."
313,CASTIEL,Hell.
313,MALACHI,"This is a bonus, Castiel.  We were tracking Muriel, cowardly holdout that she is, (MURIEL is shown: She is bound, and bloody and bruised about the face.)  and wonder of wonders, she led us to you. (CASTIEL is also bloody and beaten.)"
313,MURIEL,Not knowingly.
313,MALACHI,I stand corrected.  Not knowingly.  Stupidly.
313,CASTIEL,"I've explained in detail.  I don't know how Metatron's spell worked.  Therefore, I can't assist in reversing it.  I was an unwitting accomplice."
313,CASTIEL,No.  I don't.
313,MALACHI,(sighs)  Theo.
313,CASTIEL,"No!  (THEO pulls his head back, and slides a silver angel knife down CASTIEL's chest) Ahhh, ahhh! (he groans in pain)."
313,CASTIEL,"No.  No, she's innocent.  You leave her alone."
313,MALACHI,Hm.  I have no intention of touching her.
313,MALACHI,Virtue is its own punishment.
313,CASTIEL,"Please, no!"
313,MURIEL,Nooooo!
313,CASTIEL,"Angels butchering angels.
Is this what we've become?"
313,THEO,"Don't ask for mercy.
There is none."
313,THEO,I'll give you one last chance for this to end.
313,CASTIEL,Give me a quick death.
313,THEO,"I need you to speak to Metatron.
Everyone knows you have influence."
313,CASTIEL,You – you serve Malachi.
313,THEO,"I thought he was the answer, but he's crazy."
313,CASTIEL,"You're... noticing this now?
You were more than willing to do his dirty work."
313,THEO,I did what I had to.
313,CASTIEL,When you were sure he would defeat Bartholomew.
313,THEO,But no one will survive this war.
313,CASTIEL,"So, you prefer to sit it out in Heaven."
313,THEO,I can talk to him about restoring your grace.
313,CASTIEL,"You're clever, Theo."
313,THEO,You're allies.
313,CASTIEL,"And he could use a skilled soldier like yourself.  (CASTIEL pretends to reconsider.) Oh, but I don't know."
313,THEO,"I-I'm a team player, Castiel."
313,CASTIEL,All right. Well? (gestures at his manacles; THEO opens them up)
313,CASTIEL,"I'll – I'll need a moment to make contact.  (THEO waits.)  
And you have something that I'll need."
313,THEO,Anything.
313,DEAN,Hey.  You seen Sam?
313,KEVIN,He went out.
313,DEAN,Where?
313,KEVIN,I don't know.  You notice he's doing that a lot?
313,DEAN,How do you know that?
313,CASTIEL,"He had me. I, uh, I was tortured. But I got away."
313,DEAN,How?
313,CASTIEL,I... I did what I had to. I became what they've become. A barbarian.
313,DEAN,"What are you – Cas, where are you?"
313,CASTIEL,"It's better I stay away. They're gonna want me even more now. But I'm gonna be all right. I... I got my Grace back. Well, not mine per se, but it'll do."
313,CASTIEL,I'm not sure. But I am an angel.
313,DEAN,And you're okay with that?
313,CASTIEL,"If we're going to war, I need to be ready."
313,CASTIEL,Dean. There's more.
313,DEAN,What?
313,CASTIEL,Didn't you say Sam was healed by an angel named Ezekiel?
313,DEAN,"Uh... Yeah, why?"
313,CASTIEL,Ezekiel is dead.
313,DEAN,What?
313,CASTIEL,He died when the angels fell.
313,DEAN,"All right, listen to me.
An angel can't be expelled by another human.
Okay, only by the host, right?
But, what if there was a way to power down the angel, so that it wasn't in charge for a few seconds?"
313,KEVIN,What?
313,DEAN,"For instance, if – if hypothetically, I wanted to speak with the vessel but not have the squatter listen in."
313,KEVIN,Why?
313,DEAN,"Why? Kevin, we've got tons of possessed humans out there. You with me? And when the angels kill each other off, the humans are taking it in the teeth.  So what if I wanted to clue the human in so that he, or she, could spit the angel out? That would be a good thing, right?"
313,KEVIN,Uh ... yeah?
313,DEAN,"Okay. So, hit the tablet. Let's go!  (DEAN turns to walk out.)"
313,KEVIN,Now?
313,DEAN,"Yesterday, Cinderella!"
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"I've been thinking this over, Metatron. I will join you as second in command."
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,I thank you for this opportunity.
313,METATRON,There is just one more thing.
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,Yes.
313,METATRON,I need to be sure of your fidelity.
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,You have it.
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,Slain?
313,METATRON,In a word.
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,That... That is not who I am.
313,METATRON,"(pulls a yellow card out of his pocket) 
Yeah. (sarcastically)"
313,METATRON,Decide.
313,DEAN,"All right, so this masterpiece we just painted – it's gonna work, right?"
313,KEVIN,The sigils are supposed to briefly hobble the possessing angel.  If the info's correct.
313,DEAN,"Wait, what?"
313,DEAN,I told you.
313,DEAN,"You're gonna have to trust me, okay, trust that I told you everything that I can for now.
Can you do that?"
313,DEAN,"Hey, where you been?"
313,SAM,Hey. Beer run.
313,SAM,Yeah.  Uh... Sure.
313,SAM,This sounds serious.
313,SAM,What's going on?  What are you doing?
313,DEAN,I got to tell you some stuff fast. It's gonna piss you off.
313,SAM,Okay.
313,DEAN,Those trials really messed you up.
313,SAM,"Yes, I know that, Dea—"
313,SAM,"Wait, what? When?"
313,DEAN,"You were in the hospital, okay, and they said you were gonna die."
313,SAM,What did you do?
313,SAM,In what?
313,DEAN,In you. He said he could heal you and he is.
313,SAM,"He's still in me?  Wait. (laughs)  That's impossible, Dean. That couldn't happen. I never invited him in."
313,DEAN,I tricked you into saying yes. It seemed like the only way.
313,SAM,"(sighs) So... Again. You thought I couldn't handle something, so you took over!"
313,DEAN,"No, I did what I had to do!  You would've never agreed to it, and you would've died."
313,SAM,"Well, maybe I would've liked the choice, at least."
313,DEAN,"We can do this – later. You can – you can kick my ass all you want. Right now, we got bigger problems."
313,SAM,Bigger?
313,DEAN,"The angel lied to me. Okay? He – he's not who he said he was. He said his name was Ezekiel. Cool guy, according to Cas, but it's not Ezekiel."
313,SAM,Who is he?
313,KEVIN,"Hey, do you notice anything a little bit off about Dean lately?
Between you and me, I'm a little bit worried about him."
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,Don't worry about Dean.  Dean will be fine.
313,DEAN,Sam?
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,There is no more Sam.
313,DEAN,(gasps in pain)
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,"But, I played him convincingly, I thought."
313,DEAN,How did you...
313,GADREEL-IN-SAM,I heard you talk with Kevin Tran tonight.
320,CROWLEY,"For the spell, to make the call."
325,CROWLEY,"Very illuminating, being inside your head. You really hate me."
326,CASTIEL,Sam and Dean may be a little rough... but they're the best men I've ever known.
