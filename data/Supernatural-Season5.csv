215,ANNA,—the sixty-six seals—
215,ANNA,Lucifer—
215,DEAN,You're possessing some poor bastard?
215,CASTIEL,This is a vessel.
215,DEAN,Chuck Shurley? We have a life.
215,CASTIEL,"Dean, let him go. This man is to be protected."
215,DEAN,Why?
215,CASTIEL,He's a prophet of the Lord.
215,CHUCK,Who are you?
215,ZACHARIAH,I'm Zachariah.
215,DEAN,And how'm I going to ice Lilith?
215,ZACHARIAH,You're not.
215,SAM,I'm sorry.
215,DEAN,"Sammy, let's go."
215,SAM,Dean—he's coming.
215,DEAN,Come on!
215,DEVIL,What the devil is your name?
215,DEVIL,Yosemite Sam?
215,DEVIL,"Let's see. Ah, here it is. I could use a guy like you."
215,DEAN,What the hell?
215,SAM,I don't know.
215,DEAN,Ilchester? Weren't we just there?
215,PILOT,"So if you'd like to stretch your legs, now would be a good time to—"
215,PILOT,Holy crap!
215,DEAN,Change the station.
215,SAM,"Dean, look—"
215,DEAN,Don't say anything.
215,DEAN,"It's okay. We just got to keep our heads down and hash this out, all right?"
215,SAM,"Yeah, okay."
215,DEAN,"All right, well, first things first—How did we end up on Soul Plane?"
215,SAM,"Angels, maybe? I mean, you know, beaming us out of harm's way?"
215,DEAN,"Well, whatever. It's the least of our worries. We need to find Cas."
215,SAM,Geez! Ow!
215,CHUCK,Sam.
215,SAM,Yeah!
215,DEAN,"Hey, Chuck."
215,CHUCK,So...you're okay?
215,SAM,"Well, my head hurts."
215,CHUCK,"No, I mean—I mean, my—My last vision."
215,CHUCK,"You went, like, full-on Vader."
215,CHUCK,Your body temperature was one-fifty. Your heart rate was two hundred. Your eyes were black.
215,DEAN,Your eyes went black?
215,SAM,I didn't know.
215,DEAN,Where's Cas?
215,CHUCK,He's dead. Or gone. The archangel smote the crap out of him. I'm sorry.
215,DEAN,"You're sure? I mean, maybe he just vanished into the light or something."
215,CHUCK,"Oh, no. He, like, exploded."
215,CHUCK,Like a water balloon of chunky soup.
215,SAM,You got a—
215,CHUCK,Uh...right here?
215,SAM,"Uh, the..."
215,CHUCK,"Oh. Oh, god."
215,CHUCK,Is that a molar?
215,CHUCK,Do I have a molar in my hair? This has been a really stressful day.
215,DEAN,"Cas, you stupid bastard."
215,SAM,Stupid? He was trying to help us.
215,DEAN,"Yeah, exactly."
215,SAM,"So, what now?"
215,DEAN,I don't know.
215,CHUCK,"Oh, crap."
215,SAM,What?
215,CHUCK,I can feel them.
215,ZACHARIAH,Thought we'd find you here.
215,ZACHARIAH,"Playtime's over, Dean. Time to come with us."
215,DEAN,"You just keep your distance, asshat."
215,ZACHARIAH,You're upset.
215,DEAN,Yeah. A little. You sons of bitches jump-started judgment day!
215,ZACHARIAH,Maybe we let it happen. We didn't start anything.
215,ZACHARIAH,"Right, Sammy?"
215,ZACHARIAH,"You had a chance to stop your brother, and you couldn't. So let's not quibble over who started what. Let's just say it was—"
215,ZACHARIAH,—all our faults and move on. 'Cause like it or not—
215,ZACHARIAH,—it's Apocalypse Now.
215,ZACHARIAH,And we're back on the same team again.
215,DEAN,Is that so?
215,ZACHARIAH,You want to kill the devil.
215,ZACHARIAH,We want you to kill the devil. It's...synergy.
215,DEAN,And I'm just supposed to trust you?
215,DEAN,"Cram it with walnuts, ugly."
215,ZACHARIAH,"This isn't a game, son."
215,ZACHARIAH,"Lucifer is powerful in ways that defy description. We need to strike now, hard and fast—before he finds his vessel."
215,SAM,His vessel? Lucifer needs a meat suit?
215,ZACHARIAH,He is an angel. Them's the rules.
215,ZACHARIAH,"And when he touches down, we're talking Four Horsemen, red oceans, fiery skies—"
215,ZACHARIAH,"—the greatest hits. You can stop him, Dean, but you need our help."
215,DEAN,"You listen to me, you two-faced douche."
215,DEAN,"After what you did, I don't want jack squat from you!"
215,ZACHARIAH,"You listen to me, boy! You think you can rebel against us? As Lucifer did?"
215,ZACHARIAH,You're bleeding.
215,DEAN,"Oh, yeah—a little insurance policy in case you dicks showed up."
215,ZACHARIAH,No!
215,DEAN,"Learned that from my friend Cas, you son of a bitch."
215,CHUCK,This sucks ass.
215,DEAN,Hey.
215,SAM,Hey.
215,SAM,"Here. Hex bags. No way the angels will find us with those. Demons, either, for that matter."
215,DEAN,Where'd you get it?
215,SAM,I made it.
215,DEAN,How?
215,SAM,I...I learned it from Ruby.
215,DEAN,Speaking of. How you doing? Are you jonesing for another hit of bitch blood or what?
215,SAM,"I-it's weird. Uh, tell you the truth, I'm fine. No shakes, no fever. It's like whoever...put me on that plane cleaned me right up."
215,DEAN,Supernatural methadone.
215,SAM,"Yeah, I guess."
215,SAM,Dean—
215,DEAN,Sam.
215,DEAN,It's okay. You don't have to say anything.
215,SAM,"Well, that's good. Because what can I even say? ""I'm sorry""? ""I screwed up""? Doesn't really do it justice, you know? Look, there's nothing I can do or say that will ever make this right—"
215,DEAN,So why do you keep bringing it up?!
215,DEAN,"Look, all I'm saying is, why do we have to put this under a microscope? We made a mess. We clean it up. That's it."
215,DEAN,"All right, so, say this is just any other hunt. You know? What do we do first?"
215,SAM,"We'd, uh, figure out where the thing is."
215,DEAN,All right. So we just got to find...the devil.
215,NICK,"All right, keep it together. Keep it together, man."
215,SARAH,"It's you, Nick. You're special. You're chosen."
215,BECKY,"""And then Sam touched—"" No. ""—caressed Dean's clavicle. 'This is wrong,' said Dean. 'Then I don't want to be right,' replied Sam, in a husky voice."""
215,BECKY,Oh...my...god. You. You're...
215,CHUCK,"Carver Edlund, yeah. Hi, Becky."
215,BECKY,You got my letters. And my marzipan.
215,CHUCK,"Yeah, yeah. Um...yummy. But, uh—"
215,BECKY,"I am your number-one fan. You know, I'm samlicker81."
215,CHUCK,I'm sorry. You're—You're what?
215,BECKY,Webmistress at morethanbrothers dot net?
215,CHUCK,"Oh. Yeah. No, yeah. You're my...number-one fan."
215,CHUCK,That's why I contacted you. You're the only one who will believe me.
215,BECKY,Are you all right?
215,CHUCK,"No. I'm being watched. Okay, not, not now—at least, I don't think so. But I don't have much time. I need your help."
215,BECKY,You need my help?
215,CHUCK,That's right. I need you to get a message to Sam and Dean. Okay?
215,CHUCK,"Becky, it's all real."
215,BECKY,I knew it!
215,SAM,"You okay, lady?"
215,BECKY,Sam...is it really you?
215,BECKY,And you're so firm.
215,SAM,"Uh, do I know you?"
215,BECKY,No. But I know you. You're Sam Winchester. And you're—
215,BECKY,—not what I pictured. I'm Becky.
215,BECKY,I read all about you guys. And I've even written a few—
215,BECKY,"Anyway, Mr. Edlund told me where you were."
215,DEAN,Chuck?
215,BECKY,"He's got a message, but he's being watched. Angels. Nice change-up to the mythology, by the way. The demon stuff was getting kind of old."
215,SAM,"Right. Just, um...what's the message?"
215,BECKY,"He had a vision. ""The Michael sword is on earth. The angels lost it."""
215,DEAN,The Michael sword?
215,SAM,"Becky, does he know where it is?"
215,BECKY,"In a castle, on a hill made of forty-two dogs."
215,DEAN,Forty-two dogs?
215,SAM,Are...you sure you got that right?
215,BECKY,"It doesn't make sense, but that's what he said."
215,BECKY,I memorized every word.
215,BECKY,For you.
215,SAM,"Um, Becky, c—uh, can you...quit touching me?"
215,BECKY,No.
215,DEAN,"Hey, Bobby."
215,BOBBY,Good to see you boys all in one piece.
215,DEAN,"You weren't followed, were you?"
215,BOBBY,"You mean by angels, demons, or Sam's new superfan?"
215,SAM,You heard.
215,BOBBY,"I heard, Romeo. So...sword of Michael, huh?"
215,DEAN,You think we're talking about the actual sword from the actual archangel?
215,BOBBY,You better friggin' hope so.
215,BOBBY,That's Michael. Toughest son of a bitch they got.
215,DEAN,You kidding me? Tough? That guy looks like Cate Blanchett.
215,BOBBY,"Well, I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley, believe me. He commands the heavenly host. During the last big dust-up upstairs, he's the one who booted Lucifer's ass to the basement. Did it with that sword."
215,BOBBY,So if we can find it...
215,SAM,"We can kick the devil's ass all over again. All right. So, where do we start?"
215,BOBBY,Divvy up and start reading—try and make sense of Chuck's nonsense.
215,BOBBY,Kid? You all right?
215,SAM,"No, actually. Bobby, this is all my fault. I'm sorry."
215,DEAN,Sam...
215,SAM,Lilith did not break the final seal. Lilith was the final seal.
215,DEAN,"Sam, stop it."
215,SAM,"I killed her, and I set Lucifer free."
215,BOBBY,You what?
215,SAM,"You guys warned me about Ruby, the demon blood, but I didn't listen. I brought this on."
215,BOBBY,You're damn right you didn't listen. You were reckless and selfish and arrogant.
215,SAM,I'm sorry.
215,BOBBY,"Oh, yeah? You're sorry you started Armageddon? This kind of thing don't get forgiven, boy. If, by some miracle, we pull this off...I want you to lose my number. You understand me?"
215,SAM,There's an old church nearby. Maybe I'll go read some of the lore books there.
215,BOBBY,Yeah. You do that.
215,BOBBY,I never would have guessed that your daddy was right.
215,DEAN,About what?
215,BOBBY,About your brother.
215,BOBBY,What John said—you save Sam or kill him. Maybe...
215,DEAN,Maybe what?
215,BOBBY,Maybe we shouldn't have tried so hard to save him.
215,DEAN,Bobby.
215,BOBBY,"He ended the world, Dean. And you and I weren't strong enough to stop him proper. That's on us. I'm just saying, your dad was right."
215,DEAN,Dad.
215,DEAN,It's got to be in here somewhere.
215,BOBBY,What the hell are you talking about?
215,DEAN,Here.
215,DEAN,I don't believe it.
215,BOBBY,What the hell is it?
215,DEAN,It's a card for my dad's lockup in upstate New York. Read it.
215,BOBBY,"""Castle Storage. 42 Rover Hill."""
215,DEAN,Castle on a hill of forty-two dogs.
215,BOBBY,So you think your dad had the Michael sword all this time?
215,DEAN,I don't know. I'm not sure what else Chuck could have meant.
215,BOBBY,Yeah. Okay. It's good enough for me.
215,DEAN,Ruby.
215,DEAN,Meg?
215,MEG,"Hi. These are the days of miracle and wonder, Dean. Our father's among us. You know we're all dreaming again for the first time since we were human? It's heaven on earth. Or hell. We really owe your brother a fruit basket."
215,DEAN,"My god, you like the sound of your own voice."
215,MEG,"But you, on the other hand, you're the only bump in the road. So every demon—every single one—is just dying for a piece of you."
215,DEAN,Get in line.
215,MEG,"Oh, I'm in the front of the line, baby. Let's ride."
215,DEAN,"What is that, peanut butter?"
215,MEG,"You know, your surrogate daddy's still awake screaming in there. And I want him to know how it feels slicing the life out of you."
215,DEAN,Bobby!
215,MEG,Now!
215,DEAN,Bobby! No!
215,SAM,No!
215,MEG,"Heya, Sammy. You miss me? 'Cause I sure missed you."
215,SAM,Meg?
215,MEG,"It's not so easy without those super-special demon powers, huh, Sammy?"
215,NICK,No...
215,DEAN,Need some help here!
215,NURSE,What happened?
215,SAM,He was stabbed.
215,NURSE,Can we get a gurney?
215,DEAN,"Hang on, Bobby. Hang in there. You're gonna be okay."
215,NURSE,Just wait here.
215,SAM,We can't just leave him.
215,NURSE,Just don't move. I've got questions.
215,DEAN,"Sammy, we got to go."
215,SAM,"No. No way, Dean."
215,DEAN,"The demons heard where the sword is. We got to get to it before they do, if we're not too late already. Come on!"
215,ZACHARIAH,I see you told the demons where the sword is.
215,DEAN,"Oh, thank god. The angels are here."
215,ZACHARIAH,And to think...they could have grabbed it any time they wanted.
215,ZACHARIAH,It was right in front of them.
215,SAM,What do you mean?
215,ZACHARIAH,"We may have planted that particular piece of prophecy inside Chuck's skull, but it happened to be true. We did lose the Michael sword. We truly couldn't find it. Until now. You've just hand-delivered it to us."
215,DEAN,We don't have anything.
215,ZACHARIAH,"It's you, chucklehead. You're the Michael sword."
215,ZACHARIAH,"What, you thought you could actually kill Lucifer? You simpering wad of insecurity and self-loathing? No. You're just a human, Dean. And not much of one."
215,DEAN,"What do you mean, I'm the sword?"
215,ZACHARIAH,"You're Michael's weapon. Or, rather, his...receptacle."
215,DEAN,I'm a vessel?
215,DEAN,How? Why—why me?
215,ZACHARIAH,"Because you're chosen! It's a great honor, Dean."
215,DEAN,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, life as an angel condom. That's real fun. I think I'll pass, thanks."
215,ZACHARIAH,Joking. Always joking. Well...no more jokes.
215,ZACHARIAH,Bang.
215,SAM,God!
215,DEAN,You son of a bitch!
215,ZACHARIAH,"Keep mouthing off, I'll break more than his legs. I am completely and utterly through screwing around. The war has begun. We don't have our general. That's bad. Now, Michael is going to take his vessel and lead the final charge against the adversary. You understand me?"
215,DEAN,"How many humans die in the crossfire, huh? A million? Five, ten?"
215,ZACHARIAH,"Probably more. If Lucifer goes unchecked, you know how many die? All of them. He'll roast the planet alive."
215,DEAN,There's a reason you're telling me this instead of just nabbing me. You need my consent. Michael needs my say-so to ride around in my skin.
215,ZACHARIAH,"Unfortunately, yes."
215,DEAN,"Well, there's got to be another way."
215,ZACHARIAH,There is no other way. There must be a battle. Michael must defeat the serpent. It is written.
215,DEAN,"Yeah, maybe. But, on the other hand... Eat me. The answer's no."
215,ZACHARIAH,"Okay. How about this? Your friend Bobby—we know he's gravely injured. Say yes, and we'll heal him. Say no, he'll never walk again."
215,DEAN,No.
215,ZACHARIAH,Then how about we heal you from...stage-four stomach cancer?
215,DEAN,No.
215,ZACHARIAH,"Then let's get really creative. Uh, let's see how...Sam does without his lungs."
215,ZACHARIAH,"Are we having fun yet? You're going to say yes, Dean."
215,DEAN,Just kill us.
215,ZACHARIAH,"Kill you? Oh, no. I'm just getting started."
215,ZACHARIAH,How are you...
215,CASTIEL,"Alive? That's a good question. How did these two end up on that airplane? Another good question. 'Cause the angels didn't do it. I think we both know the answer, don't we?"
215,ZACHARIAH,No. That's not possible.
215,CASTIEL,"It scares you. Well, it should. Now, put these boys back together and go. I won't ask twice."
215,CASTIEL,You two need to be more careful.
215,DEAN,"Yeah, I'm starting to get that. Your frat brothers are bigger dicks than I thought."
215,CASTIEL,"I don't mean the angels. Lucifer is circling his vessel. And once he takes it, those hex bags won't be enough to protect you."
215,DEAN,What the hell was that?
215,CASTIEL,"An Enochian sigil. It'll hide you from every angel in creation, including Lucifer."
215,DEAN,"What, did you just brand us with it?"
215,CASTIEL,No. I carved it into your ribs.
215,SAM,"Hey, Cas, were you really dead?"
215,CASTIEL,Yes.
215,DEAN,Then how are you back?
215,SARAH,Nick.
215,SARAH,"Nick. You're dreaming, Nick. But it doesn't mean this isn't real."
215,NICK,Sarah?
215,SARAH,"I'm not your wife, Nick. I'm an angel."
215,NICK,An angel?
215,SARAH,My name is Lucifer.
215,NICK,"Sure. Naturally. Um... Could you do me a favor there, Satan, and remind me to quit drinking before I go to bed?"
215,LUCIFER,"I'm here because you're special, Nick. There's very, very few people like you."
215,NICK,Is that so?
215,LUCIFER,You're a vessel—a very powerful vessel.
215,NICK,"Meaning what, exactly?"
215,LUCIFER,"I need to take control of your mind and your body. To be honest, it'll probably be unpleasant for you. But it is necessary."
215,NICK,"Okay, look...if it's just the same to you, I think I'd like to wake up now."
215,LUCIFER,I told you—this is real. Don't be afraid. This is your choice.
215,LUCIFER,You need to invite me in.
215,NICK,"Even if this is real—which it's not, but assuming it was...why the hell would I do something like that?"
215,LUCIFER,"You people misunderstand me. You call me ""Satan"" and ""devil"", but... Do you know my crime? I loved God too much. And for that, he betrayed me—punished me. Just as he's punished you. After all, how could God stand idly by while that man broke into your home and butchered your family in their beds?"
215,LUCIFER,"There are only two rational answers, Nick—either he's sadistic, or he simply doesn't care. You're angry. You have every right to be angry. I am angry, too. That's why I want to find him—hold him accountable for his actions. Just because he created us doesn't mean he can toy with us, like playthings."
215,NICK,If I help you...can you bring back my family?
215,LUCIFER,"I'm sorry. I can't. But I can give you the next best thing. God did this to you, Nick. And I can give you justice. Peace."
215,NICK,How do I know you're telling the truth?
215,LUCIFER,"Because, contrary to popular belief, I don't lie. I don't need to. What I need...is you. Nick, I need you to say yes."
215,NICK,Then yes.
215,BOBBY,"""Unlikely to walk again""?! Why, you snot-nosed son of a bitch! Wait till I get out of this bed!"
215,BOBBY,"I'll use my game leg and kick your friggin' ass! Yeah, you better run!"
215,BOBBY,You believe that yahoo?
215,DEAN,Screw him. You'll be fine.
215,SAM,"So, let me ask the million-dollar question. What do we do now?"
215,BOBBY,"Well... We save as many as we can for as long as we can, I guess. It's bad. Whoever wins, heaven or hell, we're boned."
215,DEAN,What if we win?
215,DEAN,"I'm serious. I mean, screw the angels and the demons and their crap apocalypse. Hell, they want to fight a war, they can find their own planet. This one's ours, and I say they get the hell off it. We take 'em all on. We kill the devil. Hell, we even kill Michael if we have to. But we do it our own damn selves."
215,BOBBY,"And how are we supposed to do all this, genius?"
215,DEAN,"I got no idea. But what I do have is a GED and a give-'em-hell attitude, and I'll figure it out."
215,BOBBY,"You are nine kinds of crazy, boy."
215,DEAN,It's been said.
215,DEAN,"Listen, you stay on the mend. We'll see you in a bit."
215,BOBBY,Sam?
215,SAM,"Thanks, Bobby."
215,BOBBY,"You're welcome. I deserve a damn medal for this, but...you're welcome."
215,SAM,"You know, I was thinking, Dean—maybe we could go after the Colt."
215,DEAN,Why? What difference would that make?
215,SAM,"Well, we could use it on Lucifer. I mean, you just said back there—"
215,DEAN,I just said a bunch of crap for Bobby's benefit.
215,DEAN,"I mean, I'll fight. I'll fight till the last man, but let's at least be honest. I mean, we don't stand a snowball's chance, and you know that. I mean, hell, you of all people know that."
215,SAM,Dean...
215,SAM,Is there something you want to say to me?
215,DEAN,"I tried, Sammy. I mean, I really tried. But I just can't keep pretending that everything's all right. Because it's not. And it's never going to be. You chose a demon over your own brother—"
215,DEAN,—and look what happened.
215,SAM,I would give anything—anything—to take it all back.
215,DEAN,"I know you would. And I know how sorry you are. I do. But, man...you were the one that I depended on the most. And you let me down in ways that I can't even..."
215,DEAN,I'm just—I'm having a hard time forgiving and forgetting here. You know?
215,SAM,What can I do?
215,DEAN,Honestly? Nothing.
215,DEAN,I just don't...I don't think that we can ever be what we were. You know?
215,DEAN,I just don't think I can trust you.
216,SAM,What? What did I do?
216,RUBY,You opened the door.
216,DEAN,"You jonesing for another hit of bitch blood, or what?"
216,ZACHARIAH,You're the Michael sword.
216,DEAN,"What do you mean, I'm the sword?"
216,ZACHARIAH,You're Michael's weapon.
216,DEAN,I'm a vessel?
216,RUFUS,I'm what you've got to look forward to if you survive.
216,DEAN,Need some help here!
216,DEAN,What the hell was that?
216,CASTIEL,An Enochian sigil. It'll hide you from—
216,CASTIEL,"—every angel in creation, including Lucifer."
216,DEAN,"Ellen, this is my fault."
216,DEAN,But Jo did good out there.
216,JO,You're angry. I understand.
216,ELLEN,Angry? 'Angry' doesn't begin to touch it!
216,JO,"Is this about me hunting, or something else?"
216,DEAN,You chose a demon over your own brother. I just don't think I can trust you.
216,DEAN,It's been like three days now?
216,DEAN,We got to cheer him up. Maybe I'll give him a backrub.
216,SAM,Dean.
216,DEAN,"Well, what, then?"
216,SAM,Look...we might have to wrap our heads around the idea that Bobby might not just bounce back this time.
216,SAM,What's in the envelope?
216,DEAN,Went to radiology.
216,DEAN,Got some glamour shots.
216,DEAN,Let's just say the doctors are baffled.
216,SAM,Holy crap.
216,DEAN,"Yeah, well, Cas carved you one, too."
216,SAM,Hello? ...Castiel?
216,DEAN,Speak of the devil.
216,SAM,"Ah, St. Martin's Hospital. Why? What are you—Cas?"
216,DEAN,"Cell phone, Cas? Really? Since when do angels need to reach out and touch someone?"
216,CASTIEL,You're hidden from angels now—all angels. I won't be able to simply—
216,BOBBY,Enough foreplay.
216,BOBBY,Get over here and lay your damn hands on.
216,BOBBY,Get healing. Now.
216,CASTIEL,I can't.
216,BOBBY,Say again?
216,CASTIEL,I'm cut off from heaven and much of heaven's power. Certain things I can do. Certain things I can't.
216,BOBBY,You're telling me you lost your mojo just in time to get me stuck in this trap the rest of my life?
216,CASTIEL,I'm sorry.
216,BOBBY,Shove it up your ass.
216,DEAN,At least he's talking now.
216,BOBBY,I heard that.
216,CASTIEL,I don't have much time. We need to talk.
216,DEAN,Okay.
216,CASTIEL,Your plan to kill Lucifer.
216,DEAN,Yeah. You want to help?
216,CASTIEL,No. It's foolish. It can't be done.
216,DEAN,Oh. Thanks for the support.
216,CASTIEL,But I believe I have the solution. There is someone besides Michael strong enough to take on Lucifer. Strong enough to stop the apocalypse.
216,SAM,Who's that?
216,CASTIEL,The one who resurrected me and put you on that airplane. The one who began everything. God.
216,CASTIEL,I'm gonna find God.
216,DEAN,God?
216,CASTIEL,Yes.
216,DEAN,God.
216,CASTIEL,Yes! He isn't in heaven. He has to be somewhere.
216,DEAN,Try New Mexico. I hear he's on a tortilla.
216,CASTIEL,"No, he's not on any flatbread."
216,DEAN,"Listen, Chuckles, even if there is a God, he is either dead—and that's the generous theory—"
216,CASTIEL,"He is out there, Dean."
216,DEAN,—or he's up and kicking and doesn't give a rat's ass about any of us.
216,DEAN,"I mean, look around you, man. The world is in the toilet. We are literally—"
216,DEAN,"—at the end of days here, and he's off somewhere drinking booze out of a coconut. All right?"
216,CASTIEL,Enough.
216,CASTIEL,This is not a theological issue. It's strategic.
216,CASTIEL,"With God's help, we can win."
216,DEAN,"It's a pipe dream, Cas."
216,CASTIEL,"I killed two angels this week. My brothers. I'm hunted. I rebelled. And I did it, all of it, for you, and you failed. You and your brother destroyed the world—"
216,CASTIEL,"—and I lost everything, for nothing. So keep your opinions to yourself."
216,BOBBY,You didn't drop in just to tear us a new hole. What is it you want?
216,CASTIEL,I did come for something. An amulet.
216,BOBBY,An amulet? What kind?
216,CASTIEL,Very rare. Very powerful.
216,CASTIEL,It burns hot in God's presence. It'll help me find him.
216,SAM,A God EMF?
216,BOBBY,"Well, I don't know what you're talking about. I got nothing like that."
216,CASTIEL,I know. You don't.
216,DEAN,"What, this?"
216,CASTIEL,May I borrow it?
216,DEAN,No.
216,CASTIEL,Dean. Give it to me.
216,DEAN,"All right, I guess."
216,DEAN,Don't lose it.
216,DEAN,Great. Now I feel naked.
216,CASTIEL,I'll be in touch.
216,BOBBY,"When you find God, tell him to send legs!"
216,RUFUS,"Your belt, your belt!"
216,RUFUS,Hey. Hey! Hold this.
216,BOBBY,Hello?
216,RUFUS,"Bobby. Bobby, damn it, can you hear me?"
216,BOBBY,I can't hear you.
216,RUFUS,"Listen. I'm gonna need a little help here. Seems I'm up to my ass in demons. Whole damn town's infested. Hang on, hang on—"
216,BOBBY,Where are you?
216,RUFUS,"River Pass, Colorado."
216,BOBBY,Colora—Colorado?
216,RUFUS,Colorado!
216,BOBBY,"River Pass, Colorado?"
216,RUFUS,River Pass!
216,BOBBY,Rufus? You there? Ruf—Rufus?
216,RUFUS,"Bobby, it's—"
216,DEAN,This is the only road in or out.
216,SAM,No signal.
216,DEAN,Rufus was right. Demons got this place locked down.
216,SAM,Looks like we're hiking in.
216,DEAN,And the hits just keep on coming.
216,SAM,Ellen?
216,ELLEN,"Hello, boys."
216,DEAN,"Ellen, what the heck's going on here?"
216,DEAN,We're us.
216,ELLEN,Real glad to see you boys.
216,ELLEN,The can of whoopass I ought to open on you.
216,DEAN,Ow!
216,ELLEN,"You can't pick up a phone? What are you, allergic to giving me peace of mind? I got to find out that you're alive from Rufus?"
216,DEAN,"Sorry, Ellen."
216,ELLEN,"Yeah, you better be. You better put me on speed dial, kid."
216,DEAN,"Yes, ma'am."
216,DEAN,"What's going on, Ellen?"
216,ELLEN,More than I can handle alone.
216,SAM,How many demons are there?
216,ELLEN,"Pretty much the whole town, minus the dead people and these guys."
216,ELLEN,"So, this is it, right? End times?"
216,ELLEN,It's got to be.
216,SAM,Seems like it.
216,ELLEN,It's me.
216,ELLEN,This is Sam and Dean. They're hunters. Here to help.
216,AUSTIN,You guys hip to this whole demon thing?
216,DEAN,Yeah. Are you?
216,ROGER,My wife's eyes turned black. She came at me with a brick. Kind of makes you embrace the paranormal.
216,DEAN,"All right, catch us up."
216,ELLEN,"I doubt I know much more than you. Rufus called. Said he was in town investigating omens. All of a sudden, the whole town was possessed. Me and Jo were nearby—"
216,DEAN,You're hunting with Jo?
216,ELLEN,"Yeah, for a while now. We got here, and the place—well, the place was like you see it. Couldn't find Rufus, then me and Jo got separated. I was out looking when I found you."
216,DEAN,"Don't worry, we'll find her."
216,SAM,"Either way, these people cannot just sit here."
216,SAM,We got to get them out now.
216,ELLEN,"No, it's not that easy. I've been trying. We already made a run for it once."
216,SAM,What happened?
216,ELLEN,There used to be twenty of us.
216,ELLEN,You don't know what it's like out there. Demons are everywhere. We won't be able to cover everybody.
216,SAM,What if we get everyone guns?
216,DEAN,"What, are you gonna arm up baby bump over here?"
216,SAM,"More salt we can fire at once, more demons we can keep away."
216,DEAN,There's a sporting goods store we passed on Main on the way in. I bet they got guns.
216,SAM,All right. You stay. We'll go.
216,ELLEN,What about—
216,SAM,"If Jo and Rufus are out there, we'll bring them back."
216,DEAN,Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Hold on.
216,DEAN,Why don't I just go?
216,SAM,What? Alone?
216,DEAN,"Well, yeah. Somebody's got to stay here and start giving them Shotgun 101."
216,SAM,Yeah. Ellen.
216,DEAN,"No no no. It's gonna go a lot faster if you stay and help, okay?"
216,DEAN,I can handle it.
216,SAM,You don't want me going out there.
216,DEAN,I didn't say that.
216,SAM,Around demons.
216,DEAN,I didn't say that.
216,SAM,"Fine, then let's go."
216,SAM,I'll get the salt. You get the guns.
216,DEAN,We'll go together.
216,SAM,"Dean, it's right there. Can we at least do this like professionals?"
216,SAM,"Exorcisamus te, omnis immundus—"
216,DEAN,Sammy?
216,ROGER,"Okay, all right."
216,ELLEN,"Roger, hang on a second—"
216,ROGER,Sorry.
216,SAM,—then snap it in.
216,DEAN,You know your way around a gun at all?
216,DEAN,Hm. Where'd you serve?
216,AUSTIN,Fallujah. Two tours. Got back a little over a year ago. Takes one to know one. Where'd you serve?
216,DEAN,Hell.
216,AUSTIN,"No, seriously."
216,DEAN,Seriously. Hell.
216,DEAN,Hey.
216,SAM,Hey.
216,DEAN,What's wrong?
216,SAM,"It's just...at the store. Those demons were possessing teenagers. I mean, I had to slit some kid's throat."
216,DEAN,"Come on, Sam, you had to."
216,SAM,I know. I just...it used to be like...
216,SAM,I just wish I could save people like I used to.
216,DEAN,"What, you mean when you were all hopped up on demon blood?"
216,SAM,I didn't say that.
216,ELLEN,I'll be back.
216,DEAN,Where you going?
216,ELLEN,"I can't sit here on my ass. My daughter's out there somewhere. I'm not back in half an hour, go. Get these people out of here."
216,SAM,"No, wait. I'll go with you."
216,DEAN,"Whoa, hold on. Can I talk to you for a second?"
216,DEAN,You're gonna go out there again?
216,SAM,"Well, crap doesn't hit the fan with coffee breaks."
216,DEAN,I'll go.
216,SAM,"It's fine. Just stay here, get 'em ready. I'll cover Ellen."
216,DEAN,Why's it got to be you?
216,SAM,"Oh, that's right, I forgot. You think I'll take one look at a demon and suddenly fall off the wagon, as if, after everything, I haven't learned my lesson."
216,DEAN,"Well, have you?"
216,SAM,If you actually think I—
216,SAM,So where'd you see her last?
216,ELLEN,Up ahead. So what's up with you and Dean?
216,ELLEN,"It was hard not to notice, how different things are between you guys these days."
216,ELLEN,"Lot of bad road there, huh? What happened? Some girl come between you or something?"
216,SAM,"Just—stresses of the job. You know how it is. Kind of surprised, you and Jo hunting. Weren't you always saying she couldn't hack the life?"
216,ELLEN,She can't. But if she's gonna do it anyway—
216,SAM,You want to keep an eye on her.
216,SAM,Hey.
216,ELLEN,Is that a chimney going?
216,SAM,Looks like it. Come on.
216,ELLEN,Guess we found base camp.
216,SAM,Demons don't get cold. Makes you wonder what they're burning.
216,JO,"Don't move, you evil skank!"
216,ELLEN,"Don't you hurt her, don't you—"
216,JO,"Give me my mom back, you black-eyed bitch!"
216,SAM,Ellen! Run!
216,RUFUS,"Got you now, you bastard."
216,RUFUS,"Uh-uh. No way you're getting out of those. Did you up myself. You're stuck right where I want you, you evil son of a bitch."
216,SAM,"No, wait, wait, wait."
216,SAM,"Just, just wait."
216,RUFUS,"Exorcisamus te, exorcisamus te, omnis satanica—"
216,SAM,Stop!
216,RUFUS,—omnis immundum—
216,SAM,Please!
216,PASTOR,"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He layeth me down in green pastures, and he raiseth me up again. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil."
216,DEAN,Where's Sam?
216,PASTOR,Could they get in?
216,DEAN,No.
216,DEAN,Everybody sit tight. I got to—
216,DEAN,"Okay, we need to get a plan together. Tell me everything."
216,SAM,Please! Come on!
216,RUFUS,—omnis immundus—
216,SAM,Look! Something's not right! Do you see that?
216,SAM,Come on! Stop! Listen to me!
216,SAM,Listen!
216,JO,Why isn't it working?
216,RUFUS,I don't know.
216,SAM,"Look, listen to me, something's not right!"
216,RUFUS,But he's not as strong as he thinks he is.
216,SAM,You can see that. Please. Please. Just listen to me.
216,ELLEN,"Dean, one of them's in Jo. We got to get it out without hurting her."
216,ELLEN,It called me a bitch.
216,DEAN,"Bruise a little easy, don't you think?"
216,ELLEN,"No, that's not what I meant. It called me a black-eyed bitch."
216,ELLEN,"What kind of demons are these? Holy water and salt roll right off. My daughter may be an idiot, but she's not stupid. She wears an anti-possession charm. It's all kind of weird, right?"
216,DEAN,The whole thing's off.
216,ELLEN,What's your instinct?
216,DEAN,My instinct? My instinct is to call Bobby and ask for help. Or Sam.
216,ELLEN,"Well, tough. All you got's me, and all I got's you. So let's figure it out."
216,DEAN,All right.
216,DEAN,Do you know why Rufus came to town? Was there a specific omen?
216,ELLEN,He said something about water. That's all I know.
216,DEAN,"Padré, you know what she's talking about—the water?"
216,PASTOR,The river. Ran polluted all of a sudden.
216,DEAN,When?
216,AUSTIN,Last Wednesday. And the demon thing started up the next day.
216,DEAN,Anything else? Anything.
216,AUSTIN,"Maybe, but it's pretty random."
216,DEAN,Good. Random's good.
216,AUSTIN,Shooting star—does that count?
216,AUSTIN,Real big. Same night. Wednesday.
216,DEAN,That definitely counts.
216,AUSTIN,"So, uh, you think that all this comes from outer space?"
216,DEAN,"""And there fell a great star from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell upon the river, and the name of the star was Wormwood. And many men died."""
216,PASTOR,Revelation eight ten. Are you saying that this is about the apocalypse?
216,DEAN,"You could say. And these specific omens, they're prelude to what?"
216,PASTOR,The Four Horsemen.
216,DEAN,And which one rides the red horse?
216,PASTOR,War.
216,DEAN,That cherry Mustang parked on Main.
216,PASTOR,You can't think that a car—
216,DEAN,"It's the way I'd roll. I mean, think about it. It all makes sense. If War is a dude and he's here, maybe he's messing with our heads."
216,ELLEN,Turning us on each other.
216,DEAN,"You said Jo called you a black-eyed bitch. They think we're demons, we think they're demons. What if there are no demons at all and we're all just killing each other?"
216,PASTOR,"Wait, just back up. It's the apocalypse?"
216,DEAN,"Sorry, Padré."
216,SAM,Who the hell are you?
216,SAM,What are you?
216,'ROGER',You caught me. Popped in to watch. I can hustle like that.
216,SAM,"So, the Roger everyone around here knows, the real Roger?"
216,'ROGER',Buried in a ditch.
216,SAM,So who are you?
216,'ROGER',Here's a hint. I was in Germany. Then in Germany. Then in the Middle East. I was in Darfur when my beeper went off. I'm waiting to hook up with my siblings. I've got three. We're going to have so much fun together.
216,SAM,"I know who you are. There aren't any demons in town, are there?"
216,WAR,"Nope. Just frightened people ripping each other's throats out. I really haven't had to do too much. Take out a bridge here, lay in a little hallucination there, sit back, pop some corn, watch the show. Frankly, you're really vicious little animals, Sam."
216,SAM,No. You're doing this.
216,WAR,"Please. Last week, this was Mayberry. Now these people are stabbing each other's children."
216,SAM,'Cause you made them see demons!
216,WAR,"Honestly, people don't need a reason to kill each other. I mean, you seen the Irish? They're all Irish."
216,WAR,You think I'm a monster. I'm jello shots at a party. I just remove inhibitions.
216,SAM,I'm gonna kill you myself.
216,WAR,"Oh, that's adorable, considering you're my poster boy."
216,SAM,What's that supposed to mean?
216,WAR,"You can't stop thinking about it, ever since you saw it dripping off the blade of that knife."
216,SAM,You're wrong.
216,WAR,"Save your protests for your brother. I can see inside your head. And man, it is one-track city in there. Blood, blood, blood. Lust for power. Same as always. You want to be strong again. But not just strong. Stronger than everybody. Good intentions—quick slide to hell, buddy boy. You feel bad now? Wait till you're thigh deep in warm corpses. Because, my friend, I'm just getting started."
216,WAR,Showtime for the meatsuits. Watch this.
216,WAR,He did it!
216,SAM,No!
216,WAR,He said they're coming! He said they're coming to get us!
216,SAM,"No, stop! Jo, Rufus, he's lying! No!"
216,RUFUS,You shut your mouth!
216,SAM,Please! Jo! He's lying!
216,AUSTIN,So now you're saying that there are no demons and war is a guy.
216,DEAN,You believed crazy before.
216,WAR,Open up! It's Roger!
216,WAR,"I saw them, the demons. They know we're trying to leave. They said they're gonna pick us off one by one."
216,DEAN,Wait wait wait. What?
216,AUSTIN,I thought you said there were no demons.
216,DEAN,There's not. Where did you go?
216,WAR,I thought someone should go out and see what's going on!
216,DEAN,Where did you see the demons and what did they say exactly?
216,AUSTIN,"We just sit here, we're going to be dead."
216,DEAN,"No, we're not!"
216,WAR,They're gonna kill us unless we kill them first.
216,DEAN,Hold on. Hold on.
216,AUSTIN,"No, man, we got people to protect. All right, the able-bodied go hunt some demons."
216,DEAN,Whoa whoa whoa. Slow your roll. This is not a demon thing.
216,WAR,Look at their eyes! They're demons!
216,DEAN,"Go, go!"
216,DEAN,Move!
216,WAR,Those are real.
216,AUSTIN,"Those two could have been demons the entire time. All this salt and holy water talk—as far as I'm concerned, it's all crap."
216,WAR,Are you sure?
216,AUSTIN,It's them or us.
216,WAR,I think I saw some knives in the kitchen.
216,AUSTIN,Great. Go.
216,JO,"Hey, Rufus."
216,RUFUS,Yeah.
216,JO,Pipe bombs won't kill a demon.
216,RUFUS,"Right. But in my experience, demons come at you slower if they're in a body with no limbs."
216,JO,One of them is in my mother.
216,RUFUS,"Jo, listen to me. You know I'm gonna do everything I can. Your mom's gonna be okay."
216,JO,Unless she comes through that window.
216,AUSTIN,"All right, let's move."
216,JO,Rufus!
216,ELLEN,"Now you listen up, Joanna Beth Harvelle."
216,DEAN,"Listen to me. I'm not a demon. Think, Rufus. All those omens."
216,RUFUS,You go to hell.
216,DEAN,"Rufus! The polluted water, the shooting star, the red Mustang—it's War. I'm telling you, it's War."
216,RUFUS,You're damn right it is.
216,DEAN,The Horseman!
216,RUFUS,Horseman?
216,DEAN,Yes. He's turning us against each other. You're hallucinating.
216,RUFUS,The Horseman. War.
216,DEAN,Yes.
216,RUFUS,"Did you figure this out all by yourself, genius?"
216,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa!"
216,ELLEN,We all on the same page?
216,RUFUS,Good.
216,DEAN,"Hi, Jo."
216,JO,Hey.
216,DEAN,"Okay, we got to find War before everybody in this town kills each—"
216,DEAN,Damn it! Where's Sam?
216,RUFUS,Upstairs.
216,ELLEN,Take this.
216,AUSTIN,"All right, you three go around back. Take the alley."
216,SAM,Dean. It's not demons.
216,DEAN,I just can't figure out how he's doing it.
216,SAM,The ring.
216,DEAN,The ring. The ring—that's right. He turned it right before he made everybody hallucinate and go hellbitch.
216,SAM,Right.
216,DEAN,We got to move. Come on.
216,RUFUS,"People, cease fire!"
216,RUFUS,Stop shooting! Stop!
216,RUFUS,I'm getting too old for this.
216,ELLEN,"I'm not what you think, honey. Come on, keep this right here."
216,RUFUS,'Stop firing' usually means 'stop firing'.
216,WAR,"Whoa. Okay. That's a sweet little knife. But come on. You can't kill war, kiddos."
216,DEAN,"Oh, we know."
216,DEAN,"So, pit stop at Mount Doom?"
216,SAM,Dean—
216,DEAN,"Sam, let's not."
216,SAM,"No, listen. This is important. I know you don't trust me."
216,SAM,"Just, now I realize something. I don't trust me either."
216,SAM,"From the minute I saw that blood, only thought in my head...and I tell myself it's for the right reasons, my intentions are good, and it, it feels true, you know? But I think, underneath...I just miss the feeling. I know how messed up that sounds, which means I know how messed up I am. Thing is, the problem's not the demon blood, not really. I mean, I, what I did, I can't blame the blood or Ruby or...anything. The problem's me. How far I'll go. There's something in me that...scares the hell out of me, Dean. In the last couple of days, I caught another glimpse..."
216,DEAN,So what are you saying?
216,SAM,"I'm in no shape to be hunting. I need to step back, 'cause I'm dangerous. Maybe it's best we just...go our separate ways."
216,DEAN,"Well, I think you're right."
216,SAM,I was expecting a fight.
216,DEAN,"The truth is I spend more time worrying about you than about doing the job right. And I just, I can't afford that, you know? Not now."
216,SAM,"I'm sorry, Dean."
216,DEAN,"I know you are, Sam."
216,DEAN,"Hey, do you, uh, wanna take the Impala?"
216,SAM,It's okay.
216,SAM,"Take care of yourself, Dean."
216,DEAN,"Yeah, you too, Sammy."
217,SAM,"As if after everything, I haven't learned my lesson."
217,DEAN,"Well, have you?"
217,SAM,"This is my girlfriend, Jessica."
217,SAM,No! Jess!
217,DEAN,I'm a vessel?
217,DEAN,The answer's no.
217,CHUCK,The archangel smote the crap out of him.
217,ZACHARIAH,How are you—
217,CASTIEL,Alive? That's a good question.
217,SAM,I just wish I could save people. Like I used to.
217,DEAN,Like when you were all hopped up on demon blood?
217,CASTIEL,Your plan—
217,CASTIEL,I'm gonna find God.
217,DEAN,Try New Mexico. I hear he's on a tortilla.
217,CASTIEL,"I killed two angels this week. I rebelled, and I did it, all of it, for you, and you failed."
217,SAM,I'm in no shape to be hunting.
217,JESS,"Hey, baby."
217,JESS,I missed you.
217,SAM,Jessica. I'm dreaming.
217,JESS,Or you're not. What's the difference? I'm here.
217,SAM,I miss you so much.
217,JESS,I know.
217,JESS,"I miss you too. What are you doing, Sam?"
217,SAM,What do you mean?
217,JESS,Running away. Haven't we been down this road before?
217,SAM,No. It's different now.
217,JESS,Really?
217,SAM,Last time I wanted to be normal. This time I know I'm a freak.
217,JESS,Which is all a big ball of semantics. You know that.
217,SAM,No.
217,JESS,"Even at Stanford you knew. You knew there was something dark inside of you. Deep down, maybe, but you knew. Maybe that's what got me killed."
217,SAM,No.
217,JESS,I was dead from the moment we said hello.
217,SAM,No.
217,JESS,Don't you get it? You can't run from yourself. Why are you running now?
217,SAM,"Why are you here, Jess?"
217,JESS,Would you believe I'm actually trying to protect you?
217,SAM,From what?
217,JESS,You. Sooner or later the past is going to catch up to you like it always does. You know what happens then?
217,JESS,"People die. Baby, the people closest to you die."
217,SAM,Don't worry because I won't make that mistake again.
217,JESS,"Same song, different verse. Things are never gonna change with you. Ever."
217,SAM,Thanks.
217,DRIVER,You're welcome.
217,DEAN,"Hi, Detective Bill Buckner."
217,DOCTOR,"Yes. How can I help you, Detective?"
217,DEAN,"I'm here about those patients, the exsanguinated ones."
217,DEAN,"Eat it, Twilight."
217,DEAN,God.
217,DEAN,Don't do that.
217,CASTIEL,"Hello, Dean."
217,DEAN,"Cas, we've talked about this. Personal space?"
217,CASTIEL,My apologies.
217,DEAN,How'd you find me? I thought I was flying below the angel radar.
217,CASTIEL,You are. Bobby told me where you were.
217,CASTIEL,Where's Sam?
217,DEAN,Me and Sam are taking separate vacations for a while. So.
217,DEAN,"You find God yet? More importantly, can I have my damn necklace back, please?"
217,CASTIEL,"No, I haven't found him. That's why I'm here. I need your help."
217,DEAN,With what? God hunt? Not interested.
217,CASTIEL,It's not God. It's someone else.
217,DEAN,Who?
217,CASTIEL,Archangel. The one who killed me.
217,DEAN,'Scuse me?
217,CASTIEL,His name is Raphael.
217,DEAN,You were wasted by a teenage mutant ninja angel?
217,CASTIEL,I've heard whispers that he's walking the earth. This is a rare opportunity.
217,DEAN,For what? Revenge?
217,CASTIEL,Information.
217,DEAN,"So, what, you think you can find this dude and he's just gonna spill God's address?"
217,CASTIEL,"Yes, because we are gonna trap him and interrogate him."
217,DEAN,You're serious about this.
217,DEAN,"So, what, I'm Thelma and you're Louise and we're just going to hold hands and sail off this cliff together?"
217,DEAN,Give me one good reason why I should do this.
217,CASTIEL,Because you're Michael's vessel and no angel will dare harm you.
217,DEAN,"Oh, so I'm your bullet shield."
217,CASTIEL,I need your help because you are the only one who'll help me. Please.
217,DEAN,"All right, fine. Where is he?"
217,CASTIEL,Maine. Let's go.
217,DEAN,Whoa.
217,CASTIEL,What?
217,DEAN,Last time you zapped me someplace I didn't poop for a week. We're driving.
217,LINDSEY,"Hey Keith, you play?"
217,SAM,That depends. What are we playing for?
217,LINDSEY,World peace.
217,SAM,"Oh, is that all?"
217,LINDSEY,Can I ask you something?
217,SAM,Shoot.
217,LINDSEY,You finished that crossword puzzle in the kitchen?
217,SAM,"Uh, I guess. Why?"
217,SAM,Was it?
217,LINDSEY,"Uh-huh. You blow into town last week, you don't talk to anybody, you're obviously highly educated. You're like this..."
217,SAM,Riddle wrapped inside an enigma wrapped inside a taco?
217,LINDSEY,"Here's what we play for. When I win, you buy me dinner and tell me your life story."
217,SAM,Sounds fair.
217,LINDSEY,Very mysterioso.
217,LINDSEY,I like it.
217,REPORTER,"—the town of Tully? tonight, John. Locals say that what started as a torrential hailstorm late this afternoon suddenly turned to massive lightning strikes that triggered the fires now consuming more than twenty acres here along the Route 17 corridor. County officials are advising all Tully residents to prepare for what could become mandatory evacuations."
217,BARTENDER,Damn. Is it me or does it seem like it's the end of the world?
217,DEAN,And we're here why?
217,CASTIEL,A deputy sheriff laid eyes on the archangel.
217,DEAN,"And he still has eyes? All right, what's the plan?"
217,CASTIEL,"We'll...tell the officer that he witnessed an angel of the Lord, and the officer will tell us where the angel is."
217,DEAN,Seriously? You're going to walk in there and tell him the truth?
217,CASTIEL,Why not?
217,DEAN,Because we're humans.
217,DEAN,"And when humans want something really, really bad, we lie."
217,CASTIEL,Why?
217,DEAN,Because that's how you become President.
217,DEAN,Deputy Framingham?
217,DEAN,"Hi. Alonzo Mosely, FBI. This is my partner, Eddie Moscone."
217,DEAN,Also FBI.
217,DEAN,"He's, uh, he's new. Mind if we ask you a few questions?"
217,FRAMINGHAM,"Yeah, sure. Talk here, though."
217,FRAMINGHAM,Hearing's all blown to hell in this one.
217,DEAN,That happen recently?
217,FRAMINGHAM,"Yeah. Gas station. Why you're here, isn't it?"
217,DEAN,"Yes, it is."
217,DEAN,"You mind just, uh, running us through what happened?"
217,FRAMINGHAM,A call came in. Disturbance out at the Pump and Go on Route 4.
217,DEAN,What kind of disturbance?
217,FRAMINGHAM,Would not have believed my eyes if I hadn't seen it myself. We're talking a riot. Full scale.
217,DEAN,How many?
217,FRAMINGHAM,"Thirty, forty, in all-out kill-or-be-killed combat?"
217,DEAN,Any idea what set them off?
217,CASTIEL,"It's angels and demons, probably."
217,CASTIEL,They're skirmishing all over the globe.
217,FRAMINGHAM,Come again?
217,FRAMINGHAM,What did he say?
217,DEAN,Nothing. Nothing.
217,CASTIEL,Demons. Demons.
217,DEAN,"Demons, you know, drink, adultery. We all have our demons, Walt."
217,FRAMINGHAM,I guess.
217,DEAN,Anyway.
217,DEAN,What happened next?
217,FRAMINGHAM,"Freaking explosion, that's what. They said it was one of those underground gas tanks, but, uh, I don't think so."
217,DEAN,Why not?
217,FRAMINGHAM,"Wasn't your usual fireball. It was, um—"
217,CASTIEL,Pure white.
217,FRAMINGHAM,"Yeah. Gas station was leveled. Everyone was...it was just horrible. And I see this one guy, kneeling, real focused-like, not a damn scratch on him."
217,DEAN,You know him?
217,FRAMINGHAM,Donnie Finneman. Mechanic there.
217,DEAN,"Let me guess, he just, uh, vanished into thin air?"
217,FRAMINGHAM,"Uh, no, Kolchak. He's down at Saint Pete's."
217,CASTIEL,Saint Pete's.
217,DEAN,Thank you.
217,DEAN,I take it that's not Raphael anymore.
217,CASTIEL,Just an empty vessel.
217,DEAN,So is this what I'm looking at if Michael jumps in my bones?
217,CASTIEL,"No, not at all. Michael is much more powerful. It'll be far worse for you."
217,BOBBY,Sam?
217,SAM,Hey Bobby. How you doing?
217,BOBBY,"Well I ain't running any marathons, but I'll live."
217,BOBBY,Where are you?
217,SAM,"Uh, Garber, Oklahoma. I found a town up the road showing some Revelation omens."
217,BOBBY,What omens?
217,SAM,"All right, listen to this. 'And upon his rising there shall be hail and fire mixed with blood.'"
217,BOBBY,Well ain't that delightful.
217,SAM,Yeah. But we already got hailstorms and fire so I'm guessing blood can't be too far behind.
217,BOBBY,Okay.
217,SAM,What?
217,BOBBY,There a reason you're calling?
217,SAM,Dean didn't tell you?
217,BOBBY,He told me.
217,SAM,Yeah. So I just thought you might want to find out who's in the area and put a man on this.
217,BOBBY,"Okay, let me see if I can think of the best hunter who might be in the immediate vicinity—oh, that'd be you."
217,SAM,"I can't, Bobby, I'm sitting this one out."
217,BOBBY,Sam—
217,SAM,I gotta go. I'm so sorry.
217,BOBBY,"Hold on, Sam—"
217,DEAN,Where've you been?
217,CASTIEL,Jerusalem.
217,DEAN,"Oh, how was it?"
217,CASTIEL,Arid.
217,DEAN,What's that?
217,CASTIEL,It's oil. It's very special. Very rare.
217,DEAN,"Okay, so we trap Raphael with a nice vinaigrette?"
217,CASTIEL,No.
217,DEAN,"So this ritual of yours, when does it got to go down?"
217,CASTIEL,Sunrise.
217,DEAN,Tell me something. You keep saying we're gonna trap this guy. Isn't that kinda like trapping a hurricane with a butterfly net?
217,CASTIEL,"No, it's harder."
217,DEAN,Do we have any chance of surviving this?
217,CASTIEL,You do.
217,DEAN,So odds are you're a dead man tomorrow.
217,CASTIEL,Yes.
217,DEAN,Well. Last night on earth. What are your plans?
217,CASTIEL,I just thought I'd sit here quietly.
217,DEAN,"Come on, anything? Booze, women?"
217,DEAN,"You have been with women before. Right? Or an angel, at least?"
217,DEAN,You mean to tell me you've never been up there doing a little cloud-seeding?
217,CASTIEL,"Look, I've never had occasion, okay?"
217,DEAN,All right.
217,MAN,"Hey, Sam."
217,MAN,Sam.
217,LINDSEY,Sam? What happened to Keith?
217,SAM,"Wait, what?"
217,LINDSEY,He called you Sam.
217,SAM,Yeah. Uh. Sam's my middle name.
217,LINDSEY,"Keith Sam? Man, I'm sorry."
217,TIM,"Well, actually, it's Samuel, so it's not quite as dumb as it sounds."
217,LINDSEY,Are you guys friends?
217,STEVE,Hunting buddies. With his dad. Samuel here is quite the hunter himself.
217,LINDSEY,Wow. You killed deer and things?
217,TIM,"Yeah, and things."
217,SAM,Um. Why don't I get you guys some drinks?
217,TIM,Sorry. Didn't mean to bust you back there.
217,SAM,No. It's all right. So what's up?
217,TIM,Bobby called.
217,SAM,And?
217,TIM,You were right. Major demon block party going on.
217,SAM,But why? What are they up to?
217,STEVE,Don't know yet.
217,REGGIE,Bobby told us you were off limits. That true?
217,SAM,"Yeah, that's right."
217,TIM,"That's fine in theory and all, but we could really use all hands on deck here."
217,SAM,I know you could. But I can't. I'm sorry.
217,STEVE,Why not?
217,SAM,It's personal.
217,TIM,"Look, man, what baggage is so heavy it can't be stowed away for the freaking apocalypse?"
217,SAM,Like I said—
217,REGGIE,Yeah. You're sorry. Heard it the first time.
217,TIM,"Suit yourself. More for us then, right?"
217,SAM,Good luck.
217,TIM,But hey. Beers are on you when we get back.
217,SAM,"Yeah, you bet."
217,LINDSEY,So your parents were drunk when they named you and you shoot Bambi?
217,SAM,It's a long story.
217,LINDSEY,That is it. Enough with the kung fu wandering the earth thing. I'm gonna buy you dinner and we're gonna talk.
217,SAM,"Lindsey, I can't."
217,LINDSEY,No. The only way to avoid bloodshed is to say yes.
217,DEAN,Hey. Relax.
217,CASTIEL,This is a den of iniquity. I should not be here.
217,DEAN,"Dude, you full-on rebelled against heaven. Iniquity is one of the perks."
217,DEAN,Showtime.
217,HOOKER,Hi. What's your name?
217,DEAN,Cas.
217,DEAN,His name is Cas. What's your name?
217,HOOKER,Chastity.
217,DEAN,Chastity.
217,DEAN,"Wow. Is that kismet or what, buddy? Well, he likes you, you like him, so dayenu."
217,CHASTITY,"Come on, baby."
217,DEAN,"Hey, listen. Take this."
217,DEAN,"If she asks for a credit card, no. Now just stick to the basics, okay? Do not order off the menu. Go get her, tiger."
217,DEAN,Don't make me push you.
217,DEAN,"Well, cheers to you."
217,CHASTITY,"Get out of my face! Leave me alone! Bastard! Screw you, jerk!"
217,CHASTITY,I'll kill you!
217,CHASTITY,Screw you too! God! Oh! Jerk!
217,DEAN,The hell did you do?
217,CASTIEL,I don't know. I just looked her in the eyes and told her it wasn't her fault that her father Gene ran off. It was because he hated his job at the post office.
217,DEAN,"Oh, no, man."
217,CASTIEL,What?
217,DEAN,"This whole industry runs on absent fathers. It's, it's the natural order."
217,DEAN,We should go. Come on.
217,CASTIEL,What's so funny?
217,DEAN,"Oh, nothing. Whoo. It's been a long time since I've laughed that hard. It's been more than a long time. Years."
217,LINDSEY,So...you gonna tell me who those guys back there really were? And don't say hunting buddies.
217,SAM,Okay. Um. We used to be in the same business together.
217,LINDSEY,What business?
217,SAM,How's your salad?
217,LINDSEY,"Witness protection, right? You're Mafia?"
217,SAM,I'm not Mafia.
217,LINDSEY,"Okay, I get it. Don't mean to pry, my bad."
217,SAM,"I used to be in business with my brother. Truth is I was pretty good at the job. But...I made some mistakes, I did some stuff I'm not so proud of, and people got hurt. A lot of people."
217,LINDSEY,What was your poison?
217,SAM,Sorry?
217,LINDSEY,"Come on. You were hooked on something, I know the look."
217,LINDSEY,Three years sober.
217,SAM,You work in a bar.
217,LINDSEY,"So do you. Look, Keith. I don't know you and I'm the last person to be giving advice, but I do know that no one has ever done anything so bad that they can't be forgiven. That they can't change."
217,CASTIEL,"When the oil burns, no angel can touch or pass through the flames, or he dies."
217,DEAN,"Okay, so we trap him in a steel cage of holy fire, but one question. How the hell do we get him here?"
217,CASTIEL,"Very simple. There's, well, almost an open phone line between a vessel and his angel. One just has to know how to dial."
217,CASTIEL,"I'm here, Raphael. Come and get me, you little bastard."
217,DEAN,"Just out of curiosity, what is the average customer wait time to speak to an archangel?"
217,CASTIEL,Be ready.
217,DEAN,Well that's a day I'll never get back.
217,CASTIEL,"Dean, wait."
217,RAPHAEL,Castiel.
217,CASTIEL,Raphael.
217,DEAN,And I thought you were supposed to be impressive. All you do is black out the room.
217,RAPHAEL,And the Eastern Seaboard.
217,RAPHAEL,It is a testament to my unending mercy that I do not smite you here and now.
217,DEAN,"Or maybe you're full of crap. Maybe you're afraid God will bring Cas back to life again and smite you and your candy-ass skirt. By the way, hi, I'm Dean."
217,RAPHAEL,"I know who you are. And now, thanks to him, I know where you are."
217,CASTIEL,You won't kill him. You wouldn't dare.
217,RAPHAEL,But I will take him to Michael.
217,DEAN,"Well then. Sounds terrifying. It does. But, uh, hate to tell you, I'm not going anywhere with you."
217,RAPHAEL,Surely you remember Zachariah giving you stomach cancer?
217,DEAN,"Yeah, that was, that was hilarious."
217,RAPHAEL,"Well, he doesn't have anything close to my imagination."
217,DEAN,Yeah? I bet you didn't imagine one thing.
217,RAPHAEL,What?
217,DEAN,"We knew you were coming, you stupid son of a bitch."
217,DEAN,"Don't look at me, it was his idea."
217,CASTIEL,Where is He?
217,RAPHAEL,"God? Didn't you hear? He's dead, Castiel. Dead."
217,SAM,Bar's closed.
217,SAM,Hey.
217,TIM,"Something you want to tell me, Sam?"
217,SAM,What? No.
217,TIM,You sure about that?
217,SAM,I—I don't know—jeez. Are you okay? Where are Reggie and Steve?
217,TIM,"Oh, Steve's good, he's, uh, his guts are lying roadside outside the Hawley Five and Dime."
217,SAM,I'm sorry.
217,TIM,"Sorry don't cut it, Sam."
217,SAM,What do you want me to say?
217,TIM,The truth.
217,TIM,"Okay, fine. Let me give you some of my own, then. We go into town, we catch ourselves a demon, we get jumped by ten more. Steve bought it."
217,SAM,I'm sorry.
217,TIM,"Saying it twice don't make it so, Sam. You see, this demon, he, uh, he told us things. Crazy things, things about you, Sam."
217,SAM,Demons lie.
217,TIM,Yeah. I'm gonna ask you one last time. The truth. Now.
217,SAM,Lindsey!
217,LINDSEY,What's going on?
217,RAPHAEL,But there's no other explanation. He's gone for good.
217,CASTIEL,You're lying.
217,RAPHAEL,Am I? Do you remember the twentieth century? Think the twenty-first is going any better? Do you think God would have let any of that happen if He were alive?
217,DEAN,Oh yeah? Well then who invented the Chinese basket trick?
217,RAPHAEL,"Careful. That's my Father you're talking about, boy."
217,DEAN,"Yeah, who would be so proud to know His sons started the frigging apocalypse."
217,RAPHAEL,Who ran off and disappeared. Who left no instructions and a world to run.
217,DEAN,"Daddy ran away and disappeared. He didn't happen to work for the post office, did He?"
217,RAPHAEL,This is funny to you? You're living in a godless universe.
217,DEAN,"And? What, you and the other kids just decided to throw an apocalypse while He was gone?"
217,RAPHAEL,We're tired. We just want it to be over. We just want...paradise.
217,DEAN,"So, what, God dies and makes you the boss and you decide you can do whatever you want?"
217,RAPHAEL,"Yes. And whatever we want, we get."
217,SAM,"Just take it easy, okay? Put the knife down."
217,SAM,"It's true. What the demons said, it's all true."
217,TIM,Keep going.
217,SAM,Why? You gonna hate me any less? Am I gonna hate myself any less? What do you want?
217,TIM,I want to hear you say it.
217,SAM,I did it. I started the apocalypse.
217,CASTIEL,"If God is dead, why have I returned? Who brought me back?"
217,RAPHAEL,Did it ever occur to you that maybe Lucifer raised you?
217,CASTIEL,No.
217,RAPHAEL,Think about it. He needs all the rebellious angels he can find. You know it adds up.
217,CASTIEL,Let's go.
217,RAPHAEL,"Castiel, I'm warning you. Do not leave me here. I will find you."
217,CASTIEL,"Maybe one day. But today, you're my little bitch."
217,DEAN,What he said.
217,SAM,What is that?
217,TIM,"What do you think it is? It's go juice, Sammy boy."
217,SAM,Get that away from me.
217,TIM,"Away from you? No. This is for you. Hell if that demon wasn't right as rain. Down the hatch, son."
217,SAM,You're insane.
217,TIM,"Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna drink this, Hulk out, and you're gonna waste every one of the demon scum that killed my best friend."
217,TIM,Or she dies.
217,SAM,You wouldn't do that.
217,TIM,It's funny how watching your best friend die changes that.
217,TIM,"Come on, you know you want it, Sam. Just reach out and take it."
217,TIM,"There, was that really so bad?"
217,SAM,Go.
217,TIM,Don't think we won't be back.
217,SAM,Don't think I won't be here.
217,DEAN,You okay?
217,DEAN,"Look, I'll be the first to tell you that this little crusade of yours is nuts, but I do know a little something about missing fathers."
217,CASTIEL,What do you mean?
217,DEAN,"I mean there were times when I was looking for my dad when all logic said that he was dead, but I knew in my heart he was still alive. Who cares what some ninja turtle says, Cas, what do you believe?"
217,CASTIEL,I believe he's out there.
217,DEAN,Good. Then go find him.
217,CASTIEL,What about you?
217,DEAN,"What about me? I don't know. Honestly, I'm good. I can't believe I'm saying that, but I am, I'm really good."
217,CASTIEL,Even without your brother?
217,DEAN,"Especially without my brother. I mean, I spent so much time worrying about the son of a bitch. I mean, I've had more fun with you in the past twenty-four hours than I've had with Sam in years, and you're not that much fun. It's funny, you know, I've been so chained to my family, but now that I'm alone, hell, I'm happy."
217,JESS,Sam. Sam.
217,JESS,So. This is your life now? Think you can just live forever with your head buried in the sand?
217,SAM,"I love you, Jess."
217,SAM,"God knows how much I miss you, too. But you're wrong. People can change. There is reason for hope."
217,JESS,"No, Sam. There isn't."
217,SAM,How can you be so sure?
217,LUCIFER,Because you freed me.
217,LUCIFER,That's right. You know who I am.
217,SAM,Lucifer.
217,LUCIFER,"You are a hard one to find, Sam. Harder than most humans. I don't suppose you'd tell me where you are?"
217,SAM,What do you want with me?
217,LUCIFER,"Thanks to you, I walk the earth. I want to give you a gift. I want to give you everything."
217,SAM,I don't want anything from you.
217,LUCIFER,"I'm so sorry, Sam, I, I really am, but Nick here is just an improvisation. Plan B. He can barely contain me without spontaneously combusting."
217,SAM,What are you talking about?
217,LUCIFER,"Why do you think you were in that chapel? You're the one, Sam. You're my vessel. My true vessel."
217,SAM,No.
217,LUCIFER,Yes.
217,SAM,No. That'll never happen.
217,LUCIFER,"I'm sorry, but it will. I will find you. And when I do, you will let me in. I'm sure of it."
217,SAM,You need my consent.
217,LUCIFER,Of course. I'm an angel.
217,SAM,I will kill myself before letting you in.
217,LUCIFER,I'll just bring you back.
217,LUCIFER,"Sam. My heart breaks for you. The weight on your shoulders, what you've done, what you still have to do. It is more than anyone could bear. If there was some other way...but there isn't. I will never lie to you. I will never trick you. But you will say yes to me."
217,SAM,You're wrong.
217,LUCIFER,I'm not. I think I know you better than you know yourself.
217,SAM,Why me?
217,LUCIFER,"Because it had to be you, Sam. It always had to be you."
218,DEAN,Something turned him into a monster.
218,SAM,More like demonic germ warfare.
218,DEAN,I'm a vessel?
218,DEAN,You need my consent.
218,DEAN,—to ride around in my skin.
218,ZACHARIAH,"Unfortunately, yes."
218,DEAN,The answer's no.
218,LUCIFER,You know who I am.
218,SAM,Lucifer.
218,LUCIFER,"You're the one, Sam. You're my vessel."
218,SAM,That'll never happen.
218,SAM,I know you don't trust me.
218,DEAN,So what are you saying?
218,SAM,I'm dangerous.
218,DEAN,"Too friggin' much, pal."
218,CASTIEL,We are.
218,DEAN,"Well, that doesn't make any sense. I mean, why would the demons keep a gun around that, uh, kills demons?"
218,CASTIEL,What? What? Did—I didn't—I didn't get that.
218,DEAN,"You know, it's kind of funny. Talking to a messenger of God on a cellphone. It's, you know, like watching a Hell's Angel ride a moped."
218,CASTIEL,"This isn't funny, Dean. The voice says I'm almost out of minutes."
218,DEAN,"Okay, all right. I'm—I'm telling you, Cas, the mooks have melted down the gun by now."
218,CASTIEL,"Well, I hear differently. And if it's true and if you are still set on the insane task of killing the devil, this is how we do it."
218,DEAN,Okay. Where do we start?
218,CASTIEL,Where are you now?
218,DEAN,Kansas City.
218,DEAN,"Century Hotel, room 113."
218,CASTIEL,I'll be there immediately.
218,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, come on, man. I just drove like sixteen hours straight, okay? I'm human. And there's stuff I got to do."
218,CASTIEL,What stuff?
218,DEAN,"Eat, for example. In this case, sleep. I just need like four hours once in a while, okay?"
218,CASTIEL,Yes.
218,DEAN,"Okay, so, you can pop in tomorrow morning."
218,CASTIEL,Yes. I'll just—
218,CASTIEL,"—wait here, then."
218,DEAN,"Damn it, Cas, I need to sleep!"
218,SAM,"Dean, it's me."
218,DEAN,Sam? It's quarter past four.
218,SAM,This is important.
218,DEAN,"So, you're his vessel, huh? Lucifer's wearing you to the prom?"
218,SAM,That's what he said.
218,DEAN,"Just when you thought you were out, they pull you back in, huh, Sammy?"
218,SAM,"So, that's it? That's your response?"
218,DEAN,What are you looking for?
218,SAM,I don't know. A—a little panic? Maybe?
218,DEAN,I guess I'm a little numb to the earth-shattering revelations at this point.
218,SAM,What are we gonna do about it?
218,DEAN,What do you want to do about it?
218,SAM,"I want back in, for starters."
218,DEAN,Sam—
218,SAM,"I mean it. I am sick of being a puppet to these sons of bitches. I'm gonna hunt him down, Dean."
218,DEAN,"Oh, so, we're back to revenge, then, are we? Yeah, 'cause that worked out so well last time."
218,SAM,Not revenge. Redemption.
218,DEAN,"So, what, you're just gonna walk back in and we're gonna be the dynamic duo again?"
218,SAM,"Look, Dean, I can do this. I can. I'm gonna prove it to you."
218,DEAN,"Look, Sam—it doesn't matter—whatever we do. I mean, it turns out that you and me, we're the, uh, the fire and the oil of the Armageddon. You know, on that basis alone, we should just pick a hemisphere. Stay away from each other for good."
218,SAM,"Dean, it does not have to be like this. We can fight it."
218,DEAN,"Yeah, you're right. We can. But not together. We're not stronger when we're together, Sam. I think we're weaker. Because whatever we have between us—love, family, whatever it is—they are always gonna use it against us. And you know that. Yeah, we're better off apart. We got a better chance of dodging Lucifer and Michael and this whole damn thing, if we just go our own ways."
218,SAM,"Dean, don't do this."
218,DEAN,"Bye, Sam."
218,DEAN,Little girl? Little girl?
218,DEAN,Are you hurt?
218,DEAN,"You know the not-talking thing is kind of creepy, right?"
218,DEAN,"Oh, crap."
218,DEAN,"August first, 2014."
218,DEAN,That's never a good sign.
218,ZACHARIAH,"""Croatoan pandemic reaches Australia."""
218,ZACHARIAH,"""President Palin defends bombing of Houston."" Certainly a buyer's market in real estate. Let's see what's happening in sports. That's right—no more sports. Congress revoked the right to group assembly. What's left of Congress, that is. Hardly a quorum, if you ask me."
218,DEAN,How did you find me?
218,ZACHARIAH,"Afraid we had to tap some unorthodox resources of late—human informants. We've been making inspirational visits to the fringier Christian groups. They've been given your image, told to keep an eye out."
218,DEAN,"The Bible freak outside the motel—he, what, dropped a dime on me?"
218,ZACHARIAH,"Onward, Christian soldiers."
218,DEAN,"Okay, well, good, great. You have had your jollies. Now send me back, you son of a bitch."
218,ZACHARIAH,"Oh, you'll get back—all in good time. We want you to marinate a bit."
218,DEAN,Marinate?
218,ZACHARIAH,"Three days, Dean. Three days to see where this course of action takes you."
218,DEAN,What's that supposed to mean?
218,ZACHARIAH,"It means that your choices have consequences. This is what happens to the world if you continue to say ""no"" to Michael. Have a little look-see."
218,DEAN,"Bobby? Bobby, I'm coming in!"
218,DEAN,"Oh, no."
218,DEAN,"Where is everybody, Bobby?"
218,DEAN,Camp Chitaqua.
218,DEAN,"Oh, baby, no."
218,DEAN,"Oh, no, baby, what did they do to you?"
218,DEAN,What the hell?
218,2014!DEAN,"I should be asking that question, don't you think? In fact, why don't you give me one good reason why I shouldn't gank you right here and now?"
218,DEAN,Because you'd only be hurting yourself.
218,2014!DEAN,Very funny.
218,DEAN,"Look, man—I'm no shapeshifter or demon or anything, okay?"
218,2014!DEAN,"Yeah, I know. I did the drill while you were out. Silver, salt, holy water—nothing. But you know what was funny? Was that you had every hidden lockpick, box cutter, and switchblade that I carry. Now, you want to explain that? Oh, and the, uh, resemblance, while you're at it?"
218,Dean,Zachariah.
218,2014!DEAN,Come again?
218,Dean,I'm you from the tail end of 2009. Zach plucked me from my bed and threw me five years into the future.
218,2014!DEAN,Where is he? I want to talk to him.
218,Dean,I don't know.
218,2014!DEAN,"Oh, you don't know."
218,DEAN,"No, I don't know. Look, I just want to get back to my own friggin' year, okay?"
218,2014!DEAN,"Okay. If you're me, then tell me something only I would know."
218,DEAN,"Rhonda Hurley. We were, uh, nineteen. She made us try on her panties. They were pink. And satiny. And you know what? We kind of liked it."
218,2014!DEAN,"Touché. So, what, Zach zapped you up here to see how bad it gets?"
218,DEAN,"I guess. Croatoan virus, right? That's their endgame?"
218,2014!DEAN,"It's efficient, it's incurable, and it's scary as hell. Turns people into monsters. Started hitting the major cities about two years ago. World really went in the crapper after that."
218,DEAN,What about Sam?
218,2014!DEAN,"Heavyweight showdown in Detroit. From what I understand, Sam didn't make it."
218,DEAN,You weren't with him?
218,2014!DEAN,"No. No, me and Sam, we haven't talked in—hell, five years."
218,DEAN,We never tried to find him?
218,2014!DEAN,We had other people to worry about.
218,DEAN,Where you going?
218,2014!DEAN,I got to run an errand.
218,DEAN,Whoa. You're just gonna leave me here?
218,DEAN,"Okay. All right. Fine. But you don't have to cuff me, man. Oh, come on. You don't trust yourself?"
218,2014!DEAN,No. Absolutely not.
218,DEAN,Dick.
218,CHUCK,"Hey, Dean. You got a second?"
218,DEAN,"No—yes. Uh, I—I guess. Hi, Chuck."
218,CHUCK,"Hi. So, uh, listen, we're pretty good on canned goods for now, but we're down to next to nothing on perishables and—and hygiene supplies. People are not gonna be happy about this. So, what do you think we should do?"
218,DEAN,"I—I don't know. Maybe, uh, share? You know, like at a kibbutz."
218,CHUCK,Wait a minute. aren't you supposed to be out on a mission right now?
218,Dean,Absolutely. And I will be.
218,CHUCK,Uh-oh.
218,DEAN,"Whoa! Jeez! Easy, lady!"
218,CHUCK,Risa.
218,DEAN,Risa?
218,RISA,"You spent the night in Jane's cabin last night, didn't you?"
218,DEAN,"Uh, what? I—I don't—did I?"
218,RISA,I thought we had a 'connection'.
218,DEAN,"Well, I'm sure that we do."
218,RISA,Yeah?
218,CHUCK,"Hi, Risa."
218,RISA,Screw you.
218,DEAN,"Oh, jeez. I'm getting busted for stuff I haven't even done yet."
218,CHUCK,What?
218,DEAN,"Uh, never mind. Hey, Chuck, is...Cas still here?"
218,CHUCK,Yeah. I don't think Cas is going anywhere.
218,2014!CASTIEL,"So, in this way. We're each a fragment of total perception—just, uh, one compartment in that dragonfly eye of group mind. Now, the key to this total, shared perception—it's, um, it's surprisingly physical."
218,2014!CASTIEL,"Oh. Excuse me, ladies. I think I need to confer with our fearless leader for a minute. Why not go get washed up for the orgy?"
218,2014!CASTIEL,You're all so beautiful.
218,DEAN,"What are you, a hippie?"
218,2014!CASTIEL,I thought you'd gotten over trying to label me.
218,DEAN,"Cas, we got to talk."
218,2014!CASTIEL,Whoa. Strange.
218,DEAN,What?
218,2014!CASTIEL,"You...are not you. Not now you, anyway."
218,DEAN,"No! Yeah. Yes, exactly."
218,2014!CASTIEL,What year are you from?
218,DEAN,2009.
218,2014!CASTIEL,Who did this to you? Is it Zachariah?
218,DEAN,Yes.
218,2014!CASTIEL,Interesting.
218,DEAN,"Oh, yeah, it's friggin' fascinating. Now. Why don't you strap on your angel wings and fly me back to my page on the calendar?"
218,2014!CASTIEL,"I wish I could just, uh, strap on my wings, but I'm sorry, no dice."
218,DEAN,"What, are you stoned?"
218,2014!CASTIEL,"Uh, generally, yeah."
218,DEAN,What happened to you?
218,2014!CASTIEL,Life.
218,DEAN,Hey. Hey! Watch out!
218,2014!DEAN,Damn it.
218,2014!DEAN,"I'm not gonna lie to you. Me and him—It's a pretty messed-up situation we got going. But believe me, when you need to know something, you will know it. Until then, we all have work to do."
218,2014!DEAN,What the hell was that?
218,DEAN,What the hell was that? You just shot a guy in cold blood.
218,2014!DEAN,We were in an open quarantine zone. Got ambushed by some Croats on the way out.
218,2014!DEAN,Croats. Croatoans. One of them infected Yeager.
218,DEAN,How do you know?
218,2014!DEAN,"'Cause after a few years of this, I know. I started seeing symptoms about a half an hour ago. Wasn't gonna be long before he flipped. I didn't see the point in troubling a good man with bad news."
218,DEAN,'Troubling a good man'? You just blew him away in front of your own people. Don't you think that freaked them out a little bit?
218,2014!DEAN,"It's 2014. Plugging some Croat, it's called commonplace. Trading words with my friggin' clone—that might have freaked them out a little."
218,DEAN,"All right, look—"
218,2014!DEAN,"No, you look. This isn't your time. It's mine. You don't make the decisions. I do. So, when I say stay in, you stay in."
218,DEAN,"All right, man. I'm sorry. Look, I—I'm not trying to mess you—me—us up here."
218,2014!DEAN,I know.
218,DEAN,It's just been a really wacky weekend.
218,2014!DEAN,Tell me about it.
218,DEAN,"What was the mission, anyway?"
218,DEAN,The Colt?
218,2014!DEAN,The Colt.
218,DEAN,Where was it?
218,2014!DEAN,"Everywhere. They've been moving it around. Took me five years, but...I finally got it. And tonight—tonight, I'm gonna kill the devil."
218,RISA,"So, that's it? That's the Colt?"
218,2014!DEAN,"If anything can kill Lucifer, this is it."
218,2014!DEAN,Are you okay?
218,DEAN,"Oh, we were in, uh, Jane's cabin last night. And, apparently, we and...Risa have a connection."
218,2014!DEAN,You want to shut up?
218,2014!DEAN,"We don't have to find Lucifer. We know where he is. The demon that we caught last week, he was one of the big guy's entourage. He knew."
218,RISA,"So, a demon tells you where Satan's gonna be, and you just believe it?"
218,2014!DEAN,"Oh, trust me, he wasn't lying."
218,RISA,And you know this how?
218,2014!CASTIEL,"Our fearless leader, I'm afraid, is all too well schooled in the art of getting to the truth."
218,DEAN,"Torture? Oh, so, we're—we're torturing again."
218,DEAN,"No, that's—that's good. Classy."
218,2014!CASTIEL,What? I like past you.
218,2014!DEAN,Lucifer is here. Now. I know the block and I know the building.
218,2014!CASTIEL,"Oh, good—it's right in the middle of a hot zone."
218,2014!DEAN,"Crawling with Croats, yeah. You saying my plan is reckless?"
218,2014!CASTIEL,"Are you saying we, uh, walk in straight up the driveway, past all the demons and the Croats, and we shoot the devil?"
218,2014!DEAN,Yes.
218,2014!CASTIEL,"Okay, if you don't like, uh, 'reckless', I could use 'insouciant', maybe."
218,2014!DEAN,Are you coming?
218,2014!CASTIEL,"Of course. But why is he? I mean, he's you five years ago. If something happens to him, you're gone, right?"
218,2014!DEAN,He's coming.
218,2014!CASTIEL,"Okay. Well, uh. I'll get the grunts moving."
218,2014!DEAN,We're loaded and on the road by midnight.
218,2014!CASTIEL,All righty.
218,DEAN,Why are you taking me?
218,2014!DEAN,"Relax. You'll be fine. Zach's looking after you, right?"
218,DEAN,"No, that's not what I mean. I want to know what's going on."
218,2014!DEAN,"Yeah, okay. You're coming because I want you to see something. I want you to see our brother."
218,DEAN,Sam? I thought he was dead.
218,2014!DEAN:,Sam didn't die in Detroit. He said 'yes'.
218,DEAN,'Yes'?
218,DEAN,Wait. You mean—
218,2014!DEAN,That's right. The big 'yes'. To the devil. Lucifer's wearing him to the prom.
218,DEAN,Why would he do that?
218,2014!DEAN,"Wish I knew. But now we don't have a choice. It's in him, and it's not getting out. And we've got to kill him, Dean. And you need to see it—the whole damn thing, how bad it gets—so you can do it different."
218,DEAN,What do you mean?
218,2014!DEAN,"Zach said he was gonna bring you back, right? To oh-nine?"
218,DEAN,Yeah.
218,2014!DEAN,"Well, when you get back home—you say 'yes'. You hear me? Say 'yes' to Michael."
218,DEAN,"That's crazy. If I let him in, then Michael fights the devil. The battle's gonna torch half the planet."
218,2014!DEAN,"Look around you, man. Half the planet's better than no planet, which is what we have now. If I could do it over again, I'd say 'yes' in a heartbeat."
218,DEAN,So why don't you?
218,2014!DEAN,"I've tried! I've shouted 'yes' till I was blue in the face! The angels aren't listening! They just—left—gave up! It's too late for me, but for you—"
218,DEAN,"Oh, no. There's got to be another way."
218,2014!DEAN,"Yeah, that's what I thought. I was cocky. Never actually thought I'd lose. But I was wrong. Dean. I was wrong. I'm begging you. Say yes."
218,2014!DEAN,"But you won't. 'Cause I didn't. Because that's just not us, is it?"
218,CHUCK,"So, you're really from oh-nine?"
218,DEAN,"Yeah, afraid so."
218,CHUCK,"Some free advice? You ever get back there, you hoard toilet paper. You understand me? Hoard it. Hoard it like it's made of gold. 'Cause it is."
218,DEAN,"Thank you, Chuck."
218,CHUCK,"Oh, you'll thank me, all right. Mark my words."
218,DEAN,I'll see you around.
218,CHUCK,Yeah. Okay.
218,DEAN,Let me see those.
218,2014!CASTIEL,You want some?
218,DEAN,Amphetamines?
218,2014!CASTIEL,It's the perfect antidote to that absinthe.
218,DEAN,"Mmm. Don't get me wrong, Cas. I, uh. I'm happy that the stick is out of your ass, but—what's going on—w-with the drugs and the orgies and the love-guru crap?"
218,DEAN,What's so funny?
218,2014!CASTIEL,"Dean, I'm not an angel anymore."
218,DEAN,What?
218,2014!CASTIEL,"Yeah, I went mortal."
218,DEAN,What do you mean? How?
218,2014!CASTIEL,"I think it had something to do with the other angels leaving. But when they bailed, my mojo just kind of— psshhew!—drained away. And now, you know, I'm practically human. I mean, Dean, I'm all but useless. Last year, broke my foot, laid up for two months."
218,DEAN,Wow.
218,2014!CASTIEL,Yeah.
218,DEAN,"So, you're human. Well, welcome to the club."
218,2014!CASTIEL,"Thanks. Except I used to belong to a much better club. And now I'm powerless. I'm hapless, I'm hopeless. I mean, why the hell not bury myself in women and decadence, right? It's the end, baby. That's what decadence is for. Why not bang a few gongs before the lights go out? But then that's, that's just how I roll."
218,2014!DEAN,There. Second-floor window. We go in there.
218,RISA,You sure about this?
218,2014!DEAN,"They'll never see us coming. Trust me. Now, weapons check. We're on the move in five."
218,DEAN,"Hey, uh, me. Can I talk to you for a sec?"
218,DEAN,Tell me what's going on.
218,2014!DEAN,What?
218,DEAN,I know you. You're lying to these people and to me.
218,2014!DEAN,Is that so.
218,DEAN,"Yeah. See, I know your lying expressions. I've seen them in the mirror. Now, there's something you're not telling us."
218,2014!DEAN,I don't know what you're talking about.
218,DEAN,"Oh, really? Well, I don't seem to be the only member of your posse with some questions, so, uh, maybe I'll just take my doubts over to them."
218,2014!DEAN,"Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait."
218,DEAN,What?
218,2014!DEAN,"Take a look around you, man. This place should be white-hot with Croats. Where are they?"
218,DEAN,They cleared a path for us. Which means that this is—
218,2014!DEAN,A trap. Exactly.
218,DEAN,"Well, then we can't go through the front."
218,2014!DEAN,"Oh, we're not. They are. They're the decoys. You and me, we're going in through the back."
218,DEAN,"You mean you're gonna feed your friends into a meat grinder? Cas, too? You want to use their deaths as a diversion?"
218,DEAN,"Oh, man, something is broken in you. You're making decisions that I would never make. I wouldn't sacrifice my friends."
218,2014!DEAN,"You're right. You wouldn't. It's one of the main reasons we're in this mess, actually."
218,DEAN,These people count on you. They trust you.
218,2014!DEAN,They trust me to kill the devil and to save the world and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
218,DEAN,"No. Not like this, you're not. I'm not gonna let you."
218,2014!DEAN,"Oh, really?"
218,DEAN,Yeah.
218,LUCIFER,"Oh. Hello, Dean."
218,LUCIFER,Aren't you a surprise.
218,LUCIFER,"You've come a long way to see this, haven't you?"
218,DEAN,"Well, go ahead. Kill me."
218,LUCIFER,Kill you?
218,LUCIFER,Don't you think that would be a little...redundant?
218,LUCIFER,"I'm sorry. It must be painful, speaking to me in this—shape. But it had to be your brother. It had to be."
218,LUCIFER,"You don't have to be afraid of me, Dean. What do you think I'm going to do?"
218,DEAN,I don't know. Maybe deep-fry the planet?
218,LUCIFER,Why? Why would I want to destroy this stunning thing? Beautiful in a trillion different ways. The last perfect handiwork of God.
218,LUCIFER,You ever hear the story of how I fell from grace?
218,DEAN,"Oh, good God, you're not gonna tell me a bedtime story, are you? My stomach's almost out of bile."
218,LUCIFER,You know why God cast me down? Because I loved him. More than anything. And then God created...
218,LUCIFER,"You. The little...hairless apes. And then he asked all of us to bow down before you—to love you, more than him. And I said, ""Father, I can't."" I said, ""These human beings are flawed, murderous."" And for that, God had Michael cast me into hell. Now, tell me, does the punishment fit the crime? Especially, when I was right? Look at what six billion of you have done to this thing, and how many of you blame me for it."
218,DEAN,"You're not fooling me, you know that? With this sympathy-for-the-devil crap. I know what you are."
218,LUCIFER,What am I?
218,DEAN,"You're the same thing, only bigger. The same brand of cockroach I've been squashing my whole life. An ugly, evil, belly-to-the-ground, supernatural piece of crap. The only difference between them and you is the size of your ego."
218,LUCIFER,"I like you, Dean. I get what the other angels see in you. Goodbye. We'll meet again soon."
218,DEAN,You better kill me now!
218,LUCIFER,Pardon?
218,DEAN,"You better kill me now. Or I swear, I will find a way to kill you. And I won't stop."
218,LUCIFER,"I know you won't. I know you won't say yes to Michael, either. And I know you won't kill Sam. Whatever you do, you will always end up here. Whatever choices you make, whatever details you alter, we will always end up—here. I win. So, I win."
218,DEAN,You're wrong.
218,LUCIFER,"See you in five years, Dean."
218,DEAN,"Oh, well, if it isn't the ghost of Christmas screw you."
218,ZACHARIAH,"Enough. Dean, enough. You saw it, right? You saw what happens. You're the only person who can prove the devil wrong. Just say yes."
218,DEAN,How do I know that this whole thing isn't one of your tricks? Huh? Some angel hocus-pocus?
218,ZACHARIAH,The time for tricks is over. Give yourself to Michael. Say yes and we can strike. Before Lucifer gets to Sam. Before billions die.
218,DEAN,Nah.
218,ZACHARIAH,'Nah'? You telling me you haven't learned your lesson?
218,DEAN,"Oh, I've learned a lesson, all right. Just not the one you wanted to teach."
218,ZACHARIAH,"Well, I'll just have to teach it again! Because I got you now, boy, and I'm never letting you—"
218,ZACHARIAH,Son of a...
218,DEAN,"That's pretty nice timing, Cas."
218,CASTIEL,We had an appointment.
218,DEAN,Don't ever change.
218,CASTIEL,How did Zachariah find you?
218,DEAN,"Long story. Let's just stay away from Jehovah's Witnesses from now on, okay?"
218,CASTIEL,What are you doing?
218,DEAN,Something I should have done in the first place.
218,DEAN,Sam.
218,DEAN,If you're serious and you want back in...you should hang on to this. I'm sure you're rusty.
218,DEAN,"Look, man, I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm...whatever I need to be. But I was, uh—wrong."
218,SAM,What made you change your mind?
218,DEAN,"Long story. The point is...maybe we are each other's Achilles heel. Maybe they'll find a way to use us against each other, I don't know. I just know we're all we've got. More than that. We keep each other human."
218,SAM,Thank you. Really. Thank you. I won't let you down.
218,DEAN,"Oh, I know it. I mean, you are the second-best hunter on the planet."
218,SAM,"So, what do we do now?"
218,DEAN,We make our own future.
218,SAM,Guess we have no choice.
219,DEAN,You chose a demon over your own brother. I just don't think I can trust you.
219,DEAN,"Well, have you?"
219,SAM,I know you don't trust me.
219,DEAN,So what are you saying?
219,SAM,Maybe it's best we just go our separate ways.
219,DEAN,"Well, I think you're right."
219,LUCIFER,"You're the one, Sam. You're my vessel."
219,SAM,That'll never happen.
219,ZACHARIAH,You're the Michael sword.
219,DEAN,"What do you mean, I'm the sword?"
219,ZACHARIAH,You're Michael's weapon.
219,DEAN,I'm a vessel?
219,SAM,I won't let you down.
219,DEAN,"Oh, I know it."
219,JIM,"All right, buddy, what's so important you couldn't tell me over the phone?"
219,CAL,"Trust me, Jim. It's important."
219,JIM,"Wait a minute, you're not...you're not telling me that this is—"
219,CAL,Yep.
219,JIM,You found it?
219,JIM,You found it. Huh.
219,JIM,Oh my God! You sure?
219,CAL,VIN numbers match.
219,JIM,How much you pay?
219,CAL,A lot.
219,JIM,"Come on, how much?"
219,CAL,A lot.
219,JIM,I bet. Wow.
219,JIM,Wow. You start her up yet?
219,CAL,Been waiting for you.
219,JIM,"Yeah, waiting to rub my nose in it, right?"
219,CAL,Exactly.
219,JIM,"Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. We need to record this for posterity's sake."
219,CAL,Great idea.
219,JIM,"Yeah, great idea."
219,JIM,"Oh, man."
219,JIM,Cal? Cal?
219,JIM,"Hey, you all right, man? I thought I heard something. Cal? Is something wrong?"
219,JIM,"Oh my God, Cal."
219,JIM,Cal!
219,SAM,So—
219,SAM,—what's with this job?
219,DEAN,Dude suffers a head-on collision in a parked car? I'd say that's worth checking out.
219,SAM,"Yeah, definitely, uh, but, uh, we got bigger problems, don't you think?"
219,DEAN,I'm sure the apocalypse'll still be there when we get back.
219,SAM,"Right, yeah, but I mean, if—if the Colt is really out there somewhere—"
219,DEAN,"Hey, we've been looking for three weeks, we got bupkis."
219,SAM,"Okay. But Dean...I mean, if we're gonna—ice the Devil—"
219,DEAN,This is what we're doing! Okay? End of discussion.
219,DEAN,"It's just that this is our first real case, back at it together. You know, I, I think we oughta ease into it, put the training wheels back on."
219,SAM,So you think I need training wheels.
219,DEAN,"No, 'we'. 'We' need training wheels, you and me. As a team. Okay?"
219,SAM,Okay.
219,DEAN,"Man, I really want this to be a fresh start, you know? For the both of us."
219,SAM,Okay.
219,DEAN,Agents Bonham and Copeland.
219,SHERIFF,Rick Carnegie. Good to know ya. So you're here on account of Cal Hawkins' death?
219,SAM,That's right.
219,CARNEGIE,"Well, 'fraid you came a long way for nothing. We already booked the guy that did it."
219,SAM,I'm sorry; who do you think did it?
219,CARNEGIE,Sicko taped his own handiwork.
219,SAM,I don't follow.
219,CARNEGIE,It was Jim Grossman that killed Cal.
219,DEAN,"Wait, what?"
219,CARNEGIE,"Well, he was the only one on the scene for miles."
219,SAM,They were best friends.
219,CARNEGIE,Most violent crimes are committed by someone close to the victim.
219,DEAN,And how exactly did Jim slam Cal into a windshield with all the force of an eighty-mile-per-hour crash?
219,CARNEGIE,"Drugs, maybe?"
219,CARNEGIE,"Look, you know this ain't brain surgery, boys! Whatever it looks like, that's what it usually is. It's simple."
219,DEAN,Simple. Right.
219,SAM,"Right. Um, if you don't mind, we'd like to speak to Jim Grossman anyway."
219,JIM,"I was in the house when it happened, I didn't even see it."
219,DEAN,"For argument's sake, say we believe you."
219,JIM,Why would you? The cops didn't.
219,DEAN,Well we're not your typical cops.
219,SAM,"Please, just tell us what you saw."
219,JIM,"It's not what I saw, it's what I heard. Tires squealing, glass breaking."
219,JIM,It was the car that did it.
219,SAM,The car?
219,JIM,"I mean, I heard about the curse, but, I just thought it was a load of crap."
219,DEAN,"Curse, what do you—what do you mean, curse?"
219,JIM,The car. Little Bastard.
219,SAM,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, uh, what's Little Bastard?"
219,DEAN,It's James Dean's car. It's the one he was killed in.
219,JIM,"Yeah, that's the one. Cal had been looking for it for years. I mean, hell, we both had. But he found it first."
219,DEAN,"Oh, we are definitely checking this out."
219,SAM,"So, what, this is, like, Christine?"
219,DEAN,Christine is fiction. This—
219,DEAN,This is real.
219,SAM,Okay.
219,SAM,Enlighten me.
219,DEAN,"Well after James Dean died, his mechanic—"
219,DEAN,"—bought the wreckage, and he fixed it up."
219,DEAN,And it repaid him by...
219,DEAN,Falling on him.
219,DEAN,And Tony McHenry was killed when it locked up on the racetrack.
219,DEAN,"I mean, death follows this car around like exhaust. Nobody touches it and comes away in one piece."
219,SAM,Hm.
219,DEAN,"Then, in nineteen-seventy, it vanished off the back of a truck. Nobody's ever seen it since."
219,DEAN,"I'm telling you, man, if this—if this car is Little Bastard, I will bet you dollars to donuts it's what killed the guy."
219,SAM,So how do we find out?
219,DEAN,"Cal matched the VIN number, but the only real way to know is the engine number."
219,SAM,I'm guessing the engine number—?
219,DEAN,On the engine. Yeah.
219,SAM,You want me to do it?
219,DEAN,"No. ...No, no, I've—I've got it."
219,DEAN,"Okay, baby. I'm not gonna hurt you, so...don't hurt me."
219,SAM,Need a flashlight?
219,DEAN,"No. Don't...do anything, just go away."
219,SAM,"You—uh, okay."
219,DEAN,"Don't speak. All right? In fact, don't even look at her, she might not like it."
219,DEAN,"Find out who owned it. Not just the last owner, you gotta take it all the way back to nineteen-fifty-five."
219,SAM,That's a lot of research.
219,DEAN,"Well, I guess I just made your afternoon."
219,DEAN,"So, you wanna be an actress, huh?"
219,BARTENDER,Yeah.
219,DEAN,"That is—that is so funny, because, I am actually—"
219,DEAN,—an agent for William Morris Endeavor.
219,BARTENDER,Wow.
219,DEAN,You mind filling me up again?
219,BARTENDER,Yeah.
219,DEAN,"Thanks, hey, you're a star. All right?"
219,DEAN,Yo.
219,SAM,"Hey. Took me a while, but I traced all the car's previous owners."
219,DEAN,Any of 'em die bloody?
219,SAM,Nope. In fact—
219,SAM,"Dean, are you in a bar?"
219,DEAN,"No, I—I'm—I'm in a restaurant."
219,BARTENDER,Here's your beer.
219,DEAN,Thanks.
219,DEAN,That happens to have a bar.
219,SAM,I've been working my ass off here.
219,DEAN,"Hey, world's smallest violin, pal, I spent the afternoon up Christine's skirt. I needed a drink."
219,SAM,"Actually, you didn't."
219,DEAN,Meaning?
219,SAM,The car's first owner was a cardiologist in Philadelphia; drove it 'til he died in nineteen-seventy-two.
219,DEAN,So you're saying?
219,SAM,"That Porsche is not, nor has it ever been, James Dean's car. It's a fake Little Bastard."
219,DEAN,Well then what was it that killed the guy?
219,SAM,Good question.
219,CONSUELA,"Okay Mister Hill, I finish."
219,HILL,"Thank you, Consuela. Have a good night."
219,HILL,Oh my God. It's you.
219,HILL,You're dead. You're supposed to be dead.
219,HILL,"No. No, no, no."
219,CARNEGIE,"I want you to use a, a fine-tooth comb. The evidence is here, we just gotta find it."
219,DEAN,Heard you got another weird one.
219,CARNEGIE,"Uh, well, it's a—it's a little strange on the surface, I admit, but, uh...you know, once you—you look at the facts..."
219,SAM,"William Hill died from a gunshot wound to the head. No gun, no gunpowder, no bullet."
219,DEAN,Nope. Nothing strange about that.
219,CARNEGIE,Well there's gotta be a reasonable explanation. There always is.
219,DEAN,Well what's your reasonable explanation?
219,CARNEGIE,Professional killer.
219,SAM,Come again?
219,CARNEGIE,"Well, CIA, NSA, one o' them trained assassins, like in Michael Clayton."
219,DEAN,Right.
219,CARNEGIE,"You're welcome to look around, but—but these guys don't leave fingerprints."
219,SAM,Mind if we talk with the witness?
219,CARNEGIE,Be my guest. She's not making any sense! And she's not making any sense in Spanish either.
219,DEAN,Right.
219,CONSUELA,No puedo vivir aquí. Necesito mi familia. Me voy ahora. Me voy a la casa. No—me voy a la casa en El Salvador ahora.
219,DEAN,Consuela Alvarez?
219,CONSUELA,Yes?
219,DEAN,FBI.
219,DEAN,"Now, uh, you said you saw something in the professor's house. Right? Something in the window?"
219,CONSUELA,Estaba sacando la basura. Imiré por la ventana y vi al hombre que mató al Señor Hill!
219,SAM,"Uh, Señora Alvarez. Cálmese, por favor. Uh—"
219,SAM,"Uh, díganos lo que vio?"
219,DEAN,Nice.
219,SAM,Freshman Spanish.
219,CONSUELA,Era alto. Muy alto. Y llevaba el abrigo negro largo y tenía bigotes.
219,SAM,"Okay, uh, a tall man, very tall. With a long black coat and a—"
219,SAM,A beard?
219,SAM,Beard.
219,CONSUELA,Y un sombrero.
219,DEAN,Dude was wearing a sombrero?
219,SAM,"Uh, a hat, not a—a—"
219,CONSUELA,"No, no, no, un sombrero alto."
219,SAM,A tall hat?
219,DEAN,"Oh, like a top hat."
219,CONSUELA,Un sombrero alto.
219,CONSUELA,Muy alto!
219,DEAN,"What, you mean like a—like a stovepipe hat."
219,CONSUELA,Sí.
219,DEAN,"Oh yeah, like Abraham Lincoln."
219,CONSUELA,Sí. El Presidente Lincoln.
219,CONSUELA,Abraham Lincoln kill Mister Hill!
219,DEAN,Huh.
219,CONSUELA,S-so I go home now?
219,SAM,"Uh, sí. Gracias."
219,DEAN,Gracias.
219,DEAN,Whoa.
219,SAM,What?
219,DEAN,It's a freeze-frame from Jim Grossman's video.
219,DEAN,"Am I crazy, or does that look like James Dean?"
219,SAM,That looks like James Dean.
219,DEAN,Famous ghosts?
219,SAM,Maybe.
219,DEAN,Well that's just silly.
219,SAM,"No, actually, uh, there is a ton of lore on famous ghosts. More than the, you know, not-famous kinds. I'm actually surprised we haven't run into one before."
219,DEAN,"Yeah, but now we got two of 'em? Two extremely pissed-off ghosts?"
219,SAM,Who are apparently ganking their fans.
219,DEAN,What do you mean?
219,SAM,Professor Hill was a Civil War nut. He dug Lincoln.
219,DEAN,And Cal must've been a James Dean freak. He spent seventeen years of his life tracking down the guy's car.
219,DEAN,"So you're saying we've got two super-famous, super-pissed-off ghosts killing their...super-fans?"
219,SAM,That's what it looks like.
219,DEAN,"Well, that is muchos loco."
219,SAM,'Muy'.
219,SAM,Not 'muchos'.
219,DEAN,"Yeah, well, the big question is, what the hell are they doing here?"
219,SAM,"Yeah. Ghosts usually haunt the places they live. I mean, I, I get Abraham Lincoln at the White House—"
219,DEAN,"And James Dean at a race track, but...what the hell are they doing in Canton?"
219,SAM,You gotta be kidding me.
219,DEAN,What?
219,DEAN,You gotta be kidding me.
219,DEAN,"Dude, he's short."
219,SAM,Hey. Gandhi was a great man.
219,DEAN,"Yeah, for a Smurf."
219,OWNER,"Sorry to keep you waiting, this is our busiest time of the year."
219,DEAN,This is busy?
219,OWNER,"Well, not right now, but it's early."
219,DEAN,It's four-thirty.
219,OWNER,"So, what can I do for you?"
219,DEAN,"Yeah, on how, uh, totally non-sucky wax museums are."
219,OWNER,"That's fantastic. A little press, just what we need."
219,SAM,"Great. Well we're interested in a few of your exhibits, specifically Abraham Lincoln and, uh, James Dean."
219,OWNER,Two of our most popular displays.
219,SAM,Oh yeah? So they bring in a lot of visitors?
219,OWNER,"Yeah, we have our regulars."
219,DEAN,"I don't suppose that, uh, William Hill and Cal Hawkins were regulars, were they?"
219,OWNER,"As a matter of fact, they were. Yeah, I heard what happened to them. It's tragic, just tragic. Oh—you—that's not gonna be in the article, is it?"
219,SAM,"No. No, no. 'Course not."
219,DEAN,"You know, I gotta tell you, that—that Lincoln is so lifelike, I mean, you—I mean, you can just imagine him moving around. You ever see anything like that?"
219,OWNER,Uh...no.
219,DEAN,No?
219,SAM,"Well, um, is there anything you could think of that would make your museum...unusual? You know, for the article?"
219,OWNER,"Well, I'll say. There isn't another place like us, not anywhere."
219,DEAN,How so?
219,OWNER,"Well, for one, that's Honest Abe's real hat."
219,SAM,It is?
219,DEAN,Almost like his remains.
219,OWNER,Uh...I guess?
219,SAM,"You wouldn't happen to have any of James Dean's personal effects, would you?"
219,OWNER,"Ooh, yeah. Got his keychain. We got a bunch of stuff, uh, Gandhi's bifocals, FDR's iron lung. This."
219,SAM,And who did that belong to?
219,OWNER,The Fonz. Seasons two through four!
219,SAM,"W-wow. Yeah, that's—that's really cool...ish."
219,OWNER,This? This is nothing. I've been working on a new collection of figures. Stuff that'll really wow the kids.
219,DEAN,The kids?
219,OWNER,"Yeah, Gen Y."
219,OWNER,"Computer games, cell phones, sexting."
219,OWNER,They're just fads. I'm gonna make wax museums hip again.
219,DEAN,"Yeah, Abraham Lincoln and James Dean, can you believe that? ...Why so kill-crazy? Ah, maybe the apocalypse has got 'em all hot and bothered. Yeah, well, we all know whose fault that is. ...Well I'm sorry, but it's true."
219,DEAN,I'll call you later. Bye.
219,SAM,What's going on?
219,DEAN,Did you get the trunk packed up?
219,SAM,"Yeah, trunk's packed. Who was on the phone?"
219,DEAN,Bobby.
219,SAM,And?
219,DEAN,Nothing.
219,SAM,So we're just gonna pretend I didn't hear what I just heard?
219,DEAN,Pretend or don't pretend. Whatever floats your boat.
219,SAM,"This was supposed to be a fresh start, Dean."
219,DEAN,"Well, this is about as fresh as it gets. Now are we going or not?"
219,DEAN,Check it out.
219,DEAN,"Four score and seven years ago, I had a funny hat."
219,SAM,Dean.
219,DEAN,We can't have any fun with this?
219,SAM,"Let's just torch the objects, torch the ghosts, get outta here. Okay?"
219,DEAN,I'll go grab East of Eden's keychain.
219,SAM,Dean?
219,SAM,Dean?
219,SAM,Dean!
219,DEAN,Is that Gandhi?
219,SAM,Yeah!
219,DEAN,"Dude, he's squirrelly."
219,SAM,Get the—
219,SAM,Do it!
219,DEAN,Get the what?
219,SAM,Glasses!
219,DEAN,You couldn't have been a fan of someone cool?
219,DEAN,Really? Gandhi?
219,DEAN,Ready to blow this joint?
219,SAM,"Dean, didn't it strike you as strange the way Gandhi just...vanished?"
219,DEAN,Strange how?
219,SAM,"No screaming, no big flame-out, I mean, that isn't the way ghosts usually go."
219,DEAN,"Still, I torched, he vanished."
219,SAM,"Yeah, but I—"
219,SAM,"Also, I feel like he was...trying to take a bite out of me."
219,DEAN,A bite?
219,SAM,"Yeah, like he was hungry. But the thing is, Gandhi—or, the real Gandhi—he was a—"
219,DEAN,A what?
219,DEAN,Spit it out.
219,SAM,He was a fruitarian.
219,DEAN,"Let me get this straight. Your, uh, ultimate hero was not only a short man in diapers, but he was also a fruitarian?"
219,SAM,That's not the point.
219,DEAN,"That is good. That is—even for you, that is good."
219,SAM,"Look, I'm just saying, I'm not so sure this thing is over."
219,DEAN,"It was a ghost. It was a weirdly super-charged fruitarian ghost, but it was still a ghost. Now let's go."
219,SAM,"So first you drag me into town, and now you're dragging me back out."
219,DEAN,"You ain't steering this boat. Let's go, chop chop."
219,SAM,"You know, this isn't gonna work."
219,DEAN,What isn't?
219,SAM,"Us. You, me, together, I—I thought it could, but it can't."
219,DEAN,"You're the one that wanted back in, chief."
219,SAM,And you're the one who called me back in.
219,DEAN,I still think we got some trust building to do.
219,SAM,How long am I gonna be on double-secret probation?
219,DEAN,Till I say so.
219,SAM,"Look. I know what I did. What I've done. And I am trying to climb out of that hole, I am, but you're not making it any easier."
219,DEAN,"So what am I supposed to do, just let you off the hook?"
219,SAM,"No. You can think whatever you want. I deserve it, and worse. Hell, you'll never punish me as much as I'm punishing myself, but the point is, if we're gonna be a team, you and I—it has to be a two-way street."
219,DEAN,So we just go back to the way we were before?
219,SAM,"No, because we were never that way before. Before didn't work."
219,SAM,How do you think we got here?
219,DEAN,What's that supposed to mean?
219,SAM,"Dean, one of the reasons I went off with Ruby...was to get away from you."
219,DEAN,What?
219,SAM,It made me feel strong. Like I wasn't your kid brother.
219,DEAN,Are you saying this is my fault?
219,SAM,"No, it's my fault. All I'm saying is that, if we're gonna do this, we have to do it different, we can't just fall into the same rut."
219,DEAN,What do you want me to do?
219,SAM,"You're gonna have to let me grow up, for starters."
219,DEAN,Yeah?
219,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, okay."
219,DEAN,I guess you were right about this not being over.
219,SAM,Sheriff Carnegie?
219,DEAN,"Sheriff, what happened?"
219,CARNEGIE,"I, uh, uh..."
219,CARNEGIE,I don't know!
219,DEAN,"Excuse us, girls. Hi, we're with the FBI."
219,SAM,Can you tell us what happened?
219,SAM,What was horrible?
219,DEAN,Believe what?
219,DEAN,Who?
219,SAM,"It's okay, you're safe, just, tell us. Who took your friend?"
219,SAM,Sorry?
219,DEAN,What—wait—huh?
219,SAM,"Uh, um...where did they go?"
219,DEAN,Would you excuse us for just a minute?
219,DEAN,"Paris Hilton's not dead as far as we know, right?"
219,SAM,"Pretty sure, no."
219,DEAN,Which means it's not a—
219,SAM,Ghost. No.
219,DEAN,"So, what? Paris Hilton is a homicidal maniac—"
219,SAM,Or we missed something.
219,DEAN,What do you wanna do?
219,SAM,That's right.
219,SAM,What the hell?
219,SAM,I can't believe I missed it.
219,DEAN,Missed what?
219,SAM,Went back over the other two vics. There was blood loss. Major.
219,DEAN,"Oh, well, being a gory smear will do that to you."
219,SAM,"No, I—I mean more blood loss than a—a car crash or a head wound should cause, almost like it—"
219,DEAN,Something's feeding.
219,SAM,Yeah.
219,DEAN,Awesome.
219,SAM,And then—
219,SAM,There were these.
219,DEAN,"What are those, seeds?"
219,SAM,Yeah. They were in both vics' bellies.
219,DEAN,I hope you washed your hands.
219,SAM,"They're unlike any seed I've ever seen before, Dean."
219,DEAN,"Wow, just when I thought you couldn't get any geekier."
219,SAM,Yahtzee.
219,DEAN,What?
219,SAM,"The seeds aren't from around here. In fact, they're not from any tree or plant in the country."
219,DEAN,Where are they from?
219,SAM,"Eastern Europe. From a forest in the Balkans, which is not even there anymore. It was chopped down, like, thirty years ago."
219,DEAN,So?
219,SAM,"So, local legend has it that the forest was guarded by a pagan god whose name was Leshi. Um, a mischievous god, could take on infinite forms—"
219,DEAN,And let me guess. He liked to munch on his fans.
219,SAM,"Yep. Could be appeased only with the blood from his worshippers. It would drain 'em, then stuff their stomachs with the seeds."
219,DEAN,"So how's he doing it? What, he touches James Dean's keychain and then morphs into James Dean?"
219,SAM,Hm. It's as good a guess as any.
219,DEAN,"Yeah, well, whatever. How do we kill him?"
219,SAM,Says here to chop off his head with an iron axe.
219,DEAN,All right. Let's go gank ourselves a Paris Hilton.
219,SAM,Hey.
219,DEAN,She alive?
219,SAM,Yeah. Barely.
219,LESHI,Awesome.
219,LESHI,Oh. I'm so glad you're awake for this. This is gonna be huge.
219,DEAN,"Super. Yeah, I wouldn't wanna miss it."
219,LESHI,"I mean, I've been stuffing myself with fast food lately. So it's nice to do the ritual right. Prepare a nice, slow meal for a change."
219,SAM,"Just like the good old days, huh?"
219,LESHI,"You have no idea. People adored me. They used to throw themselves at me, with smiles on their faces."
219,DEAN,"Yeah, I guess these days nobody gives a flying crap about some backwoods forest god, huh?"
219,LESHI,No. Not since they cut down my forest and built a Yugo plant.
219,DEAN,"March of progress, sister."
219,LESHI,"For years now, I've been wandering. Hungry. Scared. Scrounging for scraps. So not sexy."
219,LESHI,"But then, the best thing ever happened."
219,LESHI,"Someone tripped the apocalypse. And I thought, what the hell, I'm tired of watching what I eat. I wanna pig out. So I found this little place. It's awesome. Adoring fans stroll right in the door."
219,SAM,Yeah. But they're not your fans.
219,LESHI,"So? They worship Lincoln, Gandhi, Hilton...whatever. I'll take what I can get."
219,DEAN,"You know, I gotta tell you, you are not the first god we've met, but you are...the nuttiest."
219,LESHI,"No, you, you people, you're the crazy ones. You used to worship gods. But this?"
219,LESHI,This is what passes for idolatry? Celebrities? What have they got besides small dogs and spray tans?
219,LESHI,"Maybe, but...there's still a lot of yummy meat on those bones, boy."
219,LESHI,"No. But I can totally read your mind, Dean. I know who your hero is. Your daddy. Am I right?"
219,LESHI,"And this belonged to him. Didn't it? Poor little Dean. All you ever wanted was to be loved by your idol. One distant father figure, coming right up."
219,DEAN,Not a word.
219,SAM,Dude. You just got whaled on by Paris Hilton!
219,DEAN,Shut up.
219,SAM,Glad she's okay.
219,DEAN,It gets better. Sheriff's putting out an APB on Paris Hilton.
219,DEAN,That oughta be good.
219,DEAN,"Hey, listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday. About me keeping too tight of a leash on you."
219,DEAN,"Hell, maybe you're right. I mean, look, I'm not exactly Mister Innocent in this whole mess either, you know. I did break the first seal."
219,SAM,You didn't know.
219,DEAN,"Yeah, well, neither did you."
219,DEAN,"I'm not saying demon blood was a great way to go, but, you did kill Lilith."
219,SAM,And start the apocalypse.
219,DEAN,"Which neither of us saw coming, I mean, who'd have thought killing Lilith would've been a bad thing?"
219,DEAN,"Point is, I was so worried about watching your every move that I didn't see what it was actually doing to you."
219,DEAN,"So, for that I'm sorry."
219,SAM,Thanks.
219,DEAN,So where do we go from here?
219,SAM,"They way I see it, we got one shot at surviving this."
219,DEAN,What's that?
219,SAM,"Maybe I am on deck for the devil, maybe same with you and Michael, maybe there's no changing that."
219,DEAN,Well that's encouraging.
219,DEAN,I can get on board with that.
219,SAM,Okay. But we're gonna have to do it on the same level.
219,DEAN,You got it.
219,DEAN,I say we get the hell outta here.
219,SAM,Hell yeah.
219,DEAN,Hey.
219,DEAN,You wanna drive?
219,SAM,You sure?
219,DEAN,"Yeah, I could, uh...I could use a nap."
220,DEAN,"You chose a demon over your own brother, and look what happened."
220,SAM,I'm sorry. I would give anything—
220,DEAN,I know you would.
220,SAM,It has to be a two-way street.
220,DEAN,I can get on board with that.
220,AMBER,Jimmy?
220,JIMMY,I can't. I'm dead.
220,AMBER,What is this—ketchup? Gross!
220,JIMMY,Ow! You're mean.
220,AMBER,"Yeah, that's what your parents pay me for—to be mean."
220,AMBER,Bed—now!
220,JIMMY,"Okay, okay. Just wait."
220,AMBER,Oh! Go!
220,DEAN,"Agents Page and Plant, FBI."
220,DOCTOR,Gentlemen. What brings you by?
220,SAM,We need to see Amber Freer's body.
220,DOCTOR,Really? What for?
220,DEAN,The police report said something clawed through her skull?
220,DOCTOR,You didn't read the autopsy report that I emailed out this morning?
220,SAM,"W-we had, uh, server issues."
220,DOCTOR,"When they brought her in, we thought she was attacked by a wolf or something."
220,DEAN,Or something.
220,DOCTOR,But we were wrong.
220,SAM,Is that a—
220,DOCTOR,It's a press-on nail. We found it in her temporal lobe.
220,SAM,Is that even possible?
220,DEAN,"Wait, are you—you saying that she did this to herself?"
220,DOCTOR,"Uh-huh. She scratched her brains out. It'd take hours, and it'd hurt like hell, but sure—it's possible."
220,DEAN,How?
220,DOCTOR,"Pick your acronym—OCD, PCP. It all spells crazy."
220,DOCTOR,"My guess, some kind of phantom itch. I mean, an extreme case, but..."
220,SAM,Phantom itch?
220,DOCTOR,Yup.
220,DOCTOR,"All it takes is someone talking about an itch—or thinking about one, even—and suddenly you can't stop scratching."
220,SAM,"Thanks, doc."
220,SAM,"Okay. Okay, now, some of these questions might seem a bit odd, but please just bear with me."
220,SAM,Have you noticed any cold spots in the house?
220,SAM,"Okay, uh, what about strange smells?"
220,JIMMY,Whatcha lookin' for?
220,DEAN,Don't know yet.
220,DEAN,"It's, uh, Jimmy, right?"
220,DEAN,"So, Amber was your babysitter?"
220,JIMMY,"Yes, sir."
220,DEAN,"Yeah, most of my babysitters sucked."
220,DEAN,Especially Ms. Chancey. She only cared about two things.
220,DEAN,"Did you, uh, you see anything strange that night?"
220,JIMMY,"No, sir."
220,DEAN,You sure about that?
220,JIMMY,I—I would tell you if I knew something.
220,JIMMY,I promise. One hundred percent. Cross my heart.
220,DEAN,"Well, Jimmy, I, uh...I happen to know you're lying."
220,JIMMY,I'm not.
220,DEAN,"We gonna start talking truth, or are you and me gonna have to take a little trip downtown?"
220,DEAN,Kid said he put this on the babysitter's hairbrush.
220,SAM,"Dean, there's no way—"
220,SAM,—itching powder made that girl scratch her brains out. It's just ground-up maple seeds.
220,DEAN,"If you have any other theories, I'm open to 'em."
220,SAM,"Yeah? ...Yeah, we'll be right there."
220,SAM,What happened?
220,DOCTOR,Guy got electrocuted.
220,DEAN,Any idea how?
220,DOCTOR,"Eh, maybe a loose wire or a piece of equipment shorted out. So far, we haven't found anything."
220,SAM,Witnesses?
220,DOCTOR,"Yeah, guy in there—Mr. Stanley."
220,DOCTOR,"He says he saw it, but he's not making a lick of sense. Senile."
220,SAM,Thanks.
220,SAM,"Um, Mr. Stanley?"
220,STANLEY,It was just a joke. I didn't know it would really work.
220,DEAN,What would work?
220,STANLEY,All I did was shake his hand.
220,DEAN,You ready?
220,SAM,"Hit it, Mr. Wizard."
220,DEAN,"That'll do, pig."
220,SAM,What the hell?
220,SAM,That crap isn't supposed to work.
220,DEAN,This thing doesn't even have batteries.
220,SAM,"So...so, what? Are—are we looking at cursed objects?"
220,DEAN,Sounds good.
220,DEAN,Maybe there's a powerful witch in town.
220,DEAN,"Is there any link between the, uh, the joy buzzer and the itching powder?"
220,SAM,"Uh, one was made in China, the other Mexico, but they were both bought from the same store."
220,DEAN,Hmm.
220,DEAN,Sam!
220,OWNER,"Welcome to the Conjurarium, sanctum of magic and mystery."
220,SAM,You the owner?
220,OWNER,Yep.
220,DEAN,You sold any itching powder or joy buzzers lately?
220,OWNER,"Yeah, a grand total of one of each. They aren't exactly big-ticket items. Look, you boys here to buy something or what?"
220,SAM,"So, you get many customers?"
220,OWNER,"Kids come in. They don't buy much, but they're more than happy to break stuff. These days, all they care about are their iPhones and those kissing-vampire movies. The whole thing makes me just—"
220,DEAN,Angry?
220,OWNER,"Yeah. Yeah, I am angry. This shop has been my life for twenty years, and now it's wasting away to nothing."
220,DEAN,Which is why you hate them.
220,OWNER,I suppose.
220,DEAN,You wish there was something you could do about it.
220,OWNER,"Yeah, I guess I do."
220,DEAN,So you're taking revenge.
220,DEAN,With this.
220,OWNER,Oh! No!
220,SAM,"Yeah, something tells me this guy is not a powerful witch."
220,DEAN,Sorry. Sorry.
220,GIRL,"So some freak is gonna come in my room while I'm sleeping and take my tooth? Sounds scary. No, thank you."
220,DEAN,"Well, I, uh, appreciate that, Nurse..."
220,DEAN,Fremont.
220,FREMONT,Please—call me Jen.
220,DEAN,Oh. Jen it is.
220,DEAN,What's up with Toothless? Cavity creeps get ahold of him?
220,SAM,Yeah. Close. He wrote up a description.
220,SAM,"Five foot ten, three hundred fifty pounds, wings, and a pink tutu. Said it was the tooth fairy."
220,DEAN,So he's obviously whacked out on painkillers.
220,SAM,Maybe. Whatever it was got past locked doors and windows without triggering the alarm.
220,DEAN,Come on. Tooth fairy?
220,SAM,And it left thirty-two quarters underneath his pillow. One for each tooth.
220,DEAN,"Well, I will see your crazy and raise you some. There's a couple of kids upstairs with stomach ulcers—say they got it from mixing Pop Rocks and Coke. Another guy...his face...froze that way."
220,SAM,What way?
220,DEAN,"He, uh, held it too long, and it—it stuck. They're flying in a plastic surgeon."
220,SAM,"So, I mean, if you add all that up..."
220,SAM,I got nothing.
220,DEAN,I thought sea-monkeys were real.
220,SAM,They are. They're brine shrimp.
220,DEAN,"No, no, no, I mean like in the ads. You know, like the sea-monkey wife cooks the pot roast for the sea-monkey husband, and the sea-monkey kids play with the dog in a sea-monkey castle—real. I mean, I was six, but I believed it."
220,SAM,Okay.
220,DEAN,Point is...
220,DEAN,"Maybe that's the connection. The tooth fairy, the Pop Rocks and Coke, the joy buzzer that shocks you—they're all lies that kids believe."
220,SAM,"And now they're coming true. Okay, so whatever's doing this is—is reshaping reality. It has the powers of a god. Or—"
220,SAM,—of a trickster.
220,DEAN,"Yeah, with the sense of humor of a nine-year-old."
220,SAM,Or you.
220,SAM,"Dude, seriously—still with the ham?"
220,DEAN,We don't have a fridge.
220,SAM,"Well, I found something."
220,SAM,"Um, tooth fairy attack was here, Pop Rocks and Coke was here, then you've got itching powder, face freeze, and joy buzzer—all located within a two-mile radius."
220,DEAN,"So, we got a blast zone of weird, and inside, fantasy becomes reality."
220,SAM,Looks like.
220,DEAN,And what's the A-bomb at its center?
220,SAM,Four acres of farmland...and a house.
220,DEAN,"Our motel isn't in that circle, by any chance?"
220,SAM,Yeah. Why?
220,SAM,"Ugh, dude—"
220,SAM,"That's not what I think it is, is it?"
220,DEAN,I got bored. That nurse was hot.
220,SAM,"You know you can go blind from that, too."
220,DEAN,Give me five minutes. We'll go check out that house.
220,SAM,"Hey, do not use my razor!"
220,JESSE,Can I help you?
220,SAM,"Hi. Uh, what's your name?"
220,JESSE,Who wants to know?
220,DEAN,"The, uh..."
220,DEAN,FBI.
220,JESSE,Let me see that.
220,JESSE,"So, what, you guys don't knock?"
220,DEAN,Are your parents home?
220,JESSE,They work.
220,SAM,"Well, you mind if we ask you a few questions, maybe take a look around the house?"
220,JESSE,I don't know.
220,DEAN,Come on. You can trust us. We're the authorities.
220,SAM,What's that?
220,JESSE,It's called soup.
220,JESSE,You heat it up and you eat it.
220,SAM,"Right. I, I know. It's just, um...I used to make my own dinner, too, when I was a kid."
220,JESSE,"Well, I'm not a kid."
220,SAM,"Right. No, I, I know. Um..."
220,SAM,"I'm Robert, by the way."
220,JESSE,Jesse.
220,SAM,"Jesse, nice to meet you."
220,DEAN,Did you draw this?
220,JESSE,It's the tooth fairy.
220,DEAN,"That's what you think the tooth fairy looks like, huh?"
220,JESSE,Yeah. My dad told me about him.
220,DEAN,Huh.
220,JESSE,"What, didn't your dad tell you about the tooth fairy?"
220,DEAN,My dad?
220,DEAN,My dad told me different stories.
220,JESSE,"Well, the tooth fairy isn't a story."
220,JESSE,"What do you know about itching powder, Jesse?"
220,JESSE,That stuff will make you scratch your brains out.
220,DEAN,Pop Rocks and Coke?
220,JESSE,"You mix them, and you'll end up in the hospital. Everyone knows that."
220,JESSE,You shouldn't have that.
220,DEAN,Why not?
220,JESSE,It can electrocute you.
220,DEAN,"Actually, it can't. It's just a wind-up toy. It's totally harmless. Doesn't even have batteries."
220,JESSE,So it can't shock you?
220,DEAN,Nope. Not at all. I swear.
220,JESSE,Oh. Okay.
220,DEAN,"I mean, all it does is just shake in your hand. It's kind of lame. See?"
220,DEAN,"What did you say your name was, again?"
220,SAM,"Dude, what the hell?"
220,DEAN,I had a hunch. I went with it.
220,SAM,You risked my ass on a hunch?
220,DEAN,You're fine.
220,SAM,"Besides, now we know who's turning this town into Willy Wonka's worst nightmare."
220,SAM,The kid.
220,DEAN,"Yeah. Everything Jesse believes comes true. He thinks the tooth fairy looks like Belushi, uh, joy buzzers really shock people, boom, that's what happens."
220,SAM,"Yeah, but convince him the joy buzzers don't actually work, and they go from killing machines back into crap toys."
220,DEAN,He probably doesn't even know he's doing it.
220,DEAN,How is he doing it?
220,SAM,"So, dug up what I could on Jesse Turner. It's not much. Uh, B student, won last year's Pinewood Derby. But get this. Jesse was adopted. His birth records are sealed."
220,DEAN,"So you unsealed them, and?"
220,SAM,"There's no father listed, but Jesse's biological mom is named Julia Wright. She lives in Elk Creek, on the other side of the state."
220,JULIA,"Whatever you're selling, I'm not interested."
220,DEAN,"We're not salesmen. Agents Page and Plant, FBI."
220,JULIA,"Put your badge in the slot. Your partner's, too."
220,JULIA,What do you want?
220,SAM,Um...
220,SAM,We just had a few questions. About your son.
220,JULIA,I don't have a son.
220,SAM,"He was born March twenty-ninth, nineteen ninety-eight, in Omaha."
220,SAM,You put him up for adoption?
220,JULIA,What about him?
220,SAM,"We were just wondering, um, was it...was it a normal pregnancy?"
220,DEAN,Was there anything strange?
220,JULIA,Stay away from me!
220,DEAN,"Mrs. Wright, wait!"
220,DEAN,We just want to talk!
220,JULIA,You're not demons?
220,DEAN,How do you know about demons?
220,JULIA,"I was possessed. A demon took control of my body, and I hurt people. I killed people."
220,SAM,"That, that wasn't you."
220,JULIA,But I was there. I heard a woman beg for mercy. I...felt a young girl's blood drip down my hands.
220,DEAN,That's how you knew about the salt.
220,JULIA,"Yeah, I picked up tricks. It was in my head for months."
220,DEAN,How many months?
220,JULIA,Nine.
220,SAM,So your son...
220,JULIA,"Yeah, the whole time. The pregnancy, birth—all of it. I was possessed."
220,JULIA,"The night the baby was born, I was alone. And the pain was—the pain was overwhelming. I, I screamed, and it came out a laugh, because the demon was happy. It used my body to give birth to a child. When it was over, something changed. Maybe the—the demon was tired or if the pain helped me fight it, but..."
220,JULIA,"Somehow, I took control."
220,JULIA,And the demon wailed inside me. It pounded against my skull. I thought my head was gonna explode. But I knew. I knew what I had to do.
220,JULIA,And when I was alone with the baby...
220,JULIA,A part of me...part of me wanted to kill it.
220,JULIA,"But, God help me, I couldn't do that. So, I put it up for adoption, and I ran."
220,DEAN,Who was the father?
220,JULIA,I was a virgin.
220,JULIA,Have you seen my son? Is he human?
220,DEAN,"His name's Jesse. He lives in, uh, Alliance. He's a good kid."
220,SAM,"So, now what?"
220,DEAN,We need help.
220,SAM,I take it you got our message.
220,CASTIEL,It's lucky you found the boy.
220,DEAN,"Oh, yeah, real lucky. What do we do with him?"
220,CASTIEL,Kill him.
220,DEAN,Cas.
220,CASTIEL,"This child is half demon and half human, but it's far more powerful than either. Other cultures call this hybrid cambion or katako. You know him as the antichrist."
220,CASTIEL,That wasn't me.
220,DEAN,Who put that there?
220,SAM,"Anyway, I don't get it. Jesse is the devil's son?"
220,CASTIEL,"No, of course not. Your Bible gets more wrong than it does right. The antichrist is not Lucifer's child. It's just demon spawn. But it is one of the devil's greatest weapons in the war against heaven."
220,DEAN,"Well, if Jesse's a demonic howitzer, then what the hell's he doing in Nebraska?"
220,CASTIEL,The demons lost him. They can't find him. But they're looking.
220,DEAN,And they lost him because?
220,CASTIEL,Because of the child's power. It hides him from both angels and demons. For now.
220,DEAN,"So he's got, like, a force field around him. Well, that's great. Problem solved."
220,CASTIEL,"With Lucifer risen, this child grows strong. Soon, he will do more than just make a few toys come to life—something that will draw the demons to him. The demons will find this child. Lucifer will twist this boy to his purpose. And then, with a word, this child will destroy the Host of Heaven."
220,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. You're saying that—that Jesse's gonna nuke the angels?"
220,CASTIEL,We cannot allow that to happen.
220,SAM,Wait.
220,SAM,We're the good guys. We—we don't just—kill children.
220,CASTIEL,"A year ago, you would have done whatever it took to win this war."
220,SAM,Things change.
220,DEAN,"Okay. Hey, look, we are not going to kill him. All right? But we can't leave Jesse here either. We know that. So...we take him to Bobby's. He'll know what to do."
220,CASTIEL,"You'll kidnap him? What is going on in this town, it's what happens when this thing is happy. You cannot imagine what it will do if it's angry. Besides, how will you hold him? With a thought, he could be halfway around the world."
220,DEAN,So we—
220,SAM,"So we tell him the truth. You say Jesse's destined to go dark side—fine. But he hasn't yet. So if we lay it all out for him—what he is, the apocalypse, everything—he might make the right choice."
220,CASTIEL,You didn't. And I can't take that chance.
220,SAM,Damn it.
220,JULIA,Oh. Sorry. I'm sorry.
220,MAILMAN,It's—it's no worries. You okay?
220,JULIA,Yeah. It's just today—a little...shaky.
220,MAILMAN,"Ah. Well, talking to the Winchesters will do that to you."
220,MAILMAN,"Don't you recognize me, sweetheart?"
220,DEMON,"We had some great times together, didn't we? And then you stole something from us, hid it away. That was very, very naughty of you. So we watched, and we waited. And now...they told you where he is, didn't they? I think it's time we go and visit our son."
220,CASTIEL,Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
220,JESSE,Mom! Dad!
220,CASTIEL,"Your mother and father are sleeping. I assure you, they won't wake until morning."
220,CASTIEL,I'm sorry.
220,DEAN,Was there a guy here? In a trench coat?
220,JESSE,Was he your friend?
220,DEAN,Him? No.
220,JESSE,I did that. But how did I do that?
220,DEAN,You're a superhero.
220,JESSE,I am?
220,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah. I mean, who else could turn someone into a toy? You're Superman—minus the cape and the go-go boots. See, my—my partner and I, we work for a secret government agency. It's our job to find kids with special powers. In fact, we're here to take you to a hidden base in South Dakota, where you'll be trained to fight evil."
220,JESSE,Like the X-Men?
220,DEAN,Exactly like the X-Men.
220,DEAN,"In fact, the, uh, guy we're taking you to—he's even in a wheelchair. You'll be a hero. You'll save lives. You'll get the girl. Sounds like fun, right?"
220,DEMON,They're lying to you.
220,DEMON,"Stay right there, dreamboat. Can't hurt you. Orders. You, on the other hand? Hurting you's encouraged."
220,DEAN,No! Uh!
220,JESSE,Leave him alone!
220,DEMON,Jesse. You're beautiful. You have your father's eyes.
220,JESSE,Who are you?
220,DEMON,I'm your mother.
220,JESSE,"No, you're not."
220,DEMON,Mm-hm. You're half human...half one of us.
220,DEAN,"She means demons, Jesse!"
220,DEMON,"Those people you call your parents—they lied to you, too. You're not theirs—not really."
220,JESSE,My mom and dad love me.
220,DEMON,"Do they? Is—is that why they leave you alone all day? Because they love you so much? These people—these imposters—they told you that the tooth fairy was real and that your toys could hurt you and a hundred other things that aren't true. They love you so much, they made your whole life a lie. Look into your heart, Jesse. You've always known you weren't theirs. You've always known you were different. Everyone has lied to you. They're not FBI agents. And you're not a superhero."
220,JESSE,Then what am I?
220,DEMON,You're powerful. You can have anything you want. You can do anything you want.
220,DEAN,"Don't listen to her, Jesse!"
220,DEMON,They treated you like a child. Nobody trusted you. Everybody's lied to you. Doesn't that make you angry?
220,DEMON,"See? It does make you angry. But I'm telling you the truth, Jesse."
220,DEMON,Wouldn't it be better if there were no lies? Come with me and you can wash it all clean. Start over. Imagine that—a world without lies.
220,SAM,She's right. We lied to you.
220,SAM,But I'll tell you the truth.
220,SAM,I just want...to tell...
220,JESSE,Stop it.
220,JESSE,I want to hear what he has to say.
220,DEMON,You're stronger than I thought.
220,SAM,"We lied to you. And I'm sorry. So here's the truth. I'm Sam Winchester. That's my brother, Dean. W-we hunt monsters."
220,DEMON,"Except when you are the monster. Right, Sammy?"
220,SAM,"And that woman right there, her name is Julia. She's your mother. But the thing inside of her, the thing that you're talking to—it's a demon."
220,JESSE,A demon?
220,DEMON,He's done nothing but lie to you since the moment you met him. Don't listen to him. Punish him.
220,JESSE,Sit down and shut up.
220,SAM,"There's, uh, kind of a...a war between angels and demons, and...you're a part of it."
220,JESSE,I'm just a kid.
220,SAM,You can go with her if you want. I can't stop you. No one can. But if you do...millions of people will die.
220,JESSE,She said I was half demon. Is that true?
220,SAM,"Yes. But you're half human, too. You can do the right thing. You've got choices, Jesse. But if you make the wrong ones, it'll haunt you for the rest of your life."
220,JESSE,Why are you telling me this?!
220,SAM,"Because I have to believe someone can make the right choice, even if I couldn't."
220,JESSE,Get out of her.
220,DEAN,How did you do that?
220,JESSE,I just did.
220,DEAN,Kid...you're awesome.
220,JESSE,Is she gonna be all right?
220,DEAN,Eventually.
220,DEAN,"Look, uh, truth is, he's kind of a buddy of mine. Is there any way you could turn him back?"
220,JESSE,He tried to kill me.
220,DEAN,Right. Uh. But he's a—he's a good guy. He was just confused.
220,DEAN,Okay. It's been a long night. We'll...talk about it later.
220,JESSE,What now?
220,DEAN,"Now we take you someplace safe, get you trained up. You'd be handy in a fight, kid."
220,JESSE,What if I don't want to fight?
220,SAM,Jesse.
220,SAM,You're powerful. More powerful than...pretty much anything we've ever seen. That makes you—
220,JESSE,A freak.
220,SAM,"To some people, maybe. But not to us. See, we're kind of freaks ourselves."
220,JESSE,"I can't stay here, can I?"
220,DEAN,"No. The demons know where you are, and more will be coming."
220,JESSE,I won't go without my mom and dad.
220,SAM,"There's nothing more important than family. We get that. And if you really want to take them with you, we'll back your play. But you got to understand—it's gonna be dangerous for them, too."
220,JESSE,What do you mean?
220,DEAN,Our dad...he would take us with him wherever he went.
220,JESSE,Where is he now?
220,SAM,Dead. A demon killed him.
220,DEAN,"Look, Jesse...once you're in this fight..."
220,DEAN,"You're in it till the end, win or lose."
220,JESSE,What should I do?
220,SAM,We can't tell you. It's your choice. It's not fair. I know.
220,JESSE,"Can I go see my parents? I, I need to...say goodbye."
220,DEAN,Sure.
220,DEAN,He's been up there a long time.
220,CASTIEL,He's gone.
220,SAM,Where?
220,CASTIEL,I don't know. Jesse put everyone in town back to normal—the ones still alive. Then he vanished.
220,SAM,Hey.
220,DEAN,What does it say?
220,SAM,"That he had to leave to keep his parents safe, that he loves them, and he's sorry."
220,DEAN,How do we find him?
220,CASTIEL,"With the boy's powers, we can't. Not unless he wants to be found."
220,DEAN,You think Jesse's gonna be okay?
220,SAM,I hope so.
220,DEAN,"You know, we destroyed that kid's life by telling him the truth."
220,SAM,"We didn't have a choice, Dean."
220,DEAN,"Yeah. You know, I'm starting to get why parents lie to their kids. You want them to believe that the worst thing out there is mixing Pop Rocks and Coke—protect them from the real evil. You want them going to bed feeling safe. If that means lying to them, so be it. The more I think about it...the more I wish Dad had lied to us."
220,SAM,"Yeah, me too."
221,DOCTOR,You expect me to believe you're CDC?
221,SAM,Excuse me?
221,DOCTOR,It's just that you're a day early. First time in history I haven't sat on my ass waiting for you people.
221,DEAN,New administration. A change you can believe in.
221,DOCTOR,Right.
221,DOCTOR,"Meet Xavier. Date of birth, April third, nineteen eighty-four."
221,DOCTOR,I know. I ran the DNA twice. That's definitely him.
221,DEAN,"Well, he wasn't big on the sunscreen, huh?"
221,SAM,"So, what's your theory?"
221,DOCTOR,"All I know is, decedent's male, twenty-five years old—"
221,DOCTOR,—and he died of old age.
221,DEAN,You were right about this one. It's definitely a job.
221,BOBBY,Thought so. Any other stiffs in town?
221,DEAN,Just the one body.
221,BOBBY,Anything else?
221,DEAN,"Couple missing persons, but usual for a town this size."
221,BOBBY,"Well, check 'em out."
221,DEAN,You think they're connected?
221,BOBBY,Call it a hunch.
221,DEAN,"You got it. And, by the way, how you doing?"
221,BOBBY,Doing?
221,DEAN,"Yeah. You know, just...in general?"
221,BOBBY,"Oh, you mean my legs. Well, I'm just weepin' in my Haagen-Dazs. Idjit."
221,SAM,How long has he been missing?
221,DEAN,"Is there someplace he likes to go after work, maybe? A favorite bar?"
221,DEAN,"May I use your facilities, ma'am?"
221,DEAN,'Working late' my ass.
221,SAM,"Well, at least he's consistent. Same room every Tuesday, hourly rates."
221,DEAN,Hope I got that kind of kick when I'm his age.
221,SAM,"Yeah, like either of us will live that long."
221,DEAN,True.
221,SAM,So...what do you think's in there?
221,DEAN,"A wrinkly, gooey corpse."
221,MAN,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh! Oh, God!"
221,MAN,Hey! What the—
221,SAM,Oh.
221,DEAN,God.
221,SAM,It's gooey.
221,DEAN,"Sorry. Uh, got the wrong room."
221,MAN,Close the door!
221,SAM,Hey.
221,SAM,Nice tattoo.
221,SAM,Happen to know anybody named Cliff Whitlow?
221,MAN,Never heard of him.
221,SAM,"Well, that's weird."
221,SAM,'Cause you're carrying his wallet.
221,DEAN,Huh.
221,DEAN,"Your wife told us about your, uh, birthmark there. That's nice. Well, you look great. Cliff. Did you get some work done?"
221,CLIFF,Could you give us some privacy?
221,CLIFF,Please don't tell my wife.
221,DEAN,Slow down.
221,CLIFF,"I'm begging you. As far as she knows, I'm dead. For the love of God, let's keep it that way."
221,DEAN,How can you possibly be Cliff Whitlow?
221,CLIFF,I can't tell you.
221,DEAN,"Well, either you tell us or we tell the missus."
221,CLIFF,Okay! Okay! It was a game.
221,SAM,Like...XBox?
221,CLIFF,"What's XBox? No. Poker. High stakes. Instead of cash, you play for years."
221,DEAN,What is that supposed to mean?
221,CLIFF,"Look, I know it sounds crazy. Guy comes up to me at a bar, invites me to play. Gives me twenty-five of these weirdo poker chips, right? Chants some mumbo humbo over them, says now they're twenty-five years. I'm laughing, but then I come out up. And look at me."
221,SAM,What was he chanting?
221,CLIFF,"How should I know? All I know is, my bad hip's good, I threw away my glasses. One of those ladies was here for free! Man's some kind of miracle worker."
221,DEAN,What does this miracle worker look like?
221,CLIFF,"Just a guy. Maybe thirty-five, brown hair. Irish accent. His name was Patrick."
221,DEAN,"All right, all right. Where's this game at?"
221,CLIFF,He said he likes to keep moving. Never stays in one bar long. And he finds you.
221,DEAN,"Thank you, Cliff."
221,DEAN,"Oh, and, uh...stay classy."
221,DEAN,"It sounds crazy, right?"
221,BOBBY,"No. There's lore on it. Goes back centuries. Traveling card player pops into town. You beat him, you get your best years back. 'Course, most folks lose."
221,DEAN,"Well, that would explain the crunchy corpse."
221,BOBBY,"Supposedly, this player's a hell of a card shark. Got a lot of years in the bank. You find the bar he's working in yet?"
221,DEAN,There's a lot of dives in this town. We're gonna have to split up.
221,BOBBY,"Well, why you still talking to me?"
221,SAM,Find anything?
221,DEAN,"Yeah, a whole bunch of squat. You?"
221,SAM,"No, not a thing."
221,DEAN,"All right. Well, you come up dry, circle back to the motel in two. Your turn to grab dinner."
221,SAM,Usual?
221,DEAN,Extra bacon.
221,DEAN,Can I get a beer?
221,BARTENDER,Yep.
221,DEAN,"You wouldn't happen to know of a poker game going on in back, would you?"
221,BARTENDER,"It's a bar, not a casino."
221,DEAN,My friend Ben told me you'd know.
221,BARTENDER,Don't know any Ben.
221,DEAN,"Sure you do. You know, balding, smart-ass, real ladies' man?"
221,BARTENDER,"Listen, pal, I told you, I don't know any Ben. I don't know nothing about a game."
221,DEAN,"You sure? 'Cause, uh..."
221,DEAN,He sure seems to know you.
221,DEAN,Bobby? What the hell are you doing here?
221,BOBBY,Planting daisies. What's it look like? Came in on the case.
221,DEAN,And you beat me here?
221,DEAN,"Well, brains trumps legs, apparently."
221,DEAN,"So, you found the game?"
221,BOBBY,Yep.
221,DEAN,Did you stop it?
221,DEAN,Bobby?
221,BOBBY,Not exactly.
221,DEAN,What did you do?
221,BOBBY,"I played, okay?"
221,DEAN,And?
221,BOBBY,I lost.
221,DEAN,Are you kidding me? You played some—some he-witch?
221,BOBBY,Don't you take that tone with me.
221,DEAN,You idiot!
221,BOBBY,They're my years! I can do what I want!
221,DEAN,How many did you lose?
221,BOBBY,Twenty-five.
221,DEAN,We're not done.
221,PATRICK,"Ah, come on. No such thing. But I can read people. Take your lovely companion here."
221,PATRICK,"I'd say, judging from her exquisite posture, she used to be a dancer."
221,PATRICK,Not much of a drinker. Very independent. Looking for adventure.
221,DEAN,"Hey, man. Excuse me. Can I borrow you for a sec?"
221,PATRICK,"Oh, yeah. Of course. Great. Good to see you."
221,PATRICK,Would you two please excuse me?
221,DEAN,Sorry to cut you short with Mr. and Mrs. Easy Marks over there.
221,PATRICK,"Oh, no big."
221,PATRICK,Wasn't a total loss.
221,PATRICK,"Look, I don't know what it is you think I did to your wife or girlfriend—"
221,PATRICK,"—mother or sister, but, uh, I just want you to know, my feelings were real."
221,DEAN,"That ain't my problem, man-witch. You owe my friend some years."
221,PATRICK,"Oh, that's what this is. I'm sorry. He lost. Them's the breaks."
221,DEAN,"Well, then un-lose him."
221,PATRICK,"Oh, go ahead and shoot me, if it makes you feel better. Besides, I could use a good...you know...tickle. You want years? Great. Play me for 'em."
221,DEAN,Fine.
221,BOBBY,"Dean, no!"
221,DEAN,They're my years. I can do what I want.
221,PATRICK,Lozenge?
221,PATRICK,"What? It's barely linty. Okay, well, suit yourself. Just trying to help."
221,DEAN,"All right, all right. Come on. Let's do this."
221,PATRICK,You understand the terms?
221,PATRICK,Buy-in's twenty-five years.
221,DEAN,Make it fifty.
221,PATRICK,I like the cut of your jib.
221,PATRICK,Lannraich gu dealrach a-nis.
221,DEAN,Twenty-five. That's twenty-five years. They go to him.
221,DEAN,And he's cashing out.
221,BOBBY,Dean!
221,DEAN,Bobby.
221,PATRICK,You sure?
221,DEAN,Yes.
221,PATRICK,Las suas agus cuir ás an teine. Mar sin bitheadh.
221,PATRICK,That's twenty-five years you just pissed away. Better be sure you can win them back.
221,DEAN,Shuffle up and deal.
221,PATRICK,This is gonna be fun.
221,SAM,"Hey, Dean? You find anything?"
221,SAM,Who the hell are you!
221,SAM,Dean?
221,DEAN,Hi.
221,SAM,What the hell happened?
221,DEAN,"I, you know...found the game."
221,SAM,You f—I thought you said you were g-good at poker.
221,DEAN,"I am. Shut up. So, you were just gonna shoot some old guy? Is that it?"
221,SAM,"I didn't know what you were. I mean, have you seen you? You look like—"
221,SAM,I was gonna say Emperor Palpatine.
221,BOBBY,I see you met John McCain there.
221,SAM,Yeah. Either of you want to tell me what happened?
221,DEAN,Bobby's an idiot. That's what happened.
221,BOBBY,"Hey, nobody asked you to play."
221,DEAN,Right. I should have just let you die.
221,BOBBY,"And for damn sure, nobody asked you to lose!"
221,DEAN,What the hell were you thinking? He's a witch. He's been playing poker since guys wore tights.
221,BOBBY,You just don't get it.
221,DEAN,"Yeah, I get it, Bobby. You saw a chance to turn the hands of the clock back and get out of that damn chair. Pretty tempting. I can imagine."
221,BOBBY,"No, you can't."
221,DEAN,"You got me. I never been paralyzed. But I tell you something—I've been to hell, and there's an archangel there wanting me to drop the soap. Look at me! My junk's rustier than yours! You hear me bellyaching? Huh?"
221,SAM,"Uh, actually, yeah."
221,DEAN,Oh!
221,DEAN,I'm having a heart attack.
221,BOBBY,"No, you're not."
221,DEAN,What is it?
221,BOBBY,Acid reflux. Guys your age can't digest certain foods. You're gonna need to put down that cheeseburger.
221,BOBBY,"So, you want to keep emoting, or you want to talk about solving this little issue of yours? It's got to be about the chips."
221,DEAN,"I slid 'em across, Patrick did his little witchy number, and you prettied up in a hurry."
221,SAM,"I mean, what are you all thinking? Some kind of magic chips or something?"
221,BOBBY,Definitely.
221,DEAN,You remember what he chanted?
221,BOBBY,Yep—every word.
221,SAM,"All right, then let's find out where he stashes his chips."
221,DEAN,And steal me fifty. Benjamin Button me back into burger shape. What do you think?
221,BOBBY,I think you ought to put some clothes on.
221,MAID,"Ready for housekeeping, sir?"
221,DEAN,Born ready.
221,MAID,You're just like my grandfather.
221,MAID,"He hits on anything that moves, too."
221,MAID,You're adorable.
221,DEAN,And dangerous.
221,MAID,Aw.
221,DEAN,Can we just go?
221,DRIVER,"Guys, get some help! He came out of nowhere! Right out in front of me!"
221,DEAN,"I got to say, I kind of like the guy."
221,BOBBY,"Well, I'm out."
221,SAM,Dean.
221,DEAN,Sam?
221,DEAN,Dime-store model. Piece of cake.
221,DEAN,I could have done that.
221,LIA,What are you doing?
221,DEAN,Aren't you the chick from the bar?
221,LIA,I'm a lot more than that.
221,PATRICK,"It's all right, sweetheart. It's all right. They're harmless."
221,PATRICK,"You boys want chips? Take 'em. They're just chips, Einsteins. It's showmanship. This may come as a shock, but the magic does not lie in a pile of crappy plywood or in any phony abracadabra. It's in the nine-hundred-year-old witch. You boys want years? Score 'em the old-fashioned way. Texas hold 'em."
221,DEAN,Fine. Let's do it.
221,PATRICK,What card am I holding up?
221,PATRICK,"That's what I thought. If your eyesight's that bad, what about your memory? I'm not a murderer. You, on the other hand..."
221,DEAN,"No, Sam."
221,SAM,Dean.
221,PATRICK,"What, Sam not much of a player? Okay, well, happy trails, Dean. Enjoy the twilight of your life. Should have taken better care of that ticker, though."
221,PATRICK,You're free to go.
221,PATRICK,"Oh, but, Sam..."
221,PATRICK,"Your brother's situation—that's punishment enough, but I can't let you leave without a small parting gift."
221,SAM,What are you doing?
221,PATRICK,You'll find out soon enough.
221,DEAN,"Let's get out of here, Sam."
221,DEAN,Dude...
221,DEAN,I believe that he-witch gave you the clap.
221,BOBBY,Little help here?
221,SAM,"You know, I still think I should play."
221,DEAN,"No, no, no. You're not good enough. I'm better. Bobby's way better. We both lost."
221,BOBBY,Exactly.
221,SAM,"So, what? So I don't get a say in this anymore?"
221,DEAN,"Sammy, when you get to be our age—"
221,SAM,"You're thirty, Dean! Look, I've watched you hustle plenty of poker—"
221,BOBBY,"Knowing the game is not enough, Sam. It's not about playing the cards."
221,SAM,It's about playing the other guy. I know that.
221,BOBBY,"Well, hooray for you. All I'm saying is, I played this guy. I know his style. I can take him."
221,DEAN,"No, Bobby. You don't have enough years in the bank."
221,BOBBY,I got enough.
221,SAM,"No, you'll die if you lose, Bobby."
221,BOBBY,"So what if I do, huh? What exactly am I living for, huh? The damn apocalypse? Watching men die bloody while I sit in this chair, can't take a step to help 'em?"
221,DEAN,Bobby—
221,BOBBY,"No, no. It's the facts. I'm old...and broke down...and I can't..."
221,BOBBY,"I ain't a hunter no more. I'm useless. And if I wasn't such a coward, I'd have stuck a gun in my mouth day I got home from the hospital."
221,SAM,"Bobby, you are not playing again. I'm not letting you do that. There's another way out of this. There's got to be. And I'm gonna find it."
221,LIA,Take it. It'll help you.
221,BOBBY,What is this?
221,LIA,The most powerful reversal spell you've ever laid your eyes on.
221,DEAN,And it reverses what?
221,LIA,Patrick's work—all of it.
221,DEAN,You—you saying I could be normal again?
221,LIA,You and everyone else he's ever played.
221,LIA,Who's still alive.
221,DEAN,Why the hell should we trust you?
221,LIA,"Trust me, don't trust me. I don't care. The spell is real."
221,BOBBY,"If it zaps everyone, don't that include your man?"
221,LIA,"And me, too. I look good for my age."
221,BOBBY,"Lady, this don't add up for squat. Why would you want that?"
221,LIA,I have my reasons.
221,LIA,Do it quick. We leave town tomorrow.
221,HESH,Bet.
221,PATRICK,"I sense you've got me by the jewels on this one, Hesh. I fold."
221,PATRICK,"What are you up—like thirteen years there, Hesh? What do you say we call it a day?"
221,HESH,"Thanks, Patrick."
221,PATRICK,"Hesh here is gonna live to see his granddaughter's bat mitzvah. Isn't that right, Hesh?"
221,HESH,"Thanks again, Patrick."
221,PATRICK,"Shalom, my friend. Shalom."
221,SAM,That was nice of you.
221,PATRICK,I'm a nice guy. What can I do you for?
221,SAM,Deal.
221,DEAN,Jawbone of a murderer. Great.
221,DEAN,"You know, this really sucks. How do we even know her spell's gonna work?"
221,BOBBY,"We don't. But we ain't got a Plan B. Now, less flappin' and more diggin'."
221,DEAN,"Oh, God!"
221,DEAN,My elbows! I'm all creaky.
221,BOBBY,"Hurry up, you crybaby."
221,DEAN,"Pound it up your ass, Ironsides."
221,BOBBY,One little grave.
221,DEAN,Then you do it.
221,BOBBY,Fine. I'll hop right in.
221,DEAN,"Well, least your legs are numb."
221,BOBBY,"Shut up and dig, Grandma."
221,DEAN,Oh! Now it's my back!
221,BOBBY,Can you straighten up?
221,DEAN,"Yeah, but a little sympathy wouldn't hurt."
221,BOBBY,Butt cheek tingling?
221,DEAN,"Well, that's kind of personal."
221,BOBBY,So yeah?
221,BOBBY,It's sciatica. You'll live. Keep digging.
221,DEAN,"You know, Bobby, killing you is officially on my bucket list."
221,PATRICK,"I like you, Sam. I do. You're smart, and your heart's clearly in the right place."
221,PATRICK,I can tell a lot about a guy by looking.
221,SAM,You mean you're psychic.
221,PATRICK,No. That'd be cheating. I'm talking about good old-fashioned intuition.
221,SAM,Right. Let's just play.
221,PATRICK,We are playing.
221,PATRICK,Does your big brother know you're here?
221,SAM,Bet five.
221,PATRICK,Didn't think so.
221,PATRICK,"I raise. Here you are, right? Trying to clean up their mess, and they still want to sit you at the kiddie table."
221,PATRICK,"You're not the little brother anymore, Sam."
221,PATRICK,"Then again, maybe you are. You're in over your head here, Sam. I mean, you can keep making these moves—you know, playing it cautious, playing the percentages. But I'm still gonna kick your ass into the nursing home."
221,SAM,Does this armchair-psychology routine usually work for you?
221,PATRICK,You tell me. You're the one who's losing.
221,PATRICK,Little break?
221,DEAN,How's it going in there?
221,SAM,How do you think it's going? What about you? You have everything you need?
221,DEAN,We still need a little he-witch DNA.
221,SAM,He was chewing it.
221,SAM,"Hurry up, Dean. Please."
221,DEAN,"All right. Just keep him busy. And, Sammy...don't lose."
221,BOBBY,"—na hogalachd. Gairmidh mi air sucellus, dia na time."
221,BOBBY,Till an-dràsda obair uile gu bheilair a bhith deànta. Mar sin bitheadh. Drop it in.
221,DEAN,Well? How do I look?
221,PATRICK.,Question.
221,PATRICK,Is this what you meant to give your big brother?
221,PATRICK,The one you gave him never passed my lips. Won't do a scrap of good.
221,PATRICK,"I don't like cheating, Sam."
221,LIA,Stop it!
221,LIA,"Patrick, let him go!"
221,PATRICK,He tried to kill us!
221,LIA,I did it! I gave him the spell!
221,PATRICK,What?
221,PATRICK,Why...why would you do that?
221,LIA,You know why.
221,LIA,You know.
221,PATRICK,Keep. Playing.
221,BOBBY,Everything we put in that spell was kosher.
221,DEAN,"Yeah, everything except the damn toothpick."
221,BOBBY,You got to go get a speck of DNA. Strap on your track shoes.
221,DEAN,"Oh, goody. More stairs."
221,DEAN,It's too damn clean in here. First witch I ever heard of didn't spew bodily fluids all over the place.
221,BOBBY,"Toothbrush, comb—anything."
221,PATRICK,"Well, look at you—the percentage player betting the farm. Awful transparent of you, Sam. I mean, if I had a monster hand like you have, I'd trap you. But you get so excited, you bet yourself right out of a big pot."
221,PATRICK,I fold.
221,PATRICK,"Set of ladies, I'm guessing."
221,PATRICK,"Nice bluff. If we had time, I could make a real player out of you."
221,SAM,I got time.
221,PATRICK,Maybe. But I can't say the same for Dean. Your brother's gonna be dead soon.
221,PATRICK,And when I say 'soon'...
221,PATRICK,I mean minutes.
221,PATRICK,The game's not over till I say it is. Blinds.
221,DEAN,Sam...
221,PATRICK,So.
221,PATRICK,"When it's about your brother, you get so emotional, your brain just flies right out the window."
221,PATRICK,Good to know.
221,SAM,Go to hell.
221,SAM,I'm all in.
221,PATRICK,"Don't do that, Sam."
221,SAM,"I can't leave until it's over? Fine. It's over. Now, where's my brother?"
221,PATRICK,"Look, there's poker and then there's suicide."
221,SAM,Just play the hand.
221,BOBBY,"Dean? Dean, you there?"
221,PATRICK,Fine.
221,BOBBY,Dean?!
221,PATRICK,"I'm sorry, kid. Aces full."
221,SAM,You're crying.
221,SAM,"For a witch, you're so nice, it's actually kind of creepy. It's okay."
221,SAM,It was a great hand.
221,SAM,Just—
221,SAM,—not as great as—
221,SAM,—as four fours.
221,PATRICK,"Well played. You know, that whole...going-out-of-your-head bit—very method."
221,PATRICK,"Well, there's more to you than meets the eye."
221,SAM,"Cash these in for Dean, please."
221,PATRICK,With pleasure.
221,BOBBY,"Dean, you hear me? Damn it, Dean!"
221,BOBBY,Idjit.
221,PATRICK,"I can't do this, Lia."
221,LIA,"Yes, you can."
221,PATRICK,Don't make me. I don't want to win.
221,LIA,I buried my daughter.
221,LIA,And she looked like this.
221,LIA,It's not natural.
221,PATRICK,You knew. When you decided to come with me.
221,PATRICK,This is what you wanted. You're still young. You're so beautiful. You have me.
221,LIA,"I miss my family. I'm sorry, Patrick."
221,PATRICK,I thought you loved me.
221,LIA,"I do. Sweetheart, of course I do. I thought I was cut out for this, but I'm not."
221,PATRICK,I don't think I can do this without you.
221,LIA,You got on okay for a long time before you met me.
221,PATRICK,Check.
221,LIA,All in.
221,PATRICK,All in.
221,LIA,Thank you.
221,BOBBY,No tricks—you actually beat the guy?
221,BOBBY,How the hell?
221,SAM,Just lucky.
221,SAM,Hey. I'll see y'all guys later.
221,DEAN,Where you going?
221,SAM,"Uh...mm, nowhere."
221,SAM,A booster shot. Don't say it.
221,BOBBY,"Well, I guess we can get the van loaded."
221,DEAN,I shouldn't have called you an idiot.
221,BOBBY,Which time?
221,DEAN,"I'm sorry. I mean, I actually—I, I—I get it. Getting old ain't a bachelor party. And dealing with the crap you got to deal with—"
221,BOBBY,Don't you go on pity patrol.
221,DEAN,"I'm not. I'm not. I'm just...I'm saying, you know, if I was in your shoes..."
221,BOBBY,You'd never stop complaining.
221,DEAN,"Fair enough. You're not useless, Bobby."
221,BOBBY,Okay. Good talk.
221,DEAN,"No, wait a minute. Listen to me."
221,DEAN,"You don't stop being a soldier 'cause you got wounded in battle. Okay? No matter what shape you're in, bottom line is, you're family. I don't know if you've noticed, but me and Sam, we don't have much left. I can't do this without you. I can't. So don't you dare think about checking out. I don't want to hear that again."
221,BOBBY,Okay.
221,DEAN,Okay. Good.
221,BOBBY,"Thanks. Now, we done feeling our feelings? 'Cause I'd like to get out of this room before we both start growing lady parts."
221,DEAN,"Yeah, we're done."
221,DEAN,"Let's go, Ironsides."
221,BOBBY,"Oh, that one's sticking, huh?"
222,DEAN,You sons of bitches jumpstarted Judgment Day!
222,ZACHARIAH,It's Apocalypse Now.
222,CASTIEL,Raphael. Where is he?
222,RAPHAEL,"God? He's dead, Castiel."
222,SAM,Lucifer.
222,LUCIFER,"You're the one, Sam. You're my true vessel."
222,SAM,That'll never happen.
222,ZACHARIAH,You're the Michael sword.
222,DEAN,"What do you mean, I'm the sword?"
222,ZACHARIAH,You're Michael's weapon.
222,DEAN,I'm a vessel?
222,DEAN,So what is it? Spirit? Demon?
222,BOBBY,More like demigods.
222,BOBBY,—usually with a sense of humor. Deadly pranks.
222,DEAN,"Okay, another thing Bobby mentioned was—"
222,TRICKSTER,"Sam, there's a lesson here."
222,SAM,What lesson?
222,TRICKSTER,"Dean's your weakness. The bad guys know it, too. It's gonna be the death of you, Sam."
222,DEAN,I'm gonna need a bigger mouth.
222,DEAN,"Hey there, Sam. What's happening?"
222,SAM,"Oh, nothing. Um. Just the end of the world."
222,SAM,You're gonna need a bigger mouth.
222,SAM,"Hey, uh, have you done your research yet?"
222,DEAN,"Oh, yeah. All kinds of research. All night."
222,SAM,Yeah? Hm.
222,WOMAN,"Oh, Dean..."
222,DEAN,We have some more research to do.
222,SAM,Dean...
222,DEAN,Son of a bitch!
222,INTERCOM,All on-duty interns please report to station five south. All on-duty interns please report to station five south.
222,SAM,What are you watching?
222,SAM,When did you hit menopause?
222,DEAN,It's called channel surfing.
222,DEAN,You ready?
222,SAM,Are you?
222,OFFICER,"One more time, the FBI is here why, exactly?"
222,DEAN,Might have something to do with one of your locals getting his head ripped off.
222,OFFICER,Bill Randolph died from a bear attack.
222,SAM,How sure are you—
222,SAM,—that it was a bear?
222,OFFICER,What else would it be?
222,DEAN,"Well, whatever it was—"
222,DEAN,"—it chased Mr. Randolph through the woods, smashed through his front door—"
222,DEAN,"—followed him up the stairs, and killed him in his bedroom."
222,DEAN,"Is that common, a bear doing all that?"
222,OFFICER,"Depends how pissed off it is, I guess. Look, the Randolphs live way up in high country. You got trout runs to make a grown man weep."
222,OFFICER,And bears.
222,SAM,"Right. Now, what about Mrs. Randolph? The file says she saw the whole thing."
222,OFFICER,"Yes, she did."
222,OFFICER,My heart goes out to that poor woman.
222,DEAN,She said bear.
222,OFFICER,Kathy Randolph went through a hell of a trauma. She's confused.
222,SAM,What did she say?
222,KATHY,"No, it must have been a bear."
222,KATHY,"I mean, what else could it have been?"
222,SAM,"Mrs. Randolph, what do you think it was?"
222,KATHY,"No, I, I remember clearly now."
222,KATHY,It was definitely a bear.
222,DEAN,"We're sure it was. But see, it helps us to hear every angle. So just tell us what you thought you saw."
222,KATHY,"It's impossible, but...I could have sworn I saw...the Incredible Hulk."
222,SAM,The Incredible Hulk.
222,KATHY,I told you it was crazy.
222,DEAN,Bana or Norton?
222,KATHY,"Oh, no, those movies were terrible. The TV Hulk."
222,DEAN,Lou Ferrigno.
222,KATHY,Yes.
222,DEAN,Spiky-hair Lou Ferrigno.
222,KATHY,Yes.
222,DEAN,Huh.
222,KATHY,You think I'm crazy.
222,DEAN,"No. Uh, no, it's just...is there, uh, would there be any reason that Lou Ferrigno, the Incredible Hulk, would have a grudge against your husband?"
222,KATHY,No.
222,DEAN,No.
222,SAM,Hey.
222,DEAN,Find anything?
222,SAM,"Well, uh, I saw the house."
222,DEAN,And?
222,SAM,"And there is a giant eight-foot-wide hole where the front door used to be. Almost like, uh—"
222,DEAN,A Hulk-sized hole.
222,SAM,Maybe. What do you got?
222,DEAN,"Well, it turns out that Bill Randolph had quite the temper. He's got two counts of spousal battery, bar brawls, and court-ordered anger management sessions. You might say you wouldn't like him when he's angry."
222,SAM,"So a hothead getting killed by TV's greatest hothead. Kinda sounds like just desserts, doesn't it?"
222,SAM,It's all starting to make sense.
222,DEAN,How is it starting to make sense?
222,SAM,"Well, I found something else at the crime scene."
222,SAM,Candy wrappers.
222,SAM,Lots of them.
222,DEAN,"Just desserts, sweet tooth, screwing with people before you kill 'em—we're dealing with the Trickster, aren't we?"
222,SAM,Sure looks like it.
222,DEAN,Good. I've wanted to gank that mother since Mystery Spot.
222,SAM,You sure?
222,DEAN,Yeah I'm sure.
222,SAM,"No, I mean are you sure you wanna kill him?"
222,DEAN,Son of a bitch didn't think twice about icing me a thousand times.
222,SAM,"No, I know, I mean, I'm just saying—"
222,DEAN,"What are you saying? If you don't want to kill him, then what?"
222,SAM,Talk to him?
222,DEAN,What?
222,SAM,"Think about it, Dean. He's one of the most powerful creatures we've ever met. Maybe we can use him."
222,DEAN,For what?
222,SAM,"Okay, Trickster's like a Hugh Hefner type, right? Wine, women, song—maybe he doesn't want the party to end. Maybe he hates this angels and demons stuff as much as we do. Maybe he'll help us."
222,DEAN,You're serious.
222,SAM,Yeah.
222,DEAN,Ally with the Trickster.
222,SAM,Yeah.
222,DEAN,"A bloody, violent monster, and you wanna be Facebook friends with him? Nice, Sammy."
222,SAM,"The world is gonna end, Dean. We don't have the luxury of a moral stand. Look, I'm just saying it's worth a shot. That's all. If it doesn't work, we'll kill him."
222,DEAN,"How are we gonna find the guy, anyway?"
222,SAM,"Well, he never takes just one victim, right? He'll show."
222,SCANNER,"Um, Dispatch? I, I got a possible 187 out here at the old paper mill on Route 6?"
222,SAM,Hey.
222,DISPATCH,"Roger that. What are you looking at there, son?"
222,SCANNER,"Honestly, Walt, I, I wouldn't even know how to describe what I'm seeing. Just—send everybody."
222,DISPATCH,"All right, stay calm, stay by your car. Help's on the way."
222,DEAN,That sounds weird.
222,SAM,Weird enough to be our guy.
222,DEAN,"There was a murder here, and there's no police cars. There's nobody. How's that look to you?"
222,SAM,Crappy.
222,DEAN,What the hell?
222,SAM,Doctor?
222,SAM,Ow!
222,SAM,What?
222,SAM,Um. What are you talking about?
222,DEAN,I don't believe this.
222,SAM,What?
222,DEAN,That's Dr. Piccolo.
222,SAM,Who?
222,DEAN,Dr. Ellen Piccolo.
222,DEAN,The sexy yet earnest doctor at—
222,DEAN,Seattle Mercy Hospital.
222,SAM,Dean.
222,SAM,What the hell are you talking about?
222,DEAN,"The doctor getups. The, the sexy interns. The 'seriously's. It all makes sense."
222,SAM,What makes sense? What's going on?
222,DEAN,"Dude, what the hell."
222,SAM,I don't know.
222,DEAN,"No, seriously, what the hell."
222,SAM,I don't know.
222,DEAN,One theory. Any theory.
222,SAM,"Uh, the Trickster trapped us in TV Land."
222,DEAN,That's your theory. That's stupid.
222,DEAN,"Yeah, but TV land isn't TV Land. I mean, there's actors and, and lights and crew members, you know. This looks real."
222,SAM,"It can't be. Dean, how can this possibly be real?"
222,DEAN,I don't know.
222,DEAN,There goes Dr. Wang. The sexy but arrogant heart surgeon.
222,DEAN,"And there's Johnny Drake. Oh, he's not even alive, he's a ghost in the mind of—"
222,DEAN,Of her. The sexy yet neurotic doctor over there.
222,SAM,So...this show has ghosts? Why?
222,DEAN,I don't know. It is compelling.
222,SAM,I thought you said you weren't a fan.
222,DEAN,I'm not. I'm not.
222,DEAN,Oh boy.
222,SAM,What?
222,DEAN,It's him.
222,SAM,Who?
222,DEAN,"It's him, it's Dr. Sexy."
222,DEAN,Doctor.
222,SAM,Doctor.
222,DEAN,One reason?
222,DEAN,Sure.
222,DEAN,You're not Dr. Sexy.
222,DEAN,Really? Because I swore part of what makes Dr. Sexy sexy is the fact that he wears cowboy boots. Not tennis shoes.
222,SAM,Yeah. You're not a fan.
222,DEAN,It's a guilty pleasure.
222,DEAN,"Yeah, go ahead, pal. See, we know who you are."
222,TRICKSTER,You guys are getting better!
222,DEAN,Get us the hell out of here.
222,TRICKSTER,Or what?
222,TRICKSTER,"Don't say you have wooden stakes, big guy."
222,SAM,"That was you on the police scanner, right? This is a trick."
222,TRICKSTER,Hello? Trickster. Come on! I heard you two yahoos were in town. How could I resist?
222,DEAN,Where the hell are we?
222,TRICKSTER,Like it? It's all homemade. My own sets—
222,TRICKSTER,My own actors...call it my own little idiot box.
222,DEAN,How do we get out?
222,TRICKSTER,"That, my friend, is the sixty-four-dollar question."
222,SAM,"Whatever. We just, we need to talk to you. We need your help."
222,TRICKSTER,"Hm, let me guess. You two muttonheads broke the world, and you want me to sweep up your mess."
222,SAM,Please. Just five minutes. Hear us out.
222,TRICKSTER,"Sure. Tell you what. Survive the next twenty-four hours, we'll talk."
222,DEAN,Survive what?
222,TRICKSTER,The game!
222,DEAN,What game?
222,TRICKSTER,You're in it.
222,DEAN,How do we play?
222,TRICKSTER,You're playing it.
222,DEAN,What are the rules?
222,DEAN,"Oh, son of a bitch."
222,INTERCOM,Paging Dr. Sexy. Report to the ER.
222,DEAN,"Oh, by the way. Talking with monsters? Hell of a plan."
222,SAM,"Just, what do we do now?"
222,DEAN,You know what I'm doing? Leaving.
222,SAM,"Lady, what the hell?"
222,SAM,Yeah. A coward. You already said that. But I got news for you. I am not a doctor.
222,SAM,I have no idea what you're saying to me.
222,SAM,"Yeah, we're getting out of here."
222,MAN,Hey. Doctor.
222,DEAN,Yeah.
222,MAN,My wife needs that face transplant.
222,DEAN,"Okay. You know what, pal? None of this is real, and your wife doesn't need jack squat. Okay?"
222,DEAN,Real—it's real—
222,SAM,"No no no, no no no no no—hey! We need a doctor!"
222,SAM,What?
222,DEAN,Sam. Do something. Come on.
222,SAM,I don't know how to use any of this crap.
222,DEAN,Figure it out.
222,DEAN,Sam. Come on. I'm waiting.
222,SAM,"Okay. Um. I need a penknife, some dental floss, a sewing needle, and a fifth of whiskey."
222,SAM,Stat!
222,DEAN,We okay? How's it looking?
222,SAM,Yep. You'll be fine.
222,HOST,Let's play Nutcracker!
222,HOST,Sam Winchester.
222,HOST,Countdown.
222,SAM,What?
222,SAM,"Uh, what am I supposed to say?"
222,DEAN,You think I know?
222,SAM,"Uh, I, I don't, I don't understand Japanese."
222,SAM,"Is he screwing with me? I, I, I can't speak Japanese."
222,HOST,Ruby!
222,HOST,"I'm sorry, Sam Winchester."
222,SAM,Sorry? Sir? For what?
222,SAM,Dean?
222,HOST,Nutcracker!
222,HOST,Nutcracker!
222,DEAN,Sam?
222,DEAN,You okay?
222,DEAN,Oh now what?
222,DEAN,Cas?
222,SAM,Is this another trick?
222,CASTIEL,"It's me. Uh, what are you doing here?"
222,DEAN,Us? What are you doing here?
222,CASTIEL,Looking for you. You've been missing for days.
222,SAM,"So get us the hell out of here, then!"
222,CASTIEL,Let's go.
222,DEAN,Cas?
222,HOST,"No, no, no, no. Mr. Trickster does not like pretty-boy angels."
222,HOST,Dean Winchester.
222,HOST,Countdown.
222,DEAN,"What do I do, what do I do?"
222,SAM,What?
222,DEAN,I don't wanna get hit in the nuts.
222,SAM,"I don't know, I, I, uh, just, uh—wait."
222,DEAN,What?
222,SAM,I played a doctor.
222,DEAN,What?
222,DEAN,So?
222,SAM,So I played the role the Trickster wanted me to play. Maybe we should just go along with it.
222,DEAN,Go along with what?
222,SAM,"With the game! You know, we're on a game show, right? So just answer the question!"
222,DEAN,In Japanese?
222,SAM,Yeah!
222,DEAN,I don't know Japanese!
222,SAM,Try!
222,DEAN,Dammit!
222,HOST,"Dean Winchester, Nutcracker champion!"
222,SAM,How did you do that?
222,DEAN,I have no idea.
222,SAM,"So that's it. We play our roles, we survive."
222,DEAN,"Yeah, but play our roles for how long?"
222,SAM,Good question.
222,WOMAN,I've got genital herpes.
222,SAM,Seriously?
222,DEAN,"Hey, you're the one who said play our roles."
222,SAM,Yeah. Right.
222,SAM,I've got genital herpes.
222,WOMAN,I try to be responsible.
222,SAM,But now I take twice-daily Herpexia to reduce my chances of passing it on.
222,WOMAN,Ask your doctor about using Herpexia.
222,SAM,I am doing all I can to slightly lessen the spread of—of genital herpes. And that's a good thing.
222,DEAN,Son of a bitch!
222,SAM,"Uh, I am really, really, very sorry, but, uh, we've got some work to do."
222,WOMAN,But we did do work! In depth.
222,DEAN,How long do we have to keep doing this?
222,SAM,I don't know.
222,SAM,Maybe forever?
222,SAM,We might die in here.
222,DEAN,How was that funny? Vultures.
222,DEAN,You okay?
222,CASTIEL,I don't have much time.
222,SAM,What happened?
222,CASTIEL,I got out.
222,DEAN,From where?
222,CASTIEL,Listen to me. Something is not right. This thing is much more powerful than it should be.
222,DEAN,What thing—the Trickster?
222,CASTIEL,If it is a trickster.
222,SAM,What do you mean?
222,TRICKSTER,Hello!
222,TRICKSTER,"Thank you. Thank you, ladies."
222,TRICKSTER,"Hi, Castiel!"
222,SAM,You know him?
222,DEAN,Where did you just send him?
222,TRICKSTER,"Relax, he'll live. ...Maybe."
222,DEAN,"All right, you know what? I am done with the monkey dance, okay? We get it."
222,TRICKSTER,"Yeah? Get what, hotshot?"
222,DEAN,"Playing our roles, right? That's your game?"
222,TRICKSTER,That's half the game.
222,SAM,What's the other half?
222,TRICKSTER,Play your roles out there.
222,DEAN,What's that supposed to mean?
222,TRICKSTER,"Oh, you know. Sam starring as Lucifer. Dean starring as Michael. Your celebrity death match. Play your roles."
222,SAM,You want us to say yes to those sons of bitches?
222,TRICKSTER,Hells yeah. Let's light this candle!
222,SAM,"We do that, the world will end."
222,TRICKSTER,"Yeah? And whose fault is that? Who popped Lucifer out of the box? Hm? Look, it's started. You started it. It can't be stopped. So let's get it over with!"
222,DEAN,"Heaven or hell, which side you on?"
222,TRICKSTER,I'm not on either side.
222,DEAN,"Yeah, right. You're grabbing ankle for Michael or Lucifer. Which one is it?"
222,TRICKSTER,"You listen to me, you arrogant dick. I don't work for either of those S.O.B.s. Believe me."
222,DEAN,"Oh, you're somebody's bitch."
222,TRICKSTER,"Don't you ever, ever presume to know what I am. Now listen very closely. Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna suck it up, accept your responsibilities, and play the roles that destiny has chosen for you."
222,SAM,And if we don't?
222,TRICKSTER,"Then you'll stay here in TV Land. Forever. Three hundred channels and, uh, nothing's on."
222,DEAN,"Oh, come on."
222,OFFICER,"So, what do you think?"
222,DEAN,"What do I think? I think go screw yourself, that's what I think."
222,SAM,"Uh, could you give us a sec, please? Thanks."
222,SAM,You gotta calm down.
222,DEAN,Calm down? I am wearing sunglasses at night.
222,DEAN,You know who does that? No-talent douchebags.
222,DEAN,"I hate this game. I hate that we're in a procedural cop show and you wanna know why? Because I hate procedural cop shows. There's like three hundred of them on television and they're all the freaking same. It's ooh, plane crashed here—oh shut up."
222,SAM,Hey.
222,DEAN,What?
222,SAM,Check out sweet tooth over there.
222,DEAN,Think that's him?
222,SAM,"Just, um, follow my lead."
222,OFFICER,"You, uh, you okay?"
222,DEAN,Yeah. What do we got?
222,OFFICER,"Well, aside from the ligature marks around his neck, he has what appears to be a roll of quarters jammed down his throat."
222,SAM,"Well I say, jackpot."
222,OFFICER,"Also, there is a stab wound to the lower abdomen."
222,DEAN,"Well I say, no guts, no glory."
222,SAM,Get that guy a Tums.
222,DEAN,Gutter ball.
222,OFFICER,"Good one, guys."
222,TRICKSTER,"You've got the wrong guy, idiots."
222,DEAN,Did we?
222,DEAN,"I'm worried, man. What that SOB did to Cas. You know, where is he?"
222,DEAN,Sam?
222,DEAN,Where are you?
222,DEAN,Sam. It's me. Where the hell did you go?
222,SAM,Dean?
222,DEAN,Sam? Where are you?
222,SAM,I don't know.
222,SAM,Oh crap. I don't think we killed the Trickster.
222,DEAN,"Okay, stake didn't work. So, what, this is another trick?"
222,SAM,I don't know. Maybe the stake didn't work because it's not a trickster?
222,DEAN,What do you mean?
222,SAM,You heard Cas. He said this thing was too powerful to be a trickster.
222,DEAN,And did you notice the way he looked at Cas? Almost like he knew him.
222,SAM,And how pissed he got when you brought up Michael and Lucifer.
222,DEAN,Son of a bitch.
222,SAM,What?
222,DEAN,I think I know what we're dealing with.
222,SAM,Dean?
222,DEAN,What?
222,SAM,"That, uh, feels really uncomfortable."
222,SAM,Ow. You sure this is gonna work?
222,DEAN,"No, but I have no other ideas."
222,DEAN,"All right, you son of a bitch! Uncle! We'll do it!"
222,SAM,Should I honk?
222,SAM,Eat me.
222,TRICKSTER,"Okay, boys. Ready to go quietly?"
222,DEAN,"Whoa whoa whoa, not so fast. Nobody's going anywhere until Sam has opposable thumbs."
222,TRICKSTER,What's the difference? Satan's going to ride his ass one way or another.
222,TRICKSTER,Happy?
222,DEAN,Tell me one thing. Why didn't the stake kill you?
222,TRICKSTER,I am the Trickster.
222,DEAN,Or maybe you're not.
222,DEAN,Maybe you've always been an angel.
222,TRICKSTER,"A what? Somebody slip a mickey in your power shake, kid?"
222,DEAN,I'll tell you what. You just jump out of the holy fire and we'll call it our mistake.
222,TRICKSTER,"Well played, boys. Well played. Where'd you get the holy oil?"
222,DEAN,"Well, you might say we pulled it out of Sam's ass."
222,TRICKSTER,Where'd I screw up?
222,SAM,You didn't. Nobody gets the jump on Cas like you did.
222,DEAN,Mostly it was the way you talked about Armageddon.
222,TRICKSTER,Meaning?
222,DEAN,"Well, call it personal experience, but nobody gets that angry unless they're talking about their own family."
222,SAM,"So which one are you? Grumpy, Sneezy, or Douchey?"
222,TRICKSTER,"Gabriel, okay? They call me Gabriel."
222,SAM,Gabriel? The archangel?
222,GABRIEL,Guilty.
222,DEAN,"Okay, Gabriel. How does an archangel become a trickster?"
222,GABRIEL,"My own private witness protection. I skipped out of heaven, had a face transplant, carved out my own little corner of the world. Till you two screwed it all up."
222,DEAN,What did Daddy say when you ran off and joined the pagans?
222,GABRIEL,Daddy doesn't say anything about anything.
222,SAM,Then what happened? Why'd you ditch?
222,DEAN,"Do you blame him? I mean, his brothers are heavyweight douchenozzles."
222,GABRIEL,"Shut your cakehole. You don't know anything about my family. I love my father, my brothers. Love them. But watching them turn on each other? Tear at each other's throats? I couldn't bear it! Okay? So I left. And now it's happening all over again."
222,SAM,Then help us stop it.
222,GABRIEL,It can't be stopped.
222,DEAN,You wanna see the end of the world?
222,GABRIEL,"I want it to be over! I have to sit back and watch my own brothers kill each other thanks to you two! Heaven, hell, I don't care who wins, I just want it to be over."
222,SAM,"It doesn't have to be like that. There has to be some way to, to pull the plug."
222,GABRIEL,"You do not know my family. What you guys call the apocalypse, I used to call Sunday dinner. That's why there's no stopping this, because this isn't about a war. It's about two brothers that loved each other and betrayed each other. You'd think you'd be able to relate."
222,SAM,What are you talking about?
222,GABRIEL,"You sorry sons of bitches. Why do you think you two are the vessels? Think about it. Michael, the big brother, loyal to an absent father, and Lucifer, the little brother, rebellious of Daddy's plan. You were born to this, boys. It's your destiny! It was always you! As it is in heaven, so it must be on earth. One brother has to kill the other."
222,DEAN,What the hell are you saying?
222,GABRIEL,"Why do you think I've always taken such an interest in you? Because from the moment Dad flipped on the lights around here, we knew it was all gonna end with you. Always."
222,DEAN,No. That's not gonna happen.
222,GABRIEL,I'm sorry. But it is.
222,GABRIEL,"Guys. I wish this were a TV show. Easy answers, endings wrapped up in a bow...but this is real, and it's gonna end bloody for all of us. That's just how it's gotta be."
222,GABRIEL,So. Boys. Now what? We stare at each other for the rest of eternity?
222,DEAN,"Well, first of all, you're gonna bring Cas back from wherever you stashed him."
222,GABRIEL,Oh am I.
222,DEAN,Yeah. Or we're going to dunk you in some holy oil and deep-fry ourselves an archangel.
222,DEAN,"Cas, you okay?"
222,CASTIEL,"I'm fine. Hello, Gabriel."
222,GABRIEL,"Hey, bro. How's the search for Daddy going? Let me guess. Awful."
222,DEAN,"Okay, we're out of here. Come on, Sam."
222,GABRIEL,Uh. Okay. Guys?
222,GABRIEL,"So, so what? Huh?"
222,GABRIEL,"You're just gonna, you're gonna leave me here forever?"
222,DEAN,"No. We're not, 'cause we don't screw with people the way you do. And for the record? This isn't about some prize fight between your brothers or some destiny that can't be stopped. This is about you being too afraid to stand up to your family."
222,DEAN,Don't say I never did anything for you.
222,DEAN,"All that stuff he was spouting in there, you think it was the truth?"
222,SAM,I think he believes it.
222,DEAN,So what do we do?
222,SAM,I don't know.
222,DEAN,Well I'll tell you one thing. Right about now I wish I was back in a TV show.
222,SAM,"Yeah, me too."
223,MAN,"ha-ha-ha. Hey Dean, looking good."
223,DEAN,Yeah well serves them right.
223,DEAN,Get downstairs ok? Go go!
223,CHUCK,"(On stage) Ah, what does the future hold for Sam and Dean? Well, how do you feel about angels? Yeah, because let me tell you, they're not nearly as lame as you think."
226,SAM,"Evening, barkeep.  I would like to purchase some alcohol, please."
226,BARTENDER,"Uh-huh, what can I get you?"
226,SAM,"[holding up I.D.] Well, I’m 26. As you can see. From my license."
226,BARTENDER,Congratulations. What can I get you?
226,SAM,"A banana daiquiri, my good man. [SAM looks very pleased.]"
226,WOMAN,[smiling at SAM] I’m Crystal. What’s your name?
226,SAM,"Hi, Crystal. [He holds out his hand and they shake.] I’m Gary."
226,CRYSTAL,"Gary, I don’t want to embarrass you, but you are just – you are just a stunning-looking man."
226,SAM,"I know, right? [He pushes his hair behind his ears.]"
226,SAM,Ooh! Thanks.
226,CRYSTAL,"So Gary, are you having a good time tonight?"
226,SAM,"Mmm! [slurping on the daiquiri] Thank you for asking, Crystal – this is like the best night ever."
226,CRYSTAL,Do you think we could make it any better?
226,SAM,[shrugs] Probably. I don’t know!
226,CRYSTAL,"I mean, do you want to get out of here?"
226,SAM,"Well, I kind of like this bar. And I just ordered this daiquiri."
226,CRYSTAL,"I mean, do you want to get out of here with me?"
226,SAM,[looking around and then whispering] Are we talking about sex?
226,CRYSTAL,"Well, I, uh – [laughs] Yeah. I suppose we are."
226,SAM,"[inhales sharply] Crystal, I would love to have the sex with you."
226,CRYSTAL,[chuckles] Great. Then let's go.
226,CRYSTAL,"Love that jacket on you, by the way."
226,WOMAN,"So, how long has it been?"
226,SAM,The summer before 6th grade.
226,WOMAN,"Mmm, I remember. You assigned yourself your own reading list."
226,DEAN,[chuckling] That’s right. I forgot about that.
226,SAM,[to the TEENAGE GIRL] Your mom happens to be the best babysitter we ever had.
226,WOMAN,"Well, when I was a maid at the Mayflower, out on the interstate – long before you were even an idea – their daddy used to pass through town and leave the boys with me while he went off to... work. One time, he was gone for two weeks."
226,WOMAN,"Mm-hmm. Oh, he'd always come limping back. He loved you boys."
226,WOMAN,"Little Sammy kept trying to tell me. Of course, I didn't believe him. Not at first, anyway."
226,SAM,"Katie, our dad, um, happened to be an expert at getting rid of ghosts. And now, so are we."
226,WOMAN,"That's why I called them, sweetie. They can help us."
226,DEAN,Sounds like you guys got yourself a poltergeist.
226,MAN,Started a month or two after we moved in.
226,DONNA,"Yeah, first it was, uh, just bumps and knocks and scratches on the walls. And then it started breaking things."
226,SAM,And then it attacked Katie?
226,MAN,That was two nights ago.
226,WOMAN,"Can you show them, honey?"
226,SAM,“Murdered Chylde.”
226,DEAN,"Katie, everything's gonna be fine. I promise. Why don't you guys take yourselves a little vacation, and, uh, we'll take care of it."
226,DONNA,[sighs] Thank you.
226,GARY,"Uh, bacon burger turbo, large chilli-cheese fry, uh, and a Health Quake Salad shake?"
226,DEAN,"I know. I know. It's, uh… [clears throat] it's not mine."
226,DEAN,"Oh, you shake it up, baby. You know, poltergeist aside, Donna looked pretty good, don't you think?"
226,SAM,"Dude, don't tell me you've still got the hots for our babysitter."
226,DEAN,"What? No. That's weird.  [chuckles] I'm just saying that she, you know, she – she's – she's doing good. You know, with her husband, her kid. This whole Amityville thing being thrown at them, and they're hanging tough."
226,SAM,Yeah.
226,DEAN,"You ever think that you'd want something like that? Wife, rugrats, the whole nine?"
226,SAM,"[shakes his head ] No, not really my thing anymore."
226,DEAN,Yeah. What do you got?
226,SAM,"Uh, well, that house of theirs, it's old – really old. Um, hundreds of years. And I found a legend. It’s unconfirmed, but still."
226,DEAN,Saying?
226,SAM,"Supposedly, in the 1720s, the house was owned by a guy named Isaiah Pickett. [He turns his laptop to show DEAN a site titled “Witchcraft.”] Legend has it he hung a woman in his backyard for witchcraft – a woman named Maggie Briggs."
226,DEAN,"Okay, so an angry ghost witch?"
226,SAM,"If it's true. [The camera focuses on GARY, who is staring at them.] That still doesn't explain what ""Murdered Chylde"" means."
226,DEAN,"No, or where the bitch is buried."
226,SAM,"You know, I mean, it's a long way back, but I can see if I can find something in the town records."
226,DEAN,It's worth a shot.
226,MANAGER,Gary! Curly fries are up!
226,SAM,"Bupkis. Can't even find proof a woman named Maggie Briggs existed, much less where she was planted."
226,DEAN,"All right. Well, we've got a minute to breathe here, so, uh, let's pick it up first thing."
226,SAM,"Yeah, you bet. See you in a few."
226,SAM,Aah! What...
226,SAM,Who?
226,SAM,My – my family? My brother called you?
226,SAM,"Thanks, uh, but, uh, w-where are we?"
226,SAM,"N-no, officer, I-I'm not staying here."
226,SAM,"Oh, hey! Hey! Hey!"
226,SAM,"Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Um, w-what's going on here?"
226,SAM,"Lady, who are you?"
226,SAM,And who are you?
226,SAM,"My father? Look… [SAM sees GARY’s reflection, rather than his own, in the police car window]  Who is that?! Who the hell is that?!"
226,SAM,Yeah. Tell me about it.
226,SAM,"[in GARY's voice] Oh, yeah. Bring it!"
226,GARY,Holy crap.
226,DEAN,"Sam. Where the hell you been, man? I've been trying to call you for hours."
226,GARY,"I picked up some food. Bacon burger turbo, large chilli-cheese fry, right? Sorry, man. Really.  I-I just – I lost track of time. I didn't mean to freak you out."
226,DEAN,"Thanks. Don't know why it took you two hours, but thanks."
226,GARY,"Oh, you're gonna want to eat that on the road."
226,DEAN,Why?
226,GARY,"The maid came in, saw that [the camera pans to weapons laid out for cleaning], and now they're all kind of freaking out."
226,DEAN,Why'd you let the maid in?
226,GARY,It just happened.
226,DEAN,"Whatever. I got to hit the head, and then we'll take off."
226,GARY,All right. I-I’ll be outside.
226,DEAN,Hey. You ready?
226,GARY,"Absolutely. [DEAN gets in.] Hey, can I drive?"
226,GARY,"Oh, this is so sweet! [He revs the engine.]"
226,DEAN,"You want to get the lead out, Andretti? Come on. [GARY puts the car into gear.] Reverse. Reverse!"
226,DEAN,It's in reverse.
226,GARY,"I am really, really sorry."
226,DEAN,Shut up.
226,SAM,"Dean, I've called every phone we got. Where are you, man? [We see GARY’s body reflected in the mirror.] So, this is gonna sound crazy, really crazy, but, um – I think I'm in the wrong body.  [chuckles nervously] Could use a little help here. I-I think I got asthma. Call me back."
226,SAM,"Hello, uh, could you please connect me to room 102?"
226,MAN,"102? Uh, nah, man, those guys checked out middle of the night."
226,SAM,"Wait – ""guys""? Plural?"
226,MAN,"Yeah – uh, one leather jacket, one Sasquatch. They left."
226,SAM,"Smart kid. [He takes a Star Wars Darth Vader t-shirt off the clothes rack and sighs.] Virgin. [He opens a box he found under the bed, which contains a Busty Asian Beauties magazine.] Frustrated virgin. [He finds a black dagger and a black cloth with a pentagram.] Witchcraft, huh, Gary? You little Satanic bastard."
226,SAM,Leave me alone.
226,SAM,"All right, I'm coming!"
226,SAM,[exhales sharply] So would I. Believe me.
226,SAM,The plan?
226,SAM,"Right, yeah. Listen, buddy, no offense, but at the moment, I could give a rat's ass about your plan."
226,SAM,"Uh… huh. Listen, h-have I seemed, uh, moody lately? Withdrawn?"
226,SAM,Any – any occult fixations?
226,SAM,Let me guess – I'm amazing at Latin.
226,SAM,"Hmm. Um, any of the neighbourhood pets go missing recently?"
226,SAM,"Have any of you seen me w-w-with a book? It'd be big and old, uh, leather-bound, maybe some strange writing on it. Or [sighs] frankly, I'm probably hiding it."
226,SAM,W-what?
226,SAM,Gluten.
226,SAM,What?
226,SAM,"So there is a book. Sydney, where do I keep it?"
226,GARY,"So, uh, where we going, anyway?"
226,DEAN,To work. The case?
226,GARY,"Oh, right. Yeah – the case. Of course. Where, uh, do you want to start?"
226,DEAN,"Well, since you couldn't find where Maggie Briggs was buried, now we have to do an all-day tombstone roll to see if we can dig her up."
226,GARY,"Wait. M-Maggie Briggs? You mean, like – like, the witch Maggie Briggs?"
226,DEAN,"Yeah, Sherlock."
226,GARY,"Yeah, she's in the basement."
226,DEAN,Come again? W-what basement?
226,GARY,"Isaiah Pickett’s house. Okay, there's this legend that he hung her, but he didn't. The real truth is that she was carrying his illegitimate child, and he killed her and then buried her in the basement."
226,DEAN,The murdered chylde. That would explain the scratches. How do you know all this?
226,GARY,"Oh, I've done all kinds of research on it. [DEAN looks at him in surprise.] I mean, you know, last night."
226,DEAN,Yeah. Nice work... I guess.
226,GARY,"Aw, man, turn it up!"
226,DEAN,Seriously?
226,GARY,Hell yeah!
226,SAM,"Yeah, I'm Gary... Gary is okay."
226,SAM,"Got drunk. No big thing. Look, uh, what's my locker number?"
226,SAM,"Yeah, yeah, I see, like, three of you right now. Um, so – so, what's my locker number?"
226,SAM,"Oh, no, Gary. [He sighs.] This is a very, very bad book."
226,GARYS,"Boo-yah! Master chief is in the house, bizatches!"
226,DEAN,Are you all right?
226,GARY,Yeah. Fine.
226,DEAN,"Well, I'll be damned. Willow moss."
226,GARY,"Yeah, right. It's, uh, supposed to grow over witches' graves, right?"
226,DEAN,[as if SAM should definitely know that] Yeah.
226,GARY,"Hey, man, I'm really sorry about this."
226,DEAN,Sorry about what?
226,DEAN,Sam! [He rushes to GARY and helps him up.] You okay?
226,GARY,Let's get the hell out of here!
226,DEAN,"Wait, wait, wait. We still got to burn the body, you idiot. Come on."
226,GARY,"Dude, that was sweet!"
226,SAM,I got something to do.
226,SAM,"I’m just… not feeling like myself, okay?"
226,SAM,I don't have time. I got to go. I'm sorry. [He turns away.]
226,TREVOR,"Well, what else was I supposed to do?"
226,WAITRESS,"Here you go, guys."
226,DEAN,"You know, do me a favor, sweetheart. Would you bring me a cheeseburger with extra bacon? And fry an egg on top of it, would you?"
226,WAITRESS,Absolutely.
226,GARY,"Ooh, that – that sounds good. Ditto."
226,WAITRESS,Be right back with your order.
226,DEAN,"Okay, who are you and what have you done with Sam?"
226,GARY,W-what do you mean?
226,DEAN,Bacon cheeseburgers now?
226,GARY,"I don't know. I eat them, don't I? Anyways, we are celebrating. [He lifts his glass in a toast.]"
226,DEAN,"Yeah, I guess. Another one bites the dust. Nice work today."
226,GARY,"You too. I had a, uh, really awesome day, man. Seriously. [He downs his drink.] Whoo! Sweet."
226,DEAN,A really awesome day?
226,GARY,Yeah. Why not?
226,DEAN,"It was a random, D-list ghost hunt. That’s – that's awesome to you?"
226,GARY,I can't be in a good mood?
226,DEAN,"Yeah, I guess, I just… No, actually. It's not really your style, Sam."
226,GARY,"Well, then, it's a new me. I mean, come on. Why shouldn't I be happy? I've got a gun, I'm getting drunk, and [he points his finger at his face] I look like this. [sighs] I don't know. You ever feel like your whole future is being decided for you?"
226,DEAN,"Uh, yeah, Sam, I feel like that a lot."
226,GARY,"No matter how much you fight it, you can't stop the plan. The stupid, stupid plan. So, I don't know. I guess it's, uh, it's just nice to do a little ass-kicking for a change, that's all. Uh, you know what? I – I'm drunk. [chuckles] Sorry. Just – just forget it."
226,DEAN,"No, no. It's all right. It’s, uh… I'll drink to that. [They clink glasses and drink.] Wow, you know, is it just me, or are we actually drinking together?"
226,GARY,"We don't do it that often, huh?"
226,DEAN,"[scoffs] Yeah, you could say that."
226,GARY,"Well, we should. You're a good guy, Dean."
226,DEAN,"Oh, you are drunk."
226,WAITRESS,Here you go.
226,DEAN,Mmm. Thank you.
226,WAITRESS,Enjoy.
226,GARY,"No, but I mean it. You really are a good guy. [He takes a bite of his burger.] Mmm! The bread alone! Mmm!"
226,CRYSTAL,"Love that jacket on you, by the way."
226,GARY,"Thanks. Actually, the whole outfit is new."
226,GARY,We're gonna do it!
226,SAM,Hey! What the hell's going on?!
226,TREVOR,You can scream all you want. [loudly] No one can hear you! My parents are out of town!
226,TREVOR,Where are you?
226,GARY,"Uh, I can't really tell you right now, but, man, you wouldn't believe it."
226,TREVOR,"Well, where's Dean?"
226,GARY,"Uh, the Cloverleaf on Route 6. Why?"
226,TREVOR,You mean you haven't killed him yet?
226,SAM,"What? Wait, wait, wait, wait. W-what do you mean? Kill Dean?"
226,GARY,Building up to it.
226,TREVOR,"Look, Gary, we got problems here. For one, I'm looking at your body right now – with this other dude in it."
226,GARY,What?
226,TREVOR,"Yeah, he's been in your house. He's hanging out with your parents."
226,GARY,"Okay just... calm down. Whatever he says, no one's gonna believe him, right? I mean, w-we're still good."
226,TREVOR,"Would you just hurry up and kill the son of a bitch already, would you?"
226,GARY,Don't rush me. I'll do it.
226,TREVOR,"Yeah, you better."
226,GARY,"Got to go. [He hangs up. CRYSTAL smacks the whip on her palm.] Oh, man. I am in way over my head."
226,TREVOR,I don't think he's gonna do it.
226,SAM,What the hell is going on here? How do you know who Dean is?
226,TREVOR,Everybody knows Dean. He’s Hell’s most wanted.
226,SAM,"Oh, no. No. Have you idiots been talking to demons?"
226,TREVOR,"Oh, right. We're the idiots."
226,SAM,[sighs] You're just kids. You have no idea what you're messing with.
226,TREVOR,"Well, we know that there's a price on Dean's head, and we're the ones that are gonna collect."
226,SAM,What's that supposed to mean?
226,TREVOR,Nora.
226,NORA,"We’re not allowed to talk about him? We were down here, goofing around with that book."
226,TREVOR,"Um, I wouldn't exactly call praying to our dark overlord “goofing around.”"
226,NORA,"Don’t be a loser, Trev."
226,SAM,"Yeah, Trev."
226,NORA,"Anyway, all of a sudden, the lights flickered and Gary went into this weird trance. He closed his eyes, picked up a pencil, and drew this. [She shows SAM a drawing of DEAN.]"
226,TREVOR,And you know what's really weird? Gary can't draw.
226,NORA,He said he heard a voice in his head. The demons were putting out a bounty on this guy.
226,SAM,A bounty?
226,NORA,"Yeah, like, every witch or Satanist across the whole country. But Gary – Gary’s the one who spotted you."
226,SAM,"And the ""Freaky Friday"" crap?"
226,NORA,Another spell from the book. Gary's idea – go in Trojan horse-style. He's really smart.
226,TREVOR,"That is, if he has the beanbags to go through with it."
226,SAM,Listen to me. You are making a terrible mistake. We're talking about a demon deal – killing somebody. This isn't a game. You're crossing a line you won't come back from. Believe me.
226,TREVOR,What?
226,NORA,Nothing. I-I...
226,TREVOR,"Nora, don't tell me you're actually listening to this jerk."
226,NORA,"I don't know. M-maybe. I-I mean, what if he has a point?"
226,TREVOR,"I don't believe this. First Gary, now you. I can't – you know what? Fine. You want something done right..."
226,NORA,"What, you're gonna – you're gonna go kill Dean yourself, tough guy?"
226,TREVOR,Don't have to. I can do this. [He holds up the witchcraft book open to a page about demon summoning.]
226,NORA,"N-no, no. Y-you can't be serious."
226,TREVOR,"I'm calling up one of these bad boys, turning these punks over, and getting paid. Dolla, dolla bills, y'all!"
226,NORA,I-I really don't think that that's a good idea.
226,SAM,"It's not. It's a very, very bad idea."
226,TREVOR,No one asked you.
226,DEAN,You're not Sam. Who the hell are you?
226,GARY,Ow!
226,SAM,Don't do this. I'm begging you.
226,NORA,"Trevor, I think he's right."
226,TREVOR,"Hey, you want to get into Vassar, don't you?"
226,SAM,Please! Stop! [TREVOR commences the spell.] You're gonna get us all killed!
226,TREVOR,Ad ligandum eos pariter eos coram me! [Nothing seems to have happened.] Maybe I said it wrong. [He turns and sees NORA slumped on the floor.] Nora?
226,SAM,"No! No, no! Don't touch her!"
226,TREVOR,"Nora, you okay?"
226,NORA/DEMON,"Oh, yeah. I'm peachy."
226,NORA/DEMON,"So, what'd you call me here for, Skippy? Unless... it's dinnertime?"
226,TREVOR,"What? I-I... n-no. Uh, we have Dean Winchester."
226,NORA/DEMON,You do? Where?
226,SAM,"Trevor, keep your mouth shut."
226,TREVOR,The Cloverleaf Motel over on Route 6.
226,NORA/DEMON,"Sam? Is that you in there? [laughs] Well, aren't you just 98 pounds of nothing."
226,SAM,The kid is a moron. He doesn't have any idea where Dean is.
226,NORA/DEMON,"[laughs] So, if Sam’s in this body, who's in Sam’s?"
226,TREVOR,A dangerous warlock. Named Gary.
226,NORA/DEMON,You mean to tell me you've got Dean Winchester and Sam Winchester's meat suit? An empty vessel just waiting to be filled. And you're handing them both over to me?
226,TREVOR,"Uh, y-yeah. I guess."
226,NORA/DEMON,Well... I got to hand it to you. I'm impressed.
226,TREVOR,"Thanks. Um, so if you don't mind my asking... there's a reward?"
226,NORA/DEMON,Sure. My undying gratitude.
226,TREVOR,"[chuckles] What, are you serious?"
226,SAM,"Be quiet, you idiot!"
226,NORA/DEMON,"Consider yourself lucky, kid."
226,TREVOR,"[sighs] Um, wait a minute! We worked our asses off here, and, uh, I want my reward! [NORA/DEMON stares at him.] Please?"
226,NORA/DEMON,[chuckles] Okay. I'm sorry. You're right. What can I get you?
226,TREVOR,"Well, h-how about a million bucks?"
226,SAM,"Oh, for God's sake, Trevor, just shut up and run!"
226,NORA/DEMON,A million doesn't buy you much these days. Why not make it 10?
226,TREVOR,"Okay, $10 mill. And I want... I want Mindy Schwartz to fall in love with me."
226,NORA/DEMON,Love... money. [chuckles] Sticking to the basics. I can respect that. But here's my counter.
226,NORA/DEMON,Yep. Tastes like moron. [She smiles at SAM.]
226,DEAN,"All right, pal. Either you start talking or I start water boarding."
226,GARY,"Oh, my God. Please, don't hurt me. Please! I'm sorry! I'm so, so sorry!"
226,DEAN,"Hey, pull it together, champ."
226,GARY,I don't want to die. I don't want to die.
226,DEAN,Where's Sam?
226,GARY,In my – my friend's basement. His parents are out of town.
226,DEAN,Parents? How old are you?
226,GARY,17.
226,DEAN,17? Huh.
226,GARY,Nora?
226,NORA/DEMON,Not at the moment.
226,SAM,[grunting] Whew! [breathing heavily] Damn it!
226,NORA/DEMON,"Boy, you earned your dessert tonight, kiddo. Tell me – what is it you want? Anything."
226,GARY,Anything?
226,NORA/DEMON,Lay it on me.
226,GARY,I want to be a witch. For real. And really powerful.
226,NORA/DEMON,"Mm. Good choice. I get it. No daddy, no M.I.T. No plan. You get to be big and strong, and no one can tell you what to do anymore. There's just one small formality first. You got to meet the boss."
226,GARY,The boss?
226,NORA/DEMON,"You know – your Satanic majesty, or whatever the kids are calling it these days."
226,GARY,The devil?
226,NORA/DEMON,Mm-hmm.
226,GARY,"Uh... no. O-okay. Um, it's okay. I... don't really want to bother him."
226,NORA/DEMON,"Oh, but he's gonna want to meet you. Relax. It'll be easy. He's just gonna ask you one little question, and all you got to do is say “yes”. And then, you get your reward."
226,GARY,"Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus."
226,NORA/DEMON,What was that?
226,GARY,"Uh, n-nothing."
226,NORA/DEMON,Were you trying exorcize me?! You little piece of crap! [She grabs GARY by the throat and lifts him off the ground.]
226,DEAN,"Spiritus, omnis satanica potestas."
226,GARY,Omnis incursio infernalis adversii.
226,DEAN,Omnis congregatio.
226,GARY,Et secta diabolica.
226,DEAN,"Ergo, draco maledicte."
226,GARY,Ecclesiam tuam securi tibi facias libertate servire.
226,DEAN,"Te rogamus. Adios, bitch!"
226,GARY,"Uh, it’s ""adinos.”"
226,NORA/DEMON,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
226,GARY,"Animae domum redeant. Fas atque nefas instauretur. Potestate et auctoritate, sic fiat."
226,DEAN,"So, we good?"
226,SAM,"Yeah. We're good. Oh, man, it's nice to be back."
226,GARY,Yeah. Awesome.
226,DEAN,So… [clears throat] Gary.
226,GARY,I know – my bad.
226,DEAN,"""My bad""? Kid, ""my bad"" ain't gonna cut it. See, if you were of voting age... you'd be dead. Because we would kill you. So either you straighten up and fly right or we will kill you. Are we clear?"
226,GARY,Crystal.
226,DEAN,Good.
226,GARY,Crap.
226,SAM,"Gary, take it from someone who knows – chin up, man. Your life ain't that bad."
226,GARY,"Uh, you met my parents."
226,SAM,"Yeah. So what? It's your life. You don't like their plan for you, tell them to cram it. Rebel a little bit. In a healthy, non-Satanic way, of course. By the way, you know why Nora’s into witchcraft?"
226,GARY,What do you mean?
226,SAM,"She doesn't like Satan, you moron. She likes you."
226,GARY,Really?  You think?
226,SAM,"Yeah, I know. I'm telling you, kid – I wish I had your life."
226,GARY,You do? Thanks.
226,SAM,Get out of here.
226,DEAN,That was a nice thing to say.
226,SAM,"I totally lied. That kid's life sucked ass. [SAM and DEAN get into the IMPALA.] All that apple-pie, family crap? It's stressful. Trust me – we didn't miss a damn thing."
226,DEAN,Or we don't know what we're missing.
226,SAM,"Oh, come on, man. Turn it down. [DEAN does so.]"
226,DEAN,"Welcome back, Kotter."
227,ANNA,I remember now. I'm an angel.
227,CASTIEL,You really shouldn't have come.
227,CASTIEL,You have to stop it.
227,DEAN,Stop what?
227,DEAN,Mom?
227,JOHN,John Winchester.
227,DEAN,"My parents are Mary and John Winchester, and I am your grandson."
227,DEAN,No!
227,CASTIEL,"Destiny can't be changed, Dean. All roads lead to the same destination."
227,DEAN,"Oh, I take it all back. I love the devil."
227,DEAN,"Now, that's what I call peace on earth."
227,DEAN,Anna?
227,DEAN,"I was just, uh, working on a case."
227,ANNA,This is what you dream about.
227,DEAN,This is awkward. Why are you gate-crashing my head? Why don't you just swing by the motel?
227,ANNA,I can't find you.
227,DEAN,Oh. Cas did this thing.
227,ANNA,"Cas. Right. Now, there's a friend you can count on."
227,DEAN,What?
227,ANNA,He didn't tell you?
227,DEAN,Tell me what?
227,ANNA,Where I've been. Of course not. Why would he?
227,DEAN,Where have you been?
227,ANNA,"Prison. Upstairs. All the torture, twice the self-righteousness."
227,DEAN,Why wouldn't he have told us where you were?
227,ANNA,Because he's the one who turned me in. Don't look so shocked. He was always a good little soldier. Did anything under orders.
227,DEAN,I didn't know. Are you okay?
227,ANNA,No. And I don't have long. I broke out. Barely. They're looking for me. If they find me—
227,DEAN,Okay. What do you need?
227,ANNA,"Meet me. Two-two-five Industrial. And, please, just—"
227,ANNA,Hurry.
227,ANNA,Hello? Who's there?
227,CASTIEL,"Hello, Anna."
227,ANNA,Well. If I didn't know any better...
227,ANNA,I'd say the Winchesters don't trust me.
227,CASTIEL,They do. I don't. I wouldn't let them come.
227,ANNA,And why is that?
227,CASTIEL,"If you're out of prison, it's because they let you out. And they sent you here to do their dirty work."
227,ANNA,And what makes you so sure?
227,CASTIEL,Because I've experienced...heaven's persuasion.
227,ANNA,You mean when you gave me to them.
227,CASTIEL,That was a mistake.
227,CASTIEL,"Anna, whatever they sent you here to do—"
227,ANNA,They didn't send me. I escaped.
227,CASTIEL,No one escapes.
227,ANNA,"All these centuries, and you're underestimating me now?"
227,CASTIEL,"If you're not one of them, then what do you want?"
227,ANNA,I want to help.
227,CASTIEL,You want to help?
227,ANNA,Yes.
227,CASTIEL,Then what are doing with that knife?
227,ANNA,I'm not allowed to defend myself?
227,CASTIEL,Against whom? That blade doesn't work against angels. It's not like this one.
227,CASTIEL,Maybe you're not working for Heaven. But there's something you're not telling me.
227,ANNA,Sam Winchester has to die.
227,ANNA,I'm sorry but we have no choice. He's Lucifer's vessel.
227,CASTIEL,He's not the only one.
227,ANNA,"What, that guy Nick?"
227,ANNA,He's burning away as we speak. No.
227,ANNA,"Sam is the only vessel that matters. You know what that means? If Lucifer can't take Sam, his whole plan short-circuits. No fight with Michael, no Croatoan virus."
227,ANNA,The Horsemen go back to their day jobs.
227,CASTIEL,"Even if you could...kill Sam, Satan would just bring him back to life."
227,ANNA,Not after I scatter his cells across the universe.
227,ANNA,They'll never find him. Not all of him.
227,CASTIEL,We'll find another way.
227,ANNA,How's that going?
227,ANNA,"How's the Colt working out? Or the search for God? Is anything working? If you want to stop the devil, this is how."
227,CASTIEL,The answer's still no. Because Sam is my friend.
227,ANNA,You've changed.
227,CASTIEL,"Maybe too late, but I have."
227,CASTIEL,"Anna, we've been through much together, but you come near Sam Winchester and I'll kill you."
227,DEAN,Really? Anna? I don't believe it.
227,CASTIEL,It's true.
227,DEAN,"So she's gone all Glenn Close, huh? That's awesome."
227,CASTIEL,Who's Glenn Close?
227,DEAN,"No one, just this psycho bitch who likes to boil rabbits."
227,SAM,"So the plan to kill me, would it actually stop Satan?"
227,DEAN,"No, Sam, come on."
227,SAM,"Cas, what do you think? Does Anna have a point?"
227,CASTIEL,"No. She's, uh, Glenn Close."
227,DEAN,I don't get it. We're looking for the chick that wants to gank Sam.
227,DEAN,Why poke the bear?
227,CASTIEL,Anna will keep trying. She won't give up until Sam is dead. So we kill her first.
227,CASTIEL,Zod ah ma ra la—
227,CASTIEL,—ee est la gi ro sa.
227,CASTIEL,I've found her.
227,DEAN,Where is she?
227,CASTIEL,Not where. When.
227,CASTIEL,It's nineteen seventy-eight.
227,SAM,What?
227,SAM,Why nineteen seventy-eight? I wasn't even born yet.
227,CASTIEL,You won't be if she kills your parents.
227,SAM,What?
227,CASTIEL,Anna can't get to you because of me. So she's going after them.
227,DEAN,Take us back right now.
227,CASTIEL,And deliver you right to Anna? I should go alone.
227,DEAN,"They're our parents. Cas, we're going."
227,CASTIEL,It's not that easy.
227,SAM,Why not?
227,CASTIEL,Time travel was difficult even with the powers of heaven at my disposal.
227,SAM,Which got cut off.
227,DEAN,"So, what, you're like a Delorean without enough plutonium?"
227,CASTIEL,"I don't understand that reference. But I'm telling you, taking this trip, with passengers no less—"
227,CASTIEL,—it'll weaken me.
227,DEAN,"They're our mom and dad. If we can save them, and not just from Anna... I mean if we can set things right, we have to try."
227,CASTIEL,Ready?
227,SAM,Not really.
227,DEAN,Bend your knees.
227,DRIVER,Get out of the street!
227,SAM,Did we make it?
227,DEAN,"Unless they're bringing Pintos back into production, I, uh, I'd say yes."
227,SAM,Cas?
227,DEAN,Hey.
227,SAM,"Hey, hey, hey."
227,DEAN,Take it easy. Take it easy. Are you all right?
227,CASTIEL,I'm fine. I'm much better than I expected.
227,SAM,Cas?
227,SAM,He's breathing. Sort of. What do we do?
227,SAM,"I mean, the mustaches alone..."
227,DEAN,"So I paid for Cas for five nights up in the, uh, honeymoon suite. I told the manager, 'Do not disturb no matter what.' You know what he said to me? 'Yeah. Don't sweat it. Want to buy some dope?'"
227,DEAN,"Dope. We ought to stick around here, buy some stock in Microsoft."
227,SAM,"Yeah, we might have to if Cas doesn't recover. Is he all right?"
227,DEAN,"What do I look like—Dr. Angel, Medicine Woman? He'll wake up. He's, you know, tough for a little nerdy dude with wings."
227,SAM,"If he landed like that, hopefully, so did Anna. Should buy us some time."
227,DEAN,"So, did you find 'em?"
227,SAM,"Yeah. Uh, the Winchesters. Four-eight-five Robintree."
227,DEAN,Let's go pop in on the folks.
227,DEAN,"Sam. Sam. Wait, wait, wait, wait."
227,SAM,"Dean, Anna could be here any second."
227,DEAN,What exactly are we gonna march up there and tell 'em?
227,SAM,"Uh, the truth."
227,DEAN,"What, that their sons are back from the future to save them from an angel? Gone Terminator? Come on. Those movies haven't even come out yet."
227,SAM,"Well, then tell her demons are after 'em. I mean, she thinks you're a hunter, right?"
227,DEAN,"Yeah, a hunter who disappeared right when her dad died. She's gonna love me."
227,DEAN,Just follow my lead.
227,MARY,How was work?
227,JOHN,"It was, uh, great."
227,MARY,Ah! Not until you wash up.
227,JOHN,I love when you get bossy.
227,DEAN,"Hi, Mary."
227,MARY,You can't be here.
227,DEAN,I'm sorry if this is a bad time.
227,MARY,You don't understand. I'm not—
227,MARY,I don't do that anymore. I have a normal life now. You have to go.
227,DEAN,"I'm sorry, but this is important, okay?"
227,MARY,"Sorry, sweetie, they're just..."
227,DEAN,Mary's cousins.
227,DEAN,"Yeah, we couldn't stop through town without swinging by and saying 'hey', now, could we?"
227,DEAN,Dean.
227,JOHN,You look familiar.
227,DEAN,"Really? Yeah, you do, too, actually, you know? We must have met sometime. Small towns, right? Got to love 'em."
227,JOHN,I'm John.
227,DEAN,This is Sam.
227,JOHN,"Sam. Uh, Mary's father was a Sam."
227,DEAN,"Uh, it's a—it's a family name."
227,JOHN,"You okay, pal? You look a little spooked."
227,SAM,"Oh. Oh, yeah. Just a...long trip."
227,DEAN,Yeah.
227,MARY,"Well, Sam and Dean were just on their way out."
227,JOHN,What? They just got here. Real happy to meet folks from Mary's side. Please come on in for a beer.
227,DEAN,Twist my arm.
227,JOHN,"Are you sure you're okay, Sam?"
227,SAM,"W—oh. Yeah, yeah. Um, I'm just, um—You are so beautiful."
227,DEAN,"He means that in a—a non-weird, wholesome, family kind of a way."
227,SAM,"Yeah, right."
227,DEAN,"We haven't seen Mary in—in quite some time, and—See, she's the spitting image of our mom. I mean, it's—it's—"
227,SAM,Eerie.
227,JOHN,"So, how are you guys related?"
227,DEAN,"You know, uh, distantly."
227,JOHN,Oh. So you knew Mary's parents?
227,DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mary's dad was, uh, pretty much like a grandpa to us."
227,JOHN,Oh. That was tragic—that heart attack.
227,DEAN,"Yes, it was."
227,JOHN,"So, uh, what are you guys doing in town, anyway?"
227,DEAN,"Uh, business, you know."
227,JOHN,"Oh, yeah? What line of work?"
227,SAM,Plumbing.
227,DEAN,Scrap metal.
227,MARY,"Oh, gosh. It's almost seven. I hate to be rude, but I got to get dinner ready."
227,JOHN,Maybe they could stay.
227,MARY,I'm sure they have to leave.
227,JOHN,"Uh, look, please stay. You know, it would mean a lot to me. I haven't met much of Mary's side of the family."
227,JOHN,"Look, Mr. Woodson, I'm begging you to reconsider."
227,JOHN,E-even just part time. I really need this job.
227,JOHN,You serious?
227,ANNA,I'll see you in ten minutes. Don't keep me waiting.
227,MARY,You have to leave. Now.
227,DEAN,"Okay, just listen—"
227,MARY,"No, you listen. Last time I saw you, a demon killed my parents. Now you waltz in here like you're family? Whatever you want—no. Leave me alone."
227,SAM,You and John are in danger.
227,MARY,What are you talking about?
227,DEAN,Something's coming for you.
227,MARY,Demon?
227,DEAN,Not exactly.
227,MARY,"Well, what, then?"
227,DEAN,"It's kind of hard to explain, okay? It's—it's—"
227,SAM,An angel.
227,MARY,What? There's no such thing.
227,DEAN,I wish. But they're twice as strong as demons. And bigger dicks.
227,MARY,Why would an angel want to kill us?
227,DEAN,"It's a long story, and we'll tell you the whole thing, but right now, you've got to trust us, and we got to go. Look at my face and tell me if I'm lying to you."
227,MARY,Okay. Where do we go?
227,DEAN,"Out of here. We got to move now, though."
227,MARY,Okay. But what do I tell John?
227,DEAN,Just tell him—
227,DEAN,John?
227,JOHN,Mr. Woodson? You still here?
227,DEAN,"I wish I could say it's good to see you, Anna."
227,ANNA,"You too, Dean."
227,ANNA,I'm sorry.
227,ANNA,Sorry. It's not that easy to kill an angel.
227,SAM,No.
227,SAM,But you can distract 'em.
227,JOHN,Monsters. Monsters?
227,MARY,Yes.
227,JOHN,Monsters are real.
227,MARY,"I'm sorry, I didn't know how—"
227,JOHN,And you fight them? All of you?
227,SAM,Yeah.
227,JOHN,How long?
227,MARY,"All my life. John, just try to understand—"
227,DEAN,She didn't exactly have a choice—
227,JOHN,"Shut up, all of you! Look, not another word, or so help me, I will turn this car around!"
227,DEAN,Wow. Awkward family road trip.
227,SAM,No kidding.
227,MARY,Place has been in the family for years.
227,MARY,"Devil's trap. Pure iron fixtures, of course."
227,MARY,"Um, there should be salt and holy water in the pantry, knives, guns."
227,SAM,All that stuff will do is piss it off.
227,MARY,"So, what will kill it? Or slow it down, at least?"
227,SAM,Not much.
227,MARY,Great.
227,DEAN,"He said not much, not nothing. We packed."
227,DEAN,If we put this up and she comes close—
227,DEAN,—we beam her right off the starship.
227,MARY,Mm.
227,SAM,"This is holy oil. It's kind of like a, like a devil's trap for angels.  Come on. I'll show you how it works."
227,JOHN,"Hey, what's the deal with the thing on the paper?"
227,DEAN,It's a sigil. That means—
227,JOHN,I don't care what it means. Where does it go?
227,DEAN,On a wall or a door.
227,JOHN,How big should I make it?
227,DEAN,John—
227,JOHN,"What? Y'all might have treated me like a fool, but I am not useless. I can draw a damn—"
227,JOHN,—whatever it is—a sigil.
227,DEAN,Why don't you go help Sam out? Okay? 'Cause this has got to be done in...it's got to be done in human blood.
227,JOHN,"So, how big?"
227,DEAN,I'll show you.
227,JOHN,What?
227,DEAN,"All of a sudden, you...you really remind me of my dad."
227,SAM,That's really good.
227,JOHN,You come to check on me?
227,SAM,Uh...I wanted to say I—I'm sorry about all this. I—I know it's a lot.
227,JOHN,"Look, how long have you known about this...hunting stuff?"
227,SAM,Pretty much forever. My dad raised me in it.
227,JOHN,You're serious? Who the hell does that to a kid?
227,SAM,"Well, I mean, for the record, Mary's parents did."
227,JOHN,"I don't care. You know, what kind of irresponsible bastard lets a child anywhere near—Y-you know, you could've been killed!"
227,SAM,"I, uh...came kind of close."
227,JOHN,The number it must've done on your head...Your father was supposed to protect you.
227,SAM,He was trying. He died trying. Believe me.
227,SAM,"I used to be mad at him. I—I mean, I used to... I used to hate the guy. But now I—I... I get it. He was...just doing the best he could."
227,SAM,"And he was trying to keep it together in—in—in this impossible situation. See... My mom, um... She was amazing, beautiful, and she was the love of his life. And she got killed. And...I think he would have gone crazy if he didn't do something. Truth is, um, my dad died before I got to tell him that I understand why he did what he did. And I forgive him for what it did to us. I do. And I just—I love him."
227,ANNA,Uriel.
227,ANNA,You look well.
227,URIEL,"You shouldn't have called. We're under strict orders not to come down here, much less take a vessel."
227,URIEL,You're not the Anna of now.
227,ANNA,"No, but thirty years from now, I'm still your superior. I need you to kill some humans."
227,URIEL,Always happy to do some smiting. But what's going on?
227,ANNA,"In the future, these people are going to kill you, Uriel. I'm giving you the chance to kill them first."
227,URIEL,Thank you.
227,MARY,Okay. You said you'd explain everything when we had a minute. We have a minute. Why does an angel want me dead?
227,DEAN,'Cause they're dicks.
227,MARY,"Not good enough. I didn't even know they existed, and now I'm a target?"
227,DEAN,It's complicated.
227,MARY,Fine.
227,MARY,All ears.
227,DEAN,"You're just gonna have to trust me, okay?"
227,MARY,I've been trusting you all day.
227,DEAN,It's kind of hard to believe.
227,MARY,"All right, then. I'm walking out the door."
227,DEAN,I'm your son.
227,MARY,What?
227,DEAN,"I'm your son. Sorry. I don't know how else to say it. We're from the year two thousand and ten. An angel zapped us back here. Not the one that attacked you, friendlier."
227,MARY,You can't expect me to believe that.
227,DEAN,"Our names are Dean and Sam Winchester. We're named after your parents. When I would get sick, you would make me tomato-rice soup, because that's what your mom made you. And instead of a lullaby, you would sing ""Hey Jude"", 'cause that's your favorite Beatles song."
227,MARY,I...I don't believe it. No.
227,DEAN,"I'm sorry, but it's true."
227,MARY,I raised my kids to be hunters?
227,DEAN,"No. No, you didn't."
227,MARY,How could I do that to you?
227,DEAN,You didn't do it. Because you're dead.
227,MARY,What? What happened?
227,DEAN,"Yellow-eyed demon. He killed you, and—"
227,DEAN,"John became a hunter to get revenge. He raised us in this life. Listen to me. A demon comes into Sam's nursery exactly six months after he's born. November second, nineteen eighty-three. Remember that date. And whatever you do, do not go in there. You wake up that morning and you take Sam and you run."
227,SAM,"That's not good enough, Dean."
227,SAM,"Wherever she goes, the demon's gonna find her. Find me."
227,DEAN,"Well, then what?"
227,SAM,She can leave Dad. That's what. You got to leave John.
227,MARY,What?
227,SAM,"When this is all over, walk away, and never look back."
227,DEAN,So we're never born.
227,DEAN,He's right.
227,MARY,"I—I can't. You're saying that you're my children, and now you're saying—"
227,DEAN,"You have no other choice. There's a big difference between dying and never being born. And trust me, we're okay with it, I promise you that."
227,MARY,"Okay, well, I'm not."
227,SAM,"Listen, you think you can have that normal life that you want so bad, but you can't. I'm sorry. It's all gonna go rotten. You are gonna die, and your children will be cursed."
227,MARY,There—there has to be a way.
227,SAM,"No, this is the way. Leave John."
227,MARY,I can't.
227,SAM,This is bigger than us. There are so many more lives at stake—
227,MARY,It's too late. I'm...I'm pregnant.
227,JOHN,"Hey, we got a problem. Those blood things, the sigils—they're gone."
227,SAM,Gone as in...
227,JOHN,"I drew one on the back of the door. I turned around. And when I looked back again, it was a smudge."
227,DEAN,He's right.
227,MARY,There's no more holy oil.
227,DEAN,Who the hell are you?
227,URIEL,I'm Uriel.
227,DEAN,"Oh, come on."
227,SAM,Go.
227,DEAN,Here goes nothin'.
227,MARY,John!
227,DEAN,Sammy!
227,DEAN,Sam!
227,ANNA,I'm really sorry.
227,JOHN,Anna.
227,ANNA,Michael.
227,URIEL,Michael. I didn't know.
227,MICHAEL,"Goodbye, Uriel."
227,MARY,What did you do to John?
227,MICHAEL,John is fine.
227,MARY,Who—what are you?
227,MICHAEL,Shh...
227,MICHAEL,"Well, I'd say this conversation is long overdue, wouldn't you?"
227,DEAN,Fix him.
227,MICHAEL,First...we talk. Then I fix your darling little Sammy.
227,DEAN,"How'd you get in my dad, anyway?"
227,MICHAEL,"I told him I could save his wife, and he said yes."
227,DEAN,I guess they oversold me being your one and only vessel.
227,MICHAEL,You're my true vessel but not my only one.
227,DEAN,What is that supposed to mean?
227,MICHAEL,It's a bloodline.
227,DEAN,A bloodline?
227,MICHAEL,"Stretching back to Cain and Abel. It's in your blood, your father's blood, your family's blood."
227,DEAN,Awesome. Six degrees of Heaven Bacon. What do you want with me?
227,MICHAEL,You really don't know the answer to that?
227,DEAN,"Well, you know I ain't gonna say yes, so why are you here? What do you want with me?!"
227,MICHAEL,I just want you to understand what you and I have to do.
227,DEAN,"Oh, I get it. You got beef with your brother. Well, get some therapy, pal. Don't take it out on my planet!"
227,MICHAEL,"You're wrong. Lucifer defied our father, and he betrayed me. But still...I don't want this any more than you would want to kill Sam."
227,MICHAEL,"You know, my brother, I practically raised him. I took care of him in a way most people could never understand, and I still love him."
227,MICHAEL,But I am going to kill him because it is right and I have to.
227,DEAN,"Oh, because God says so?"
227,MICHAEL,"Yes. From the beginning, he knew this was how it was going to end."
227,DEAN,And you're just gonna do whatever God says.
227,MICHAEL,"Yes, because I am a good son."
227,DEAN,"Okay, well, trust me, pal. Take it from someone who knows—that is a dead-end street."
227,MICHAEL,And you think you know better than my father? One unimportant little man. What makes you think you get to choose?
227,DEAN,Because I got to believe that I can choose what I do with my unimportant little life.
227,MICHAEL,You're wrong. You know how I know?
227,MICHAEL,"Think of a million random acts of chance that let John and Mary be born, to meet, to fall in love, to have the two of you. Think of the million random choices that you make, and yet how each and every one of them brings you closer to your destiny. Do you know why that is? Because it's not random. It's not chance. It's a plan that is playing itself out perfectly. Free will's an illusion, Dean. That's why you're going to say yes. Oh, buck up. It could be worse. You know, unlike my brothers, I won't leave you a drooling mess when I'm done wearing you."
227,DEAN,"Well, what about my dad?"
227,MICHAEL,"Better than new. In fact, I'm gonna do your mom and your dad a favor."
227,DEAN,What?
227,MICHAEL,Scrub their minds. They won't remember me or you.
227,DEAN,You can't do that.
227,MICHAEL,"I'm just giving your mother what she wants. She can go back to her husband, her family—"
227,DEAN,She's gonna walk right into that nursery!
227,MICHAEL,Obviously.
227,MICHAEL,And you always knew that was going to play out one way or another.
227,MICHAEL,You can't fight City Hall.
227,MICHAEL,"He's home. Safe and sound. Your turn. I'll see you soon, Dean."
227,SAM,Castiel.
227,SAM,"Hey. Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
227,DEAN,Cas!
227,SAM,We got you.
227,DEAN,You son of a bitch. You made it.
227,CASTIEL,I...I did? I'm very surprised.
227,SAM,Whoa! You're okay.
227,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
227,DEAN,Bed?
227,SAM,"Yeah, yeah."
227,DEAN,"Well, I could use that drink now."
227,SAM,Yeah.
227,DEAN,Well...this is it.
227,SAM,This is what?
227,DEAN,"Team Free Will. One ex-blood junkie, one dropout with six bucks to his name, and Mr. Comatose over there. It's awesome."
227,SAM,It's not funny.
227,DEAN,I'm not laughing.
227,SAM,They all say we'll say yes.
227,DEAN,I know. It's getting annoying.
227,SAM,What if they're right?
227,DEAN,They're not.
227,SAM,"I mean, why, why would we, either of us? But...I've been weak before."
227,DEAN,Sam.
227,SAM,Michael got Dad to say yes.
227,DEAN,That was different. Anna was about to kill Mom.
227,SAM,And if you could save Mom...what would you say?
227,JOHN,Where'd you even get it?
227,MARY,Garage sale. Twenty-five cents.
227,JOHN,"Well, I'm glad to hear that, anyway."
227,MARY,Hey.
227,JOHN,"I mean, you really don't think it's just a...little cheesy?"
227,MARY,Mm-mm. I think it's sweet.
227,MARY,Can't even put my finger on why I like it. I just...like it.
227,JOHN,"Well, then, I love it."
227,MARY,"Ohh...quite a kick there. Troublemaker already. It's okay, baby. It's all okay. Angels are watching over you."
