239,SAM,Wow.
239,DEAN,"[ Reading a report. ] ""Suspect exited vehicle brandishing a firearm. We were forced to fire."""
239,SAM,"[ Imitating Castiel ] ""Hello."""
244,CROWLEY,"Crowley thinks you're just gonna what, Dean?"
244,CROWLEY,Is that Bobby Singer? Give him a kiss for me.
244,CROWLEY,"Good news, boys! I've got a job for you."
244,DEAN,I'm gonna say this once. You can take your job and shove it up your ass.
244,CROWLEY,Is that any way to talk to your boss?
244,DEAN,"You're not my boss, dickbag."
244,CROWLEY,"Dean, Dean. Been through this. Quit clutching your pearls. You've been working for me for some time now. Sam here, longer."
244,SAM,We didn't know.
244,CROWLEY,Like that makes a difference to you. You'd sell your brother for a dollar right now if you really needed a soda.
244,CROWLEY,"Look, I'm sending you –"
244,DEAN,No.
244,CROWLEY,Beg pardon?
244,DEAN,"I've done some shady stuff in my time, but I am not doing this. No."
244,CROWLEY,Ten quid says you will.
244,CROWLEY,"You like pain, Sam? You like Hell?"
244,CROWLEY,"You need to stop thinking of this as some kind of deal. This is a hostage situation, you arrogant little thug. I own your brother! Do you understand me?"
244,CROWLEY,"Come on, Dean, smile. It's not that bad. Here's incentive – you bag me a live alpha, and I'll give you little Sammy's soul back, with a cherry on top."
244,SAM,"What, alpha vamp not good enough for you?"
244,CROWLEY,"Best mind where you poke your nose, if you want to keep it. Your merry little hike up the food chain starts here."
244,CROWLEY,Businessman found dead in his car – chest ripped open...
244,CROWLEY,...heart missing. Sounds like?
244,SAM,Werewolf.
244,DEAN,"No, it's not a full moon."
244,CROWLEY,Werewolves turning on the full moon – so '09.
244,SAM,"He's right. Samuel and I ganked one about six months back on the half-moon. Things have been out of whack for a while now, I guess."
244,DEAN,"Yeah, I guess."
244,CROWLEY,"So, it's settled then. You bag the howler, bring it home to papa. See you soon, boys."
244,SAM,"So, the vic's a real class act. Owned a bunch of slum-grade apartments. Couple houses, too."
244,DEAN,So this is it? This is – this is what you're gonna do?
244,SAM,What am I doing?
244,DEAN,"Crowley. He's so far up our asses we're – we're – we're coughing sulfur, but you – you're just gonna work the case?"
244,SAM,"Well, he's got us by the short and curlies. What else are we supposed to do?"
244,DEAN,"It's just – you know, man, I... I'm working for a demon now. I don't even know who you are. I just... I just need a second to adjust."
244,SAM,"Look... this is a crap situation. I get it. But, Dean, I am still me – same melon, same memories. I-I still like the same music. I still think about Suzie Heizer."
244,DEAN,Biology class Suzie Heizer?
244,SAM,"Can you blame me? Look, I know you don't trust me. And I can't take back what I did. But I'm going to prove it to you. I'm still your brother."
244,DEAN,How you doing? Agents Holt and Wilson.
244,DETECTIVE,Feds?
244,SAM,Yeah.
244,DETECTIVE,What are the Feds doing here?
244,SAM,"Oh, we're specialists. They call us in to answer the questions of mouth-breathing dick monkeys."
244,SAM,"So, you gonna walk us through this, or, uh..."
244,DETECTIVE,Dock worker. Guy on the morning shift found him – chest ripped wide open.
244,DEAN,Same as the body in the car?
244,DETECTIVE,"Yeah, second one in two days."
244,SAM,Internal organs missing on both vics? Like their hearts?
244,DETECTIVE,"Uh... looks like it, yeah. How'd you know?"
244,SAM,"So, this guy, he – he have any enemies?"
244,DETECTIVE,"Yeah, plenty, but, uh, I don't think it was a wolf or possibly a cougar that had a beef with the guy. You do realize these were animal attacks?"
244,DEAN,"An animal out here. What, you think it came for the sailing?"
244,SAM,Morning.
244,DEAN,You didn't sleep. 'Cause you don't... sleep.
244,SAM,Right.
244,DEAN,Yeah. That's not creepy at all.
244,SAM,"Not like I can help it. So, you gonna just lay there staring at me..."
244,SAM,...or you want to hear what I dug up?
244,SAM,"All right. So, we know that werewolves are basically id gone wild, right? I mean, whoever they hate, they kill when they wolf out. So, I've been playing connect the victims."
244,DEAN,And?
244,SAM,And I think I found a common denominator. So come on. Uh...
244,SAM,"Get the lead out, huh?"
244,DEAN,"Let me get dressed, Robocop."
244,WOMAN,"Yes, can I help you?"
244,SAM,Is Cal Garrigan at home? We've got a few questions we'd like to ask him.
244,WOMAN,"[with a smile] Yeah. Um, come in."
244,WOMAN,"Honey, um, why don't you go play in your room for a little while, okay?"
244,WOMAN,Excuse the mess. Please sit.
244,WOMAN,Um... can I get you guys anything?
244,DEAN,"No, thank you. Um, so Cal is your boyfriend?"
244,WOMAN,That's right.
244,DEAN,And where is he?
244,WOMAN,"Uh, sleeping, I think."
244,DEAN,You mind telling him up and at 'em? He's got some guests.
244,WOMAN,"Yeah. Yeah, of course."
244,WOMAN,Cal...
244,CAL,"Lucky, shh!"
244,WOMAN,These are Agents...
244,DEAN,Holt and Wilson. Morning... ish.
244,CAL,Hey. What's this?
244,DEAN,"You out late last night, Cal?"
244,CAL,"Just, uh, you know, a couple beers with friends."
244,DEAN,How many's a couple?
244,CAL,"I don't know. Three, four tops."
244,SAM,"If all you had was beer, then how come you're sweating vodka? And looks to me like you slept in those clothes. Am I right?"
244,CAL,I don't know. I – I guess.
244,DEAN,"So what you're saying is, you got blind drunk, you blacked out. Something tells me this isn't the first time."
244,SAM,"So, Cal, truthfully, who knows what you've really been up to at night?"
244,CAL,"Look, what's this about?"
244,SAM,We're investigating the death of Ronald Garrigan.
244,CAL,My brother?
244,DEAN,Sorry for your loss.
244,CAL,"Yeah, I thought that was some kind of animal attack."
244,SAM,"No love lost between the two of you, huh?"
244,CAL,"Look, we had our differences, I guess. You love your brother, of course, but... Ron had a lot of problems. He was, uh, volatile."
244,SAM,"Last time he was here, you called the cops?"
244,CAL,"Yeah, look, he came in here all messed up, and he was yelling. He shoved Mandy. So, yeah, I called the cops. I don't see how that has to do with –"
244,SAM,Your landlord was found dead this week. Were you aware of that?
244,CAL,Saw it in the papers. Why?
244,SAM,"Well, you two were pretty far behind on your rent, right? He had sent eviction papers?"
244,MANDY,I – I'm sorry. That was an animal attack.
244,SAM,"Funny enough, yeah – both of 'em were."
244,CAL,"So, great, great. Yeah, guys. What in the hell do you think I had to do with 'em?"
244,DEAN,Just following procedure. Had to ask. You two have a good day.
244,SAM,"So, Cal's a prince."
244,DEAN,"Yeah, doesn't even know where he was last night."
244,SAM,Bag him now?
244,DEAN,No. We make sure.
244,SAM,Really?
244,DEAN,"Before we hand him over to a lifetime of demon rape? Yeah, really."
244,SAM,"Boy, Cal just doesn't know when to quit."
244,DEAN,"Three scuzzy bars, one scuzzy strip club, a chili-dog joint, seven or eight nightcaps, and now... scotches in the library. I'm getting cirrhosis just watching this. Other than that, we got squat."
244,SAM,Let's just see.
244,DEAN,"Dude, sun's up."
244,DEAN,This guy's still on two legs. In theory. He ain't wolfing out.
244,SAM,"Well, not tonight, anyway."
244,DEAN,Let's head back. We can re-attack this in a couple hours.
244,CAL,"Catch you later, man."
244,CAL,Lucky. What are you doing?
244,CAL,No!
244,CAL,No!
244,MANDY,"Oh, ew, Lucky, that's enough. [calls out] Cal? [more quietly] Typical."
244,MANDY,"Oh, Lucky. Honestly."
244,MANDY,You are the only decent boyfriend I have ever had.
244,DEAN,I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that it's not Cal.
244,SAM,"Masterful deduction, Sherlock."
244,DEAN,"I mean, a werewolf attack in daylight? This whole thing is just weird."
244,SAM,"Dogs and cats living together – mass hysteria. So, you know this means that we're down to one suspect, right?"
244,DEAN,I know.
244,SAM,"I mean, Mandy is right at the deep end of the vic pool. Can you do it?"
244,DEAN,Do what?
244,SAM,"Shove her in the trunk, serve her up to Crowley."
244,DEAN,"Yeah, Sam, I can do it."
244,MANDY,"You still feeling hot, baby?"
244,MANDY,"Here, have some juice. Make you feel better."
244,MANDY,"Hey, see? Lucky knows you're not feeling well, and he wants you to feel better."
244,MANDY,"He loves you, doesn't he? There's a good boy."
244,MANDY,There's a good boy.
244,MANDY,Yeah.
244,MANDY,Uh-oh.
244,MANDY,"Lucky, look what you did!"
244,MANDY,"What, am I interrupting the morning show? Come on. Let's go for a walk."
244,MANDY,"Hey, is that blood? Have you killed a bird again? Bad dog!"
244,WOMAN,Three o’clock? Does that work?
244,MANDY,Okay.
244,WOMAN,Okay.
244,MANDY,See you later.
244,WOMAN,See you then.
244,GIRL,Bye.
244,MANDY,Bye.
244,DEAN,Ma'am.
244,MANDY,Agents. What are you doing here?
244,DEAN,Nobody called you?
244,MANDY,Called me about what?
244,MANDY,I'm sorry. I just can't believe it.
244,DEAN,I'm really very sorry.
244,SAM,"Ma'am, I know this isn't the best time, but we'd like you to come with us."
244,MANDY,Why? You think I have something to do with this? With Cal?
244,DEAN,"Of course not. We just got a few questions – i's and t's, mostly."
244,MANDY,"I, uh... Could we do it later?"
244,SAM,I'm afraid not.
244,MANDY,"Oh. Uh – uh, my kid has the flu, um, and he was up all night, so –"
244,SAM,"Well, is there a neighbor or a friend who can watch him while you're gone?"
244,DEAN,I'm sorry. You said your boy was up all night?
244,MANDY,"Uh, yeah."
244,DEAN,Were you with him all night?
244,MANDY,"Um – uh – well, I had, um, half an hour of sleep, maybe."
244,DEAN,Can I talk to your son?
244,MANDY,Why?
244,SAM,"Yeah, what difference does that make, Agent Holt?"
244,DEAN,[to SAM] Trust me. It's important. [to MANDY] Please?
244,DEAN,"Well, it wasn't her."
244,SAM,You don't know that.
244,DEAN,She's got an alibi.
244,SAM,She's lying.
244,DEAN,"You heard the kid, dude. She's not lying."
244,SAM,"Fine. She still had time to wolf out, Dean. The last werewolf was in bed, with me, and she wolfed out."
244,DEAN,"Don't make this personal. Look, all I'm saying is that between this and the daylight attacks, something's not adding up."
244,DEAN,I'm not just gonna hand her over to Crowley until we figure out what. You understand?
244,SAM,"Okay. Okay. I understand. How 'bout you go check out Cal's crime scene, see if we're missing anything. I'll come back and keep an eye on Amanda."
244,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, how 'bout you go and I'll stay here?"
244,SAM,"Dean, I still know how to do my job. I'm just gonna watch her. That's all. Trust me."
244,DEAN,Uh-huh.
244,MAN,It’s okay.
244,WOMAN,It’s okay.
244,MAN,"It’ll be okay, boy."
244,WOMAN,Oh...
244,MAN,We gotta find a vet.
244,WOMAN,"Hurry, hurry!"
244,SAM,Hey!
244,SAM,"Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait! Mister! Hey, mister, wait! That's my dog!"
244,SAM,That's my dog.
244,DEAN,"Hiya, Lucky. Bad dog."
244,DEAN,First things first.
244,DEAN,You see this? This is silver. Don't say I didn't warn you.
244,DEAN,"Okay, time to go. Now, we can either do this the easy way –"
244,DEAN,Hmm?
244,DEAN,Or the hard way.
244,SAM,"What? Soul or not, that's funny."
244,SAM,"Well, I got to tell you, Lucky, you got us stumped. I mean, why shack up with the family? Is it a kinky thing? Do you like to play with your food? Roll over, Lucky. Speak."
244,SAM,"Already been. Didn't agree with me. So, look..."
244,SAM,"...how about I take this silver knife, and start carving some dog until you behave?"
244,DEAN,"Hang on, Sam. [to LUCKY (MAN)] Listen, you don't have to tell me why you're with the family. I get it."
244,DEAN,"You killed every threat that came near them. You care about them, in your own whack-a-doodle kind of way. It's obvious. What I want to know is, who was that guy you were kibitzing with? He a skinwalker, too?"
244,DEAN,"But if you don't, then you're gonna put the girl and the little boy in danger. And sooner or later, all this crap is gonna come for them. Now, look –"
244,DEAN,We don't give a rat's ass about you. We want to help them. That's our angle. That's it.
244,SAM,How many are you?
244,SAM,Recruited?
244,DEAN,"Sniffing people's butts? Yeah, that's a real step up."
244,DEAN,Where is this little Scooby gang of yours?
244,DEAN,"""Lay low""? What the hell's that mean?"
244,DEAN,What word?
244,DEAN,"God, you're a sleeper cell."
244,SAM,So you're waiting for word from who? Who organized you?
244,SAM,Your Alpha?
244,SAM,"The – the first skinwalker, the strongest."
244,DEAN,Fantastic. Then you can help us stop him.
244,DEAN,"Yes, you can."
244,DEAN,"Sam, not helping."
244,DEAN,Listen to me.
244,DEAN,"What are you gonna do to that family, really? You gonna put your jaws around that little boy's throat? Clamp down, listen to him cry for his mom? 'Cause I'm gonna guess that these are the only people who in your pathetic life have ever showed you any kindness. So it's either that... or you can help us stop it."
244,SAM,So... How are we supposed to get near something that can smell us a hundred yards off?
244,DEAN,We don't.
244,SAM,The pack leader. We're taking him down?
244,DEAN,Yeah. Got a better idea?
244,SAM,"No, I... Crowley's not gonna be too happy about that."
244,DEAN,"Who gives a rat's ass? We let that thing live one second, and it sends out that psychic dog whistle and [hand motions] phew!"
244,SAM,"On the other hand, it could lead us to an Alpha. Then Crowley would give me my soul back."
244,DEAN,Are you kidding? 150 people turned into monsters. That's what you want?
244,SAM,No. Of course not. I... I'm just asking.
244,DEAN,"All right, you know what? That's it."
244,SAM,What?
244,DEAN,"You say you're ""just folks,"" yeah? That – that you like baseball and apple pie or whatever. But truth is, I don't know what you are 'cause you're not Sam."
244,SAM,"Dean, come on."
244,DEAN,"I mean, it's your gigantor body and – and maybe your brain, but it's not you. So just... stop pretending. Do us both a favor."
244,SAM,"He looks nervous, right?"
244,DEAN,Wouldn't you be?
244,SAM,"I'd double-cross us. I mean, he's got to realize that's his best bet, if he wants to keep breathing."
244,DEAN,"Nah, he'll go through with it."
244,SAM,You mean 'cause he loves that family?
244,DEAN,Yeah.
244,SAM,I'd double-cross us.
244,DEAN,"Thanks, Dexter. That's reassuring."
244,SAM,Just making conversation.
244,DEAN,Here we go.
244,SAM,"That big guy, the driver – that's the guy Lucky met in the park."
244,DEAN,And there's El Jefe.
244,SAM,Take him out.
244,DEAN,It's not clean. We got one shot at this – literally.
244,SAM,Take the shot.
244,DEAN,I'm trying! She's in the way.
244,SAM,Take it anyway!
244,DEAN,"Come on, come on, come on. Ahh."
244,SAM,"So, plan B?"
244,DEAN,We've got one?
244,MANDY,"Please, whatever you want. Just please let my son go."
244,MANDY,There – there's been a mistake. T-This has got nothing to do with us.
244,MANDY,"Oh, my..."
244,MANDY,It's okay.
244,MANDY,Who are you? I don't even know you!
244,SAM,Dean!
244,MANDY,But I don't –
244,MANDY,"Here, baby, go under here. Okay, stay there, honey. You'll be safe."
244,MANDY,Lucky?!
244,MANDY,"Get away from this house, you psycho. And if you ever, ever come near me or my son again, so help me..."
244,DEAN,"I'll never look at a dog the same. Makes you wonder, though, huh?"
244,SAM,What?
244,DEAN,"How many packs are out there. What if they're all just waiting for the signal, you know?"
244,SAM,So...I was thinking. You were right.
244,DEAN,About?
244,SAM,I'm not your brother. I'm not Sam.
244,DEAN,Okay.
244,SAM,"Um, all that ""Blah, blah, blah,"" about being the old me? Crap. Like Lisa and Ben, right? I've been acting like I care about them. But I don't. I couldn't care less."
244,DEAN,Is this supposed to make me feel better?
244,SAM,"You wanted the real me. This is it. I don't care about them. I don't even really care about you. Except that... I need your help. And you're clearly not gonna stick around for much longer unless I give it to you straight, so... I've done a lot worse than you know. I've killed innocent people in the line of duty. But I'm pretty sure it's not something the old me could've done. And maybe I should feel guilty. But I don't."
244,DEAN,"Sam, get to the punch line."
244,SAM,"I don't know if how I am is better or worse. It's different. You get the job done, and nothing really hurts. That's not the worst thing. But I've been thinking. And it was... it was kinda harder. But there are also things about it I remember that I... Let's just say I think I should probably go back to being him."
244,DEAN,That's very interesting. It's a step.
244,SAM,So?
244,DEAN,We do what we got to do. And we get my brother back.
248,SAM,"Hey, Dean. It's me."
248,LISA,I need you to go.
248,STAN,How you doing?
248,PENNY,I'm great. This is great.
248,STAN,"Penny, it's gonna be okay. You know, a lot more people die in the shower."
248,PENNY,Good to know. Thanks.
248,STAN,"I didn't think we'd run into any weather, though."
248,PENNY,"Look, can we just land? Please?"
248,STAN,Couple minutes. All right? We're close. I'm sorry.
248,PENNY,What was that?!
248,STAN,What?
248,PENNY,Something just flew by the window! It was huge!
248,STAN,"Probably just a bird, okay?"
248,PENNY,"No! No, Stan, that was not a bird."
248,STAN,"Well, then, what was it?"
248,PENNY,I don't know.
248,STAN,"Penny, there's nothing out there. I promise. Hey, just close your eyes, okay? It's okay. Just lean back. Try to relax. Think of someplace nice. Waves on a beach."
248,PENNY,Stan?!
248,PENNY,"Oh! Oh, my God! No, no, no, no, no, no!"
248,DEAN,Well?
248,CASTIEL,His soul is in place.
248,DEAN,Is he ever gonna wake up?
248,CASTIEL,"I'm not a human doctor, Dean."
248,DEAN,Could you take a guess?
248,CASTIEL,Okay. Probably not.
248,DEAN,"Oh, well, don't sugarcoat it."
248,CASTIEL,"I'm sorry, Dean, but I warned you not to put that thing back inside him."
248,DEAN,"What was I supposed to do? Let T-1000 walk around, hope he doesn't open fire?"
248,CASTIEL,"Let me tell you what his soul felt like when I touched it. Like it had been skinned alive, Dean. If you wanted to kill your brother, you should have done it
outright."
248,BOBBY,"Like my daddy always said, just 'cause it kills your liver don't mean it ain't medicine."
248,BOBBY,Sam still asleep?
248,DEAN,Yeah.
248,BOBBY,He'll wake up.
248,DEAN,Yeah.
248,BOBBY,"Dean, he's been through how much?"
248,BOBBY,"Somehow, he always bounces back."
248,DEAN,He's never been through this.
248,DEAN,Job?
248,BOBBY,Might be.
248,DEAN,Can I help? Send me to the library? Anything?
248,BOBBY,Couple goes up in a light plane. Wreckage was just found in the woods.
248,DEAN,Couple of Buddy Hollys?
248,DEAN,Doesn't really seem like News of the Weird.
248,BOBBY,"Pilot was found seventeen miles away, flambéed."
248,BOBBY,"Girl's just gone. No body, no nothing."
248,DEAN,"Okay, I'm not changing the channel."
248,SAM,Dean.
248,DEAN,Sam?
248,BOBBY,Good to see you.
248,SAM,Wait. I saw you—I—I felt Lucifer snap your neck.
248,BOBBY,"Well, Cas kind of—"
248,SAM,Cas is alive?
248,DEAN,"Yeah, Cas—Cas is fine. Sam, are you okay?"
248,SAM,"Actually, um...I'm starving."
248,DEAN,"So, Sam..."
248,SAM,Yeah?
248,DEAN,What's the last thing you remember?
248,SAM,The field. And then I fell.
248,DEAN,Okay. And then?
248,SAM,I woke up in the panic room.
248,BOBBY,That's it? You really don't remember—
248,DEAN,Let's be glad. Who wants to remember all that hell?
248,SAM,"Well, how long was I gone?"
248,DEAN,About a year and a half.
248,SAM,"What? I was downstairs f— I don't remember anything. So, how'd I get back? Was it Cas?"
248,DEAN,Not exactly.
248,SAM,"Dean, what did you do?"
248,DEAN,Me and Death—
248,SAM,Death?! The horseman?
248,DEAN,I had leverage. It's done.
248,SAM,You sure?
248,DEAN,It's over. Slate's wiped.
248,BOBBY,"Well, isn't this just neat and clean?"
248,DEAN,"Yes, it is—for once."
248,SAM,Is there anything else I should know?
248,DEAN,No. Another beer?
248,SAM,"Uh, yeah."
248,DEAN,Hey.
248,BOBBY,How is he?
248,DEAN,"He's, uh...He's good. Really good. Better than I could have hoped."
248,BOBBY,Uh-huh.
248,DEAN,What? Why the poopface?
248,BOBBY,I'm glad he's better. I really am. But... That kid went straight-up Menendez on me not ten days ago. And now it's all just...erased? Sorry. I'm having a bit of a hard time even looking at him.
248,DEAN,It wasn't Sam.
248,DEAN,"Well, what do you want to do, Bobby? We tell him everything?"
248,BOBBY,"No. Just wish I could, that's all."
248,DEAN,"Yeah, but if we start throwing that crap at him, we don't know what's gonna happen. It could—it could crack the wall."
248,BOBBY,I know. I know.
248,DEAN,"So, you know what? As far as I'm concerned, it's a gift horse, and I'm not looking for teeth. I'm sending Death a damn fruit basket."
248,BOBBY,"He's gonna find out, you know. One way or another, someone'll tell him, or he'll figure it out on his own. He's not dumb. He should it hear it from us."
248,DEAN,"Can we just leave it alone for the moment, please?"
248,BOBBY,Sam still asleep?
248,DEAN,"Yeah, let him rest. We'll call him later."
248,SAM,Call me from where?
248,DEAN,"Oh. Uh, there's this thing
in Oregon."
248,SAM,Great. I'm in.
248,DEAN,"Whoa, whoa. You just got vertical."
248,SAM,Exactly. I'm up. I'm good.
248,DEAN,"Well, a few more days of crap cable couldn't hurt."
248,DEAN,"All right. You, me, and Bobby."
248,BOBBY,"Oh, you two go on ahead. You got this covered. I, uh, forgot I promised that idjit Rufus I'd work the phones for him, so..."
248,DEAN,You sure?
248,BOBBY,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. You two enjoy catching up,
okay?"
248,SAM,What was that?
248,DEAN,"One part age, three parts liquor."
248,SAM,"Uh, you got it, officer. Thank you. You too."
248,SAM,"So, get this—besides the crash, there were two other disappearances in town this week."
248,DEAN,Really?
248,SAM,"Yeah, last weekend, a college girl vanished
from her apartment. On the seventeenth floor. Then, three days ago, another girl didn't make it home from school."
248,DEAN,They know each other?
248,SAM,"No. No connection. Just young and female, like the plane-crash girl."
248,DEAN,"What would disappear a girl out of the sky, anyway?"
248,SAM,Good question.
248,SAM,"So you never even tried, huh?"
248,DEAN,Tried?
248,SAM,"To go live a life...after. You do remember you promised that, right?"
248,DEAN,"Yeah, I remember."
248,SAM,"So, why didn't you try?"
248,DEAN,What makes you think I didn't?
248,SAM,'Cause look at you. Look at this. You're exactly the same.
248,DEAN,"Yeah, you're probably right."
248,DEAN,I was with them for a year—Lisa and Ben.
248,SAM,A year?
248,SAM,So then what?
248,DEAN,Didn't work out.
248,DEAN,"You're, uh...Penny Dessertine's sister, right?"
248,SAM,"Uh, we'd just like to ask you a few questions."
248,SAM,"I—I understand. Really, I do. I know how hard this must be. We'd just like to figure out what happened. This will be quick. I promise."
248,DEAN,"What, like flying through a lightning storm in a two-seater?"
248,SAM,Stan?
248,SAM,Hey.
248,DEAN,What do you got?
248,SAM,"Uh...Well, looks like those other two missing girls both baked cookies for the lord."
248,DEAN,What is that? Code?
248,SAM,"No. Church choir, bake sales, promise-ring clubs—the works. They were good girls. But Penny wasn't even a Christian, so—"
248,DEAN,I have another theory. Penny's diary.
248,SAM,Did you steal that from her room?
248,DEAN,I love that you even asked me that.
248,SAM,And why wouldn't I?
248,DEAN,"No reason. So girl-nappings. What if it's not about religion, what if it's about purity?"
248,SAM,You mean you think they're all—
248,DEAN,"Virgins, Sam. Virgins."
248,SAM,Penny was twenty-two.
248,DEAN,"Yeah, with a pink room."
248,SAM,So?
248,DEAN,And stuffed teddy bears.
248,SAM,Fine. But you really think—
248,DEAN,"""I've decided I'm going to give Stan my most precious gift."""
248,SAM,Wow. That sounded really creepy coming out of your mouth.
248,DEAN,I think I delivered it.
248,SAM,"You know, you—you could have led with 'the diary'. You know? Anyways, let's say you're right. Fine. Who would want virgins?"
248,DEAN,You got me. I prefer ladies with experience.
248,MELISSA,Aaaaaaaah!
248,MELISSA,It happened so fast.
248,SAM,"It's all right, Melissa. What came at you? You can tell us."
248,MELISSA,"It—it looked like a...a giant bat. You think I'm making it up, right? That's what the other man said."
248,SAM,"Well, I'm not the other man."
248,MELISSA,It came right at me. It was huge. I swear. That's how I got this.
248,SAM,"So, it attacked. And then what happened?"
248,MELISSA,"I don't know. I passed out, and when I woke up, it was gone."
248,SAM,"Is there anything else you can think of? Anything you can tell us, even if it doesn't seem
important?"
248,MELISSA,"Well, my ring got lost. Or else that thing stole it, if that makes any sense."
248,DEAN,What kind of ring?
248,MELISSA,Gold. Promise ring.
248,MELISSA,Yeah. Why?
248,DEAN,"I got to ask. Uh, Melissa... Look, nobody is, uh, judging anybody here, okay? Believe me. But...Should you really be wearing that ring?"
248,MELISSA,"Well, I-I mean, I-I am—"
248,DEAN,Really?
248,MELISSA,Matt Barne didn't count!
248,SAM,"So, what, you think Batman tried to rape her?"
248,DEAN,"Well, he does carry a lot of rage. But he rejected her because she was already dehymenated, huh?"
248,SAM,You think?
248,DEAN,I think it just goes to show that being easy's pretty much all upside.
248,SAM,"So, what kind of thing likes virgins and gold?"
248,DEAN,P. Diddy?
248,SAM,"You know, it's comforting."
248,DEAN,What's that?
248,SAM,"I died for a year, came back, and you're still not funny."
248,DEAN,Shut up. I'm hilarious.
248,SAM,This can't be possible.
248,DEAN,Try me.
248,SAM,"Um, I googled ""fire,"" ""claws,"" ""flying,"" ""stealing virgins,"" and ""gold,"" and it all takes me
to the same place."
248,DEAN,Where?
248,DEAN,I don't know what that means.
248,SAM,"Dragons, dude. See? Told you. Not possible."
248,DEAN,"Actually, it might be."
248,SAM,How? In what reality?
248,DEAN,It's been a strange year. We should get a second opinion.
248,BOBBY,Yeah?
248,DEAN,What do you know about dragons?
248,BOBBY,What? Nothing.
248,DEAN,Seriously.
248,BOBBY,"Well, they're not like the Loch Ness monster, Dean. Dragons aren't real."
248,DEAN,Could you make a few calls?
248,BOBBY,To who? Hogwarts?
248,DEAN,Humor me.
248,BOBBY,Fine.
248,DEAN,You're a gentleman and a scholar.
248,DEAN,Everything's fine. Sam says hey.
248,SAM,You okay?
248,DEAN,Yeah.
248,SAM,Bobby say anything?
248,DEAN,Nope.
248,SAM,"Hey, did we hunt a skinwalker lately?"
248,DEAN,Doesn't ring a bell. Why?
248,SAM,I don't know. Just...déjà vu or something. Are you sure? I could have sworn—
248,DEAN,"You got to remember, your eggs are still a little scrambled, right? But, yeah, I'm sure."
248,SAM,All right. Yeah. Never mind.
248,DEAN,"Hey, Bobby. What do you got?"
248,BOBBY,"Can't believe she didn't jump right to mind. Dr. Visyak. Medieval Studies, S.F.U."
248,DEAN,"Dr. Visyak, S.F.U. Got it. Thanks. All right. I'm going to San Francisco, figure out how to kill these things. You figure out where they are."
248,SAM,W-wait. D-did Bobby say where they like to park?
248,DEAN,No.
248,SAM,Great. Back to the lore.
248,DEAN,Which says what? That they live in Middle-Earth?
248,SAM,No. Caves.
248,DEAN,You're such a nerd.
248,GIRL,Please let me go! Please! No! Aah! No!
248,PENNY,It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
248,DEAN,Dr. Visyak. My name is Dean Winchester.
248,DEAN,Bobby Singer sent me. Hello? Hi.
248,DEAN,Hmm?
248,DEAN,"No love lost between you two, huh?"
248,DEAN,Oh?
248,DEAN,"Well, uh...Dragons."
248,DEAN,"What, no twelve-sided-dice joke?"
248,DEAN,"Well, one just flew in stateside."
248,DEAN,Fits the lore to a tee.
248,DEAN,"Banner crop of crazy all the way around these days, doc."
248,DEAN,That's right.
248,DEAN,Uh... Okay. What kind of blade?
248,DEAN,"So you need one to kill one, but you got to kill one to make one. How does that work out?"
248,DEAN,"You know a lot about this stuff, don't you?"
248,DEAN,You have one.
248,DEAN,That is not real. Is that real? Is it Excalibur?
248,DEAN,"So, uh, what's with the cement shoe?"
248,DEAN,"All right, well, how do we get this puppy out?"
248,DEAN,"Right. All right, well, I'll, uh, give it a whirl. Do you mind?"
248,DEAN,Never better.
248,DEAN,"Oh, son of a bitch! That's really on there!"
248,DEAN,"Well, I have another idea."
248,DEAN,"Well, you're not gonna like it."
248,BOBBY,Sam. Where's Dean?
248,SAM,"Hey, um...He went to go see your friend. So, look, I'm trying to figure out where this thing lairs up. Uh, little help, maybe?"
248,BOBBY,What are the parameters?
248,SAM,"Caves, basically. But there's nothing around for miles."
248,BOBBY,"So, less literal, then. What else you got local that's cold, dark, and wet?"
248,SAM,"Huh. Well, um...There's no subway lines. Sewers. That could be it. Thanks."
248,BOBBY,All right.
248,SAM,"Wait, Bobby. Wait. Um...You okay?"
248,BOBBY,"Yeah, of course. Why? What's wrong?"
248,SAM,Besides the way you been acting and talking? Nothing. Is there something I should know?
248,BOBBY,No. All you need to know is where Godzilla's holed up.
248,SAM,"Well, Bobby, what happened this last year?"
248,BOBBY,"It had its moments. No more than usual. It's got nothing to do with you, Sam. How could it?"
248,SAM,Right. 'Course.
248,BOBBY,Call me if you need anything.
248,SAM,"Castiel, um...I'm back. So, if you got a minute..."
248,CASTIEL,Sam. It's so good to see you alive.
248,SAM,Yeah. You too.
248,CASTIEL,—that would be awkward.
248,SAM,"Um...Was a crazy year, huh? I-I-I just talked to Bobby. He—he told me everything that happened."
248,CASTIEL,"Frankly, I'm surprised that you survived. I was begging Dean not to do it."
248,SAM,"Yeah. No, I-I-I can understand that."
248,CASTIEL,"You know, it's a miracle it didn't kill you."
248,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, it's a miracle, all right."
248,CASTIEL,"So, how does it feel?"
248,SAM,What?
248,CASTIEL,"Well, to have your soul back, of course."
248,SAM,"Right. Y-you mean 'cause I was walking around with no soul. Uh... Really good, Cas.
I'm real good. You know what? I'm—I'm just hazy on a few of the details, though. Um...
You think maybe you could...walk me through?"
248,DEAN,"It's also the only weapon we got. Look, I know what I'm doing, okay? I actually learned it all from Bobby. Hey, whatever happened there, you know he's at least a genius at this.
Do you want me to kill that dragon or not?"
248,DEAN,Trust me.
248,DEAN,"You rocks think you're so smart. All right. Welcome to the 21st century. All right, stand back."
248,DEAN,Okay. Now...
248,DEAN,"You've got insurance for this, right?"
248,SAM,"And what are we supposed to do with this, Dean? Give it a booster shot?"
248,DEAN,It's what we got. All right? We're just gonna have to get a little closer. That's all. Where are we on the caves?
248,SAM,"Nowhere. Sewers, on the other hand...Here. Check this out."
248,SAM,"So, two of the disappearances happened within a mile of here. So I think we start there and work our way around."
248,DEAN,Awesome. Who doesn't love sewers? Let's go.
248,DEAN,What?
248,SAM,"Nothing. Uh, yeah, let's go."
248,DEAN,"Ugh! God. Just when I get used to a smell, I hit a new flavor. Dude, we have been here
for hours. There is nothing. I think the lore is off. Hey, what if, uh...What if dragons like
nice hotels?"
248,SAM,What is that?
248,DEAN,What?
248,DEAN,Holy crap.
248,DEAN,"Okay, maybe there are dragons here."
248,SAM,Wait. Dean...Not now. Check this out.
248,SAM,"A little arts-and-crafty for a giant bat, right?"
248,PENNY,Hello? Is someone there? Hello?
248,DEAN,Hey. We're gonna get you out.
248,PENNY,Quick. He's coming back.
248,DRAGON,Where do you think you're gonna stick that?
248,DRAGON,Aah! Where did you get that?
248,DEAN,Comic-Con.
248,DRAGON,Aah!
248,DEAN,"Hey, Sam. Ask me what time it is."
248,SAM,Why don't you cut to the chase and just roll in it?
248,DEAN,I rarely have wealth.
248,SAM,Dean...
248,DEAN,Yeah?
248,SAM,I am so...so sorry. I can't even begin to say.
248,DEAN,For what?
248,SAM,You know what.
248,DEAN,Did Bobby...
248,SAM,Cas.
248,DEAN,Cas. Friggin' child.
248,SAM,"You should have told me, Dean."
248,DEAN,You weren't supposed to know.
248,SAM,What I did? To Bobby? To you? Of course I should know.
248,DEAN,"Sam, Death didn't just shove your soul back in, okay? He put up the great wall of Sam between you and the things that you don't remember. And trust me when I say that the things you don't know could kill you. That's not a joke."
248,SAM,"All right. But I have to set things right. Or what I can, anyway."
248,DEAN,It wasn't you.
248,SAM,"You know, I kind of feel like I got slipped the worst mickey of all time...and I woke up to find out that I had burnt the whole city down. And you can say it wasn't me, but...I'm the one with the zippo in my pocket, you know? So I'm not sure it's that cut and dry. And, look, I a-appreciate you trying to protect me. I really do. But I got to fix... What I got to fix. So I need to know what I did."
248,DEAN,But you don't know how dangerous that could be.
248,SAM,What would you do? Right. Same thing.
248,DEAN,Sam...
248,BOBBY,"Boys, something I think you ought to see."
248,BOBBY,"Now, as near as I can figure it, this dates back around the fourteenth century."
248,SAM,What language is it?
248,BOBBY,"Da Vinci code. Real obscure Latinate. Gonna take me my golden years to translate it all.
Oh, and, uh, FYI—that ain't paper."
248,DEAN,What is it?
248,BOBBY,It's human skin. Okay. I'm fairly clear on this first bit. It basically describes this place. It's like the backside of your worst nightmares. It's all blood and bone and darkness.
248,BOBBY,"Filled with the bodies and souls of all things hungry, sharp, and nasty."
248,SAM,Monsters?
248,BOBBY,"It's monsterland. According to this, it goes by many names, most of which I can't pronounce, but I'm thinking you know Purgatory."
248,DEAN,"Purgatory? Awesome. Well, that is good to know. So, you're saying that these, uh, dragon freaks were squatting in the sewers and reading tone poems about purgatory?"
248,BOBBY,"Oh, no, no, no. They're reading an instruction manual."
248,DEAN,What?
248,BOBBY,"Yeah. If you're nuts enough to want access to a place that gnarly, this book will show you how to open a door."
248,DEAN,"Door to purgatory. Well, I know a demon who would have loved to have known about that. So, how do you open the door?"
248,BOBBY,Ask Cloverfield. I'm pretty sure he's got that page.
248,GIRL,Let me go! Please stop!
248,GIRL,No! Please don't!
248,DRAGON,Huc sine mora debeas mater!
248,BOBBY,It gets worse.
248,SAM,Worse?
248,BOBBY,This ain't talking about how to take a vacation over there. This is all about opening a door to let something in.
248,SAM,Bring something here. What?
248,BOBBY,I'm working on it.
248,DEAN,Could you give us something?
248,BOBBY,I got a name.
248,DEAN,Okay.
248,BOBBY,Mother.
248,SAM,Mother? M-mother of what? Mother of dragons?
248,BOBBY,I wish. It says it a few times here. Mother of all.
248,DEAN,"What the hell does ""mother of all"" mean?"
248,BOBBY,I don't know.
249,SAMUEL,You okay?
249,SAM,Yeah.
249,SAMUEL,How's the arm?
249,SAM,It'll hold till we get out of town.
249,SAMUEL,"Just don't bleed out, all right?"
249,SAM,"Yeah, well, that's the plan."
249,SAMUEL,Cop.
249,SAMUEL,"Evening, Deputy."
249,SAMUEL,We're just on our way to the office. Everything okay?
249,SAMUEL,"We spoke to Dobbs earlier. Maybe he's just, uh—"
249,SAMUEL,"Hey, look, there's no need to get riled."
249,SAMUEL,All right. We'll follow you back.
249,SAM,You're gonna arrest two federal agents? Really? (laughs) Have a good night. (Sam turns away)
249,SAMUEL,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, just hold—"
249,SAMUEL,You think there were maybe calmer ways we could have done all that?
249,SAM,Do we care? Let's go.
249,DEAN,What are you watching?
249,SAM,"Just trying to catch up. So...Mel Gibson really took a turn this past year, huh?"
249,DEAN,"Or he's possessed. Seriously, think about it. So, I just got off the blower with Bobby."
249,SAM,"Oh, yeah? You got anything else on this, uh, 'Mother of All' thing?"
249,DEAN,"Uh, no, nothing solid. He says it's quiet."
249,SAM,Quiet like quiet or quiet like too quiet?
249,DEAN,When is it ever just quiet?
249,SAM,Right. (Sam checks his cell phone and sees he has received a text message of coordinates) Hmm.
249,DEAN,"What? What are these, coordinates? Who's it from?"
249,SAM,"I have no idea.
(Sam looks the coordinates up on a map)"
249,DEAN,Well?
249,SAM,"Uh, Bristol, Rhode Island, where three women disappeared in the last week. Apparently, the, uh, victims seemed to vanish into thin air."
249,DEAN,Could be something. Who's the text from?
249,SAM,I don't know. It just kept ringing.
249,DEAN,What's that about?
249,SAM,"Could be another hunter looking for backup, throwing us a case? Who knows how many hunters I even met, working with the Campbells, you know? But I think we should go."
249,DEAN,"Whoa, wait. We're just gonna drop everything?"
249,SAM,"Dude, two minutes ago, you weren't doing anything."
249,DEAN,"You got mysterious coordinates from a mysterious Mr. ""X,"" leading to a mysterious town? That doesn't throw up red flags to you?"
249,SAM,I don't know. Maybe. But that doesn't mean we can just ignore a bunch of missing girls. Right?
249,DEAN,"Okay. We'll check it out. But if things get squirrelly, we dump out, okay?"
249,SAM,Yeah.
249,DEAN,What?
249,SAM,Nothing.
249,DEAN,"(looking through missing persons leaflets) Well, freak's got a type—brunettes. Whoa. This one's got a little bit of a wild side. It's all in the eyes, Sam. See it?"
249,SAM,"All right, well, aside from your little deep insight there, these women actually have nothing in common—different jobs, different friends, different everything. So, what's the connection?"
249,DEAN,"I don't know. Why don't you figure that out? I'm gonna go hit the poop deck. (Dean heads to the bathroom, marked with the sign 'poop deck')"
249,WOMAN,(approaches Sam)Agent Roark? It's good to see you again.
249,SAM,It is.
249,WOMAN,"Oh, you remember my husband? (gestures to her husband)"
249,SAM,Right.
249,WOMAN,Don.
249,SAM,"Of course, right. Um, hi."
249,WOMAN,"So, you're back 'cause it started again, right—the disappearances?"
249,SAM,"Uh, yeah. Yeah, right. Um...So, if either of you two hear anything, please let me know."
249,WOMAN,"Where's your partner? The big bald guy? Agent Wynand, right?"
249,SAM,"Agent Wynand, of course. Well—"
249,DEAN,"Sex rehab. Yeah, you've heard of plushies, right?"
249,DEAN,"Hi. Pleasure.(shakes woman's hand) How you doing? Hi.(shakes Don's hand) Uh, so, Agent, we should, uh—"
249,SAM,"Yeah. Yeah, of course."
249,WOMAN,"Of course. Uh, nice chatting with you, Agent Roark."
249,SAM,You too.
249,WOMAN,(in Sam's memory) Cuff me.
249,DEAN,What was that? She just cougar-eyed you.
249,SAM,I think Samuel and I have worked a case in this town.
249,DEAN,"You think? (Dean shows Sam a polaroid he got from the wall of customers who won the restaurant's eating challenge, which shows Sam and Samuel in the background, behind a winner) Come on. Let's get the hell out of here."
249,DEAN,"Hey, come on. Hop to, would you?"
249,SAM,"We can't go, Dean."
249,DEAN,"Uh, yeah, we can."
249,SAM,"No, listen—five guys went missing a year ago. They never found the bodies. I mean, that's got to be the job me and Samuel worked, right?"
249,DEAN,Great. What difference does it make?
249,SAM,"A year ago, five guys go missing, and—and now suddenly all these women go missing. Something's here. So either we just didn't stop it, or we only thought we did."
249,DEAN,"Okay, but why the gender bend, huh? First it's dudes. Now it's chicks? That's a totally different M.O."
249,SAM,"I don't know. Who knows? The point is, something's still here."
249,DEAN,Great. We'll call Bobby. He can deal with it.
249,SAM,Why? We can deal with it.
249,DEAN,"Are you serious? Sam, there is a reason that hunters don't hit the same town over again—'cause we have a habit of leaving messes behind."
249,SAM,Right. I agree.
249,DEAN,One of dad's rules -- you never use the same crapper twice.
249,SAM,Everyone uses the same crapper twice.
249,DEAN,Not us. You know what I mean.
249,SAM,"Okay, look—this creature is still walking around 'cause of me, right? I mean, I let it go. Dad also said, ""you finish what you start."" Okay, I get it."
249,DEAN,Do you?
249,SAM,"Yes. You're afraid I'll stroll down memory lane and I'll kick this wall in my head so hard, Hell comes flooding through, right? And then all of a sudden, I'm some drooling mess on the floor."
249,DEAN,It's not a joke.
249,SAM,"Okay. I know. But listen—what's happening here right now—it's because I messed up somehow, in some big way. So every person who gets taken, every person who dies—that's on me. I have to stop it. And you'd do the same thing."
249,DEAN,All right. I'll follow up with the brunettes. You see what you get from the cops.
254,DEAN,"Elkins, huh?"
